To tackle this\nproblem, an analyst must first clearly understand\nwhat the market cares about and then decipher the\ndrivers of shareholder wealth. Further, only to the\nextent that these value drivers are different from, or\ntangential to, the day-to-day investment chatter can\nthey be considered of incremental informational or\nanalytical value.\nThis report seeks to outline a solution to this invest-\ning challenge. We have attempted to do this in a few\nsteps. First, we use basic statistical tools to under-\nstand the elements that best explain valuation in the\npackaged food industry. We then consider what our\nempirical evidence says about stock market behav-\nior. Finally, we outline the facets of value that\nshould be the focus of managers and investors alike.\nOur conclusion also serves as our title: translated\ninto English, it simply means \u201cthe more things\nchange, the more they stay the same.\u201d That is,\ncompanies can partake in M&A, write-offs, restruc-\nturing programs, strategic repositionings, and\naccounting chicanery, but at the end of the day what\nmatters is a company\u2019s ability to generate satisfac-\ntory cash returns on the capital it employs. Doing so\nconsistently in the face of a rapidly changing busi-\nness world requires hard work, foresight, and\ndiscipline. The philosopher Baruch Spinoza\u2019s words\nring true for managers: \u201cAll things excellent are as\ndifficult as they are rare.\u201d\nStudy Results\nWe performed a regression analysis on packaged\nfood industry data for 1995, 1990, and 1985 using\nthe return on invested capital (ROIC) versus\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) spread as\nthe independent variable, and enterprise value to\ninvested capital as the dependent variable. As fi-\nnance theory (and common sense) would suggest,\nour results show that the correlation between return\nspreads and valuation was quite strong over a\nten-year measurement period. As important, the\nt-statistics were impressive, demonstrating that the\nmodel has substantial explanatory power. Table 1\nsummarizes our r-squared and t-statistic findings,\nand Charts1-3 show the actual plots. Further, all of\nthe empirical work we have done suggests that the\nROIC to WACC spread is a better indicator of\nvaluation than other widely used value proxies, in-\ncluding earnings per share growth and return on\nequity.1\nTable 1\nReturn Spreads Correlate Well with Valuation\nYear\nR-squared\nt-statistic\n1995\n88%\n10.3\n1990\n55\n3.5\n1985\n80\n6.7\nSource: Published data, CS First Boston estimates.\nThere are two other noteworthy points about our\nresults. First is that the y-intercept (the enterprise\nvalue/invested capital at a zero spread) remained\nstable over the decade we tracked. Second, the slope\nof the regression line steepened over the measured\ntime series. We hypothesize why these conditions\nhave emerged:\n\u2022 The y-intercept\u2014the point where the return on\ncapital equals the cost of capital\u2014remained nearly\nconstant at about 1.6 times enterprise value to in-\nvested capital over the three measurement periods.\n(In theory, if the ROIC equals WACC, the enter-\nprise value should equal 1.0 times invested capital.)\nWe believe there are two potential explanations for\nthis observation. The first is that invested capital\nmay be understated as the result of inflation. As-\nsuming that the average life of fixed assets for a\nfood company is roughly five years\u2014depreciation\nregularly represents 10% of net property plant and\nequipment in the industry\u2014and that inflation equals\n3%, invested capital may be understated by 15-\n20%. This observation, when coupled with the the-\nsis that the market\u2019s view of the industry has not\nchanged dramatically in the measured period, ex-\nplains both the y-intercept\u2019s above-1.0 multiple and\nits consistency. Second, we believe the market is\nlikely impounding future value creation, meaning\nthat the present value of growth opportunities has\nhad a positive value. This may not be an unreason-\nable assumption in an industry that has had, on\nbalance, returns that exceed the cost of capital dur-\ning the past decade.\n                                                       \n1See \u201cPackaged Food Industry Rate of Return\nAnalysis,\u201d July 1994.\n"

This means\nthat for any given positive ROIC-WACC spread,\nthe multiple of enterprise value to invested capital\nhas become higher over time; given a negative\nROIC-WACC spread, the multiple of enterprise\nvalue to invested capital trends lower over time.\nAgain, note that the y-intercept has not changed. We\nbelieve there are two plausible explanations for this.\nFirst, we sense there might be a \u201crich get richer and\npoor get poorer\u201d phenomenon, justifying the fact\nthat high-return companies are enjoying higher rela-\ntive valuations and low-return companies are\nreceiving lower multiples. In finance terms, we\nmight say that the \u201ccompetitive advantage period\u201d is\ndeemed to be expanding for the best competitively\npositioned companies, and shrinking for weak return\nbusinesses.2 Second, lower interest rates\u2014expressed\nmore specifically in our analysis as a lower\nweighted average cost of capital\u2014have had a mag-\nnifying affect on enterprise value to invested capital\nmultiples (see Table 2).\nTable 2\nHow ROIC/WACC Ratio Defines Multiples\n1985\n1990\n1995\nROIC-WACC spread\n4.0%\n4.0%\n4.0%\nEnterprise value/invested capital\n2.05\n2.36\n2.52\nSource: Company published data, CS First Boston estimates.\nStated differently, when the ROIC to WACC spread\nis positive and constant, the enterprise value to in-\nvested capital ratio will increase as WACC falls.\nInversely, if the ROIC to WACC spread is negative\nand constant, the enterprise value to invested capital\nratio declines as WACC falls.3 The math behind this\npoint is laid out in the appendix.\nAlthough our analysis firmly suggests that the mar-\nket appreciates high-return businesses, it is incorrect\nto conclude that a manager\u2019s sole objective is to\nmaximize returns on invested capital. In fact, man-\n                                                       \n2Competitive advantage period is the time during which\na company is assumed to earn returns in excess of the\ncost of capital on incremental projects.\n3The author is indebted to Charlie Wolf for clarifying\nthis point.  In determining the enterprise value/invested\ncapital relationship, the ratio of ROIC to WACC is the\nkey variable, not necessarily the spread itself.\nagement\u2019s prime goal should be to maximize the\ndifference between enterprise value and invested\ncapital.\nTable 3 outlines why this point is valid. Assume an\nall-equity financed company has two strategy op-\ntions. It can either continue on its present course\n(scenario A), delivering $20 of earnings on a $100\ninvested capital base, or invest an additional $100\ninto its business at an incremental rate of return of\n15% (scenario B). Assuming a 10% cost of capital\nand 20 shares outstanding, the business is worth\n$20 per share under scenario A, with a price-to-\nbook ratio of 2.0 times and an ROIC of 20%. Under\nscenario B\u2014assuming the capital addition was fi-\nnanced by issuing shares\u2014the ROIC, price/book\nratio and shares outstanding all get diluted. How-\never, the value of each share rises almost 17%. This\nis precisely why we believe managers should avoid\ncompensation programs linked solely to return on\ninvested capital.\nTable 3\nWealth Maximization Not Tied Solely to ROIC\nScenario A\nScenario B\nNOPAT\n$20\n$35\nInvested capital\n100\n200\nWACC\n10%\n10%\nROIC\n20\n17.5\nValue\n$200\n$350\nPrice/book\n2.0\n1.75\nShares outstanding\n10\n15\nValue per share\n$20.00\n$23.33\nMessage from the Market\nWe can draw two important conclusions about what\nour evidence says about capital markets behavior.\nThe first is that the market recognizes and impounds\nvalue creation by granting a multiple of invested\ncapital in excess of 1.0. This is often called the \u201c$1\ntest.\u201d Second, the market is consistent in this regard\nover time, meaning it \u201ccares about\u201d returns on in-\nvested capital day in, day out and year in, year out.\nWarren Buffett, one of America\u2019s most successful\ninvestors, described the use of the \u201c$1 test\u201d in his\n1982 Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders.

The\ncentral point is that how much or how little man-\nagement invests back into the business is not as\nimportant as the concept that all capital tied up in a\nbusiness pull its economic weight. Further, the mar-\nket generally clearly sees whether or not this is\noccurring.\nIf Buffett\u2019s comments from 1982 are not enough\nevidence of this \u201c$1 test\u201d holding true over time, a\nglimpse at the relationship between return spreads\nand the enterprise value to invested capital ratio\nbrings to life the $1 test when analyzing a single\ncompany. Chart 4 shows the year-end spreads and\nenterprise value to invested capital multiples for\nQuaker Oats. What stands out is that the return\nspread and multiple were at their highest in fiscal\n1994 and their lowest in fiscal 1995 (as a result of\nthe Snapple deal). Remarkably, the market simply\nrepriced the multiple accorded the business to adjust\nto the new, low-ROIC reality. The more things\nchange, the more they stay the same.\nMessage to Management\nOur overriding message to management is that\nmaximizing shareholder value should be its primary\ngoal. There are two fundamental drivers of share-\nholder wealth to which managers should be\nsensitive. First, there should be an unrelenting focus\non making sure that all the capital lodged in the\nbusiness generates returns in excess of the cost of\ncapital (or can reasonably be expected to do so),\nwith an eye toward returning nonproductive capital\nback to shareholders. Second, managers should\nconstantly seek to invest in value-creating projects\nand strategies. We will develop these points in more\ndetail.\nIn Roger Lowenstein\u2019s excellent book on Warren\nBuffett, the author recounts the exchange between\nBuffett and the newly appointed president of Berk-\nshire Hathaway, Ken Chance. It was 1965 and\n                                                       \n4Berkshire Letters to Shareholders, 1977-1983, p. 52.\nBuffett had just taken control of Berkshire. The\nstock was at $18 per share.5 Lowenstein writes:\n\u201cThen Buffett explained to Chance the basic theory\nof return on investment. He didn\u2019t particularly care\nhow much yarn Chance produced, or even how\nmuch he sold. Nor was Buffett interested in the total\nprofit as an isolated number. What counted was the\nprofit as a percentage of the capital invested. That\nwas the yardstick by which Buffett would grade\nChance\u2019s performance.\n\u201cTo Chance, who had been reared, like most man-\nagers, to think of growth as an absolute good, this\nidea was new. But he grasped that is was pivotal to\nBuffett\u2019s capitalist credo, and Buffett put in terms\nthat Chance could understand.\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019d rather have a $10 million business making 15\npercent than a $100 million business making 5 per-\ncent,\u2019 Buffett said. \u2018I have other places I can put\nthe money.\u2019\u201d6\nEvery portfolio manager should hold managers to\nthe same discipline, because portfolio managers do\nhave other places they can put the money (i.e., other\nstocks). We sense that too much of the dialogue in\nthe investment business deals with near-term ac-\ncounting-based results, and that not enough\nattention is paid to capital allocation.\nIn the same context, it is worth considering the\nmagnitude of capital lodged in businesses that does\nnot earn (or does not have the prospects of earning)\na satisfactory return. Marakon Associates, a con-\nsulting firm that concentrates on value-based\nperformance measuring and planning, states that, in\nits experience, 100% of the value created for most\ncompanies is concentrated in less than 50% of the\ncapital employed.7 This figure suggests that even\nwithin the United States\u2014likely the most competi-\ntive economy in the world\u2014there remains\nsubstantial opportunity to unlock value.\n                                                       \n5The stock rose 27% compounded annually in the sub-\nsequent 30 years.\n6Roger Lowenstein, Buffett: The Making of an Ameri-\ncan Capitalist (New York: Random House, 1995), pp.\n131-132.\n7McTaggart, Kontes, Mankins, The Value Imperative\n(New York: The Free Press, 1994), p. 241.\n"

This seemingly ob-\nvious comment has a couple of more subtle\nimplications. First, managers must be sensitive to\nall balance sheet items that add to invested capital,\nnot just obvious ones like capital expenditures and\nacquisitions. A good example is working capital,\nwhich often does not get the scrutiny it deserves.\nSecond, we believe it is necessary to distinguish\nbetween projects and strategies. There are times\nwhen an investment outlay, viewed strictly on a net\npresent value basis, may not provide the right an-\nswer in overall value creation. For example, a\ncompany may invest in a project that is NPV nega-\ntive when the alternative strategy (i.e., doing\nnothing) has even less value. Hence we stress that\nmanagers invest in strategies that maximize the\nvalue of the firm. That noted, we believe too many\nmanagers hide behind the cloak of \u201cstrategic\u201d in-\nvestments as they misallocate capital. Simply stated,\ncapital allocation, in the broadest sense of the term,\nis management\u2019s central long-term task.\nMessage to Analysts/Portfolio Managers\nIf in fact the ROIC to WACC spread (financial) is\nthe key driver of the enterprise value to invested\ncapital multiple (valuation), it would appear worth-\nwhile to consider how an analyst might gain a\ncompetitive advantage. We believe the proper ap-\nproach to this question is to dissect the ROIC to\nWACC spread into its prime components.\nIf one dismisses the WACC part of the equation to\nsimplify the analysis (and we do recognize that\nvalue can be derived from good management of the\nright-hand side of the balance sheet), ROIC moves\ninto the spotlight. ROIC, in turn, can be broken\ndown into net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT)\ndivided by invested capital. NOPAT correlates quite\nwell with earnings, and, as a result, does not appear\nto be an area where an analyst can derive a sustain-\nable advantage. Invested capital, however, tends to\nget proportionately less attention, and hence may be\na better area for analytical focus. In other words,\nanalysts who dig to understand the allocation of\ncapital and the prospective returns on the employed\ncapital may be better able to appreciate future\nearnings power and the direction of valuation mul-\ntiples (including multiples of earnings and cash\nflow).\nNot surprisingly, we find that the way of gaining an\nedge as an investor is identical to the method of\ngaining a competitive advantage as a manager. Un-\nderstand where the capital is going, how much is\ngoing there, and at what return that capital will be\ngreeted. As simple as it sounds in theory, it is ex-\ntraordinarily difficult to pursue in practice.\nN.B.: CS First Boston Corporation may have, within the last three years,\nserved as a manager or co-manager of a public offering of securities for or\nmakes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies mentioned.\nClosing prices are as of December 11, 1995:\nCampbell Soup (CPB, 59, Hold)\nConAgra (CAG, 401/8, Hold)\nCPC International (CPC, 701/4, Hold)\nGeneral Mills (GIS, 551/4, Buy)\nH.J.

It is a function of internal and\nexternal factors such as industry structure, com-\npetitive position, government policy, and overall\nmarket confidence. In a nuts and bolts sense, CAP\nrepresents the forecast period for a discounted cash\nflow model.\nEconomic Book Value (EBV)\nThe \u201csteady state\u201d value of the firm, or the value of\nthe firm assuming no incremental value will be cre-\nated. It equals the company\u2019s most recent net\noperating profit after tax (NOPAT) capitalized by\nthe company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital mi-\nnus debt. A price-to-economic-book-value ratio of\n1.0 suggests the market expects no value creation.\nAny ratio above 1.0 assumes value creation and\nanything below 1.0 assumes value destruction.\nEconomic Value Added (EVA)\nSeeks to determine the \u201cresidual\u201d income of a com-\npany by charging NOPAT with a capital charge.\nEVA can be positive only when a company\u2019s\nNOPAT is greater than the minimum return re-\nquired by capital providers for the net assets the\ncompany employs. The formula is:\nNOPAT - (invested capital * WACC)\nEnterprise Value\nMarket value of equity (shares outstanding times\nstock price) plus total debt (short-term and long-\nterm) plus preferred stock.\nFree Cash Flow (FCF)\nRepresents the cash that is distributable to all\nclaimholders. It is after tax, after capital investment\n(working and fixed capital spending), but before\nfinancing costs. Free cash flow is the difference\nbetween NOPAT and I. FCF is the number that is\nprojected and discounted to a present value in a dis-\ncounted cash flow model.\nInvested Capital\nSum of the net assets a company employs to gener-\nate its cash flows. As net assets must be financed,\ninvested capital may be calculated from either side\nof the balance sheet. From the asset side, invested\ncapital equals net working capital, net PP & E,\ngoodwill and other operating assets.\nInvestment in Future Growth (I)\nRepresents the change in working capital, capital\nexpenditures (net of depreciation) and cash acquisi-\ntions a company makes on an annual basis. I\nrepresents the \u201cfuel\u201d a company must use to grow\nits NOPAT.\nMarket Value Added (MVA)\nThe difference between a company\u2019s market value\nand its invested capital. Generally, if MVA is posi-\ntive the market believes a company will generate\nreturns above its cost of capital.\nNet Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)\nRepresents the cash profits a company would earn if\nit were completely debt-free. Operating income is\nreduced by adjusted taxes\u2014which incorporate the\ncash taxes paid and the value of the tax shield from\ninterest expense\u2014and is increased by the amortiza-\ntion of goodwill. NOPAT is the numerator for an\nROIC calculation.\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nNet operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by\naverage invested capital. ROIC shows a company\u2019s\ncash rate of return on the sum of capital it has put\nto work. When compared to the weighted average\ncost of capital, ROIC can help determine whether or\nnot a company is creating value for its shareholders.\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\nReflects the opportunity cost for debt and equity\nholders, weighted for their relative contribution to a\ncompany\u2019s capital structure. It is the minimum\neconomic return a company must generate to com-\npensate its debt and equity security holders for their\nassumed risk.\n"
