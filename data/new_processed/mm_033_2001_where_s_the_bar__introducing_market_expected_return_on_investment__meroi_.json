      "text": "Where\u2019s the Bar?\n12 June 2001\n2\nExecutive Summary\nBoth investors and managers must have a clear understanding of economic returns on\ninvestment to intelligently allocate capital. But the needs of investors and managers are\ndifferent. Managers seek to make investments that generate returns above the cost of\ncapital. Value creation is the guiding factor.\nInvestors, on the other hand, take a different approach. Their decisions are based on\nrevisions in expectations for a company\u2019s financial performance. Investors have no\nreason to believe that a company generating attractive economic returns will provide\nsuperior returns if the stock market fully reflects the company\u2019s above-average\nprospects.\nInvestors need to be able to measure the economic return on investment that the\nmarket anticipates to calibrate whether or not the expectations embedded in stock\nprices are reasonable. Unfortunately, widely used measures do a poor job of capturing\ntrue economic returns on investment.\nIn this report, we introduce market-expected return on investment (MEROI) as an\nimportant complement to the expectations investing toolkit. MEROI provides a good\nsense of where the rate of return performance bar is set.\nThere are four key points in this report.\n1. Traditional measures miss the mark. Most traditional return measures\u2014such as\nreturn on equity, return on invested capital, and return on incremental invested\ncapital\u2014do not fully capture economic returns.\n2. MEROI provides a complete picture of expected returns. MEROI is the internal\nrate of return a company is expected to earn on its incremental investments. It\ndoes not rely on sunk costs, but rather captures all operating sources of value\ninflows and outflows.\n3. A valuable addition to the expectations-investing process. Expectations investing\nstarts by reading market expectations for a company\u2019s financial performance, and\nthen applies appropriate strategic and financial tools to judge whether the market\u2019s\nexpectations are appropriate. MEROI can provide useful context in this judgment.\n4. Case study. We use Cisco Systems as an example of this analysis. We first\ncalculated Cisco\u2019s return on investment for the 1990s (around 20%) and note that\nthe expected returns embedded in its shares today (June 2001) are approximately\n25%. These figures may be useful in determining the attractiveness of the shares.\n"

      "text": "Where\u2019s the Bar?\n12 June 2001\n3\nIntroduction\nFinance theory suggests, and everyday experience corroborates, that the present value\nof future free cash flows determines the value of a financial asset. Further, most\ninvestors realize that the key to successful investing is to correctly anticipate revisions in\nexpectations for a company\u2019s free cash flow. But a successful application of an\nexpectations-based approach requires more than just an appreciation of how the market\nvalues a company, it also requires an understanding of what expectations of future\nfinancial performance a stock\u2019s price currently reflects.\nWe can distill valuation into three prime components: future cash flows, a required rate\nof return, and a period of excess returns (which we like to call competitive advantage\nperiod, or CAP). As it turns out, the stock market dictates the latter two determinants\n(discount rate and CAP), so analysts are correct to focus their energy on revisions to\nfuture cash flows.\nIn turn, we can specify cash flows with two variables that shape business models:\ngrowth in net operating profit after tax and return on investment. Investments are current\noutlays that have multiperiod returns. A company\u2019s typical investments include changes\nin working capital, capital spending (above and beyond depreciation), and acquisitions.\nGrowth in net operating profit after tax is a function of sales growth and operating profit\nmargins.1\nReturn on investment captures the relationship between a company\u2019s investments and\nits future net operating profit after tax. To state the obvious, the higher the return the\nbetter (all things equal), because the less capital a company requires to support its\nearnings growth, the more cash available for distribution to claimholders. We focus on\ndefining the best measure of forward-looking return on investment.\nWhile measuring market-expected returns is conceptually straightforward, investors\nrarely do it correctly in practice. This report provides investors with a valuable tool to\nmeasure market-expected returns, which we call market-expected return on investment,\nor MEROI. We believe that MEROI is a very useful number in the quest for revisions\nin expectations.\nThe math of MEROI closely follows the concept of corporate return developed by Alfred\nRappaport2, who wanted to demonstrate how corporate executives could measure their\nability to deliver superior shareholder returns. The necessary hurdle was not simply the\ncost of capital, Rappaport argued, but rather the rate expected by the stock market. We\ntailor the concept for investors.\nThis report has four parts. First, we compare and contrast various \u201creturn\u201d measures.\nSecond, we provide the intellectual and economic underpinnings of MEROI, and show\nhow to calculate it. Third, we place MEROI within the context of expectations investing.\nFinally, we provide an example of how to use MEROI.\n"

      "text": "Where\u2019s the Bar?\n12 June 2001\n4\nEstimating Returns on Investment\nWhile news of earnings growth tends to fill the business press headlines, astute\ninvestors recognize the importance of understanding growth in the context of economic\nreturns. Indeed, growth just amplifies returns. For companies that generate returns\nabove a required rate, growth is good. For those companies that earn returns below the\nrequired rate growth is bad. And growth has no effect on a business that earns exactly\nits opportunity cost.\nThe real question is how to measure returns. We look at a few of the most widely used\nmetrics\u2014including return on equity, return on assets, return on invested capital, and\nreturn on incremental invested capital\u2014and show why they come up short in reflecting\neconomic reality.\nEach of these return metrics suffer from at least one of two broad shortcomings. The\nfirst is that they are typically not long-term oriented. Think of an example of a company\nthat consists of a single project\u2014say, a restaurant. The first day the restaurant is open\nfor business the return will look awful; the denominator includes the full investment while\nthe numerator reflects either losses or nominal profits. Fast forward a decade and a\none-day return looks terrific; the restaurant is at peak earnings power and is completely\ndepreciated. Neither short-term return reflects the long-term economics of the project.3\nSecond, these return metrics fail to accurately reflect value inflows and outflows\nbecause they rely either on accounting numbers or incomplete economic measures.\nWe next review the four most widely used metrics.\nReturn on Equity (ROE)\nROE, defined as net income divided by shareholder equity, probably remains the most\nwidely used measure of investment efficiency. Despite its popularity, ROE is fraught\nwith three shortcomings.\n1. The numerator of ROE, earnings, is flawed because companies can compute it\nusing alternative accounting methods.\n2. The denominator of ROE, equity, is flawed because it is subject to accounting\nvagaries (i.e., share buybacks and FASB 106).\n3. ROE mixes operating and financing issues. For example, often a company\u2019s ROE\nincreases when it increases its financial leverage. Further, any debt-financed project\nthat generates returns greater than the cost of debt will add to ROE, but may not\ncreate shareholder value.\nHistoric or prospective ROE has severe limitations in its ability to reflect expectations for\neconomic returns on investment.4\nReturn on Assets (ROA)\nCalculated as earnings divided by assets, ROA has the same shortcomings as\nROE. It has both a flawed numerator and denominator, and can be affected by\nfinancing decisions.\n"

      "text": "Where\u2019s the Bar?\n12 June 2001\n5\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nROIC equals net operating profit after tax divided by invested capital (or, equivalently,\ncapital employed).5 It is the best of the accounting-based numbers because the\nnumerator is an economically sound starting point. But the denominator is still an\naccumulation of sunk costs, and does not provide insight about the future.\nSo historical invested capital may be an instructive figure\u2014it provides some sense\nof past capital allocation skill\u2014but it does not speak to the future. Investors can try\nto sidestep this problem in one of two ways. First, investors can consider changes\nin invested capital. This calculation, however, intermingles sunk costs with\nincremental investments.\nThe second alternative is to consider only incremental earnings and investment. These\nlead to our final return measure.\nReturn on Incremental Invested Capital (ROIIC)\nROIIC considers the relationship between incremental investment and incremental net\noperating profit after tax. As a result, it is totally forward looking and avoids the problem\nof sunk costs. ROIIC generally incorporates a one-year time lag. For example, a 20%\nROIIC would assume that $100 invested this year would add $20 to next year\u2019s net\noperating profit after tax.\nWhile ROIIC has substantial intuitive appeal, we believe that its primary and best use is\nas a method to estimate future investment needs. It is an inaccurate measure of\neconomic returns: it overstates economic returns for value-creating businesses\n(especially those with long CAPs) and understates economic returns for companies not\nearning the cost of capital. As a result of these distortions, ROIIC provides little context\nfor understanding true economic returns.\nWhy doesn\u2019t ROIIC approximate economic returns? We\u2019ll save the full explanation until\nafter we describe market-expected return on investment in some more detail. But here\u2019s\nthe intuition. A company\u2019s value creation in a given year is a function of two things: the\ncash flow it generates and the change in its residual value. You might think of the cash\nflow as dividends and the change in residual value as capital gains. ROIIC only reflects\nthe dividends. Since ROIIC only captures part of the economic picture, it compensates\nby being more variant than the more sound market-expected return on investment.\nWe have now established two central points: understanding returns is important in\nunderstanding value creation, and the most widely used measures do a poor job of\ncapturing economic returns. We now introduce a more robust framework.\n"

      "text": "Where\u2019s the Bar?\n12 June 2001\n6\nMarket-Expected Return on Investment (MEROI)\nThe intellectual roots for MEROI are in Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani\u2019s famous\n1961 paper \u201cDividend Policy, Growth and the Valuation of Shares.\u201d6 That paper\ndemonstrated that a stock is valued equivalently as the present value of future free cash\nflows or as the sum of a firm\u2019s steady-state value plus all future value creation.7\nWhile these two methods are mathematically equivalent, they represent very different\nanalytical perspectives.\nThat a company\u2019s value is the present value of its future free cash flows is familiar to\nmost investors, and was set forth in The Theory of Investment Value, a seminal book\nwritten by John Burr Williams in 1938. More specifically, this approach divides corporate\nvalue into two components: the present value of free cash flow during the competitive\nadvantage period and the present value of the company beyond the CAP (or the\npresent value of the residual value). Exhibit 1 shows an example of this approach.\nExhibit 1: Shareholder Value\nYear\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNOPAT \n100.0\n           \n111.0\n  \n123.2\n      \n136.8\n     \n151.8\n  \n168.5\n    \n187.0\n     \nInvestment\n73.3\n             \n81.4\n    \n90.4\n        \n100.3\n     \n111.3\n  \n123.6\n    \nFree cash flow\n26.7\n             \n29.6\n    \n32.9\n        \n36.5\n       \n40.5\n    \n44.9\n      \nPV of free cash flow\n24.2\n             \n24.5\n    \n24.7\n        \n24.9\n       \n25.1\n    \n25.4\n      \n\u03a3 PV of free cash flow \n148.8\n      \nResidual value\n1,870.4\n   \n\u03a3 PV of free cash flow\n148.8\n      \nPV of Residual value\n1,055.8\n   \nCorporate Value\n1,204.6\n   \nNote: Cost of capital = 10%\nSource: CSFB.\nThe second valuation approach, which is the key to understanding MEROI, takes what\nthe business is worth today and adds to it future value creation. Rappaport calls the first\nterm baseline value and the second term shareholder value added (SVA).8 Baseline\nvalue reflects the status quo: it assumes no additional value creation (i.e., future\ninvestments have a zero net present value). SVA, in contrast, captures the expected\nvalue change. For a company to improve its SVA over time, its net operating profit after\ntax must increase at a rate that more than compensates for its incremental investments.\nThere are two ways to calculate aggregate SVA. The first (which we alluded to above\nwith our dividend and capital gains example) is to take the sum of the cumulative\npresent value of free cash flows and the cumulative change in the present value of the\nresidual value.9\nExhibit 2 shows the calculation. As an illustration, year one SVA of $33.3 equals the\npresent value of free cash flow ($24.2) plus the change in the present value of the\nresidual value ($9.1). Sum the SVAs from each of the six years of the assumed CAP,\nand you get aggregate SVA of $204.6.\n"

Here, we capitalize each year\u2019s change in NOPAT and discount them back to\nthe present at the cost of capital. We obtain SVA by subtracting the present value of all\nthe incremental investments over the forecast period from the present value of the\ncapitalized NOPAT increases in each year of the forecast period.\nHere again, the intuition is straightforward: a company generates positive shareholder\nvalue added when the present value of its incremental earnings exceeds the present\nvalue of its incremental investments. This is simply a restatement of the tried-and-true\nnet present value rule.\nExhibit 3 shows the calculation. We see that present value of capitalized NOPAT\nchanges is $613.8 and the present value of future investments is $409.2. The difference\nbetween the two ($613.8 - $409.2) equals SVA of $204.6. When SVA is positive, we\nknow that a company is earning at a rate (or investors expect it to earn at a rate) above\nthe cost of capital. So we know that MEROI exceeds than the cost of capital.\nExhibit 3: Estimating SVA: Capitalized PV NOPAT minus PV Investments\nBase\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nNOPAT\n100.0\n111.0\n123.2\n136.8\n151.8\n168.5\n187.0\n\u2206 NOPAT\n11.0\n12.2\n13.6\n15.0\n16.7\n18.5\nInflows\n\u2206 NOPAT capitalized\n110.0\n122.1\n135.5\n150.4\n167.0\n185.4\nSum\nPV \u2206 NOPAT capitalized\n100.0\n100.9\n101.8\n102.8\n103.7\n104.6\n613.8\n\u03a3 PV of \u2206 NOPAT capitalized\nOutflows\nInvestment\n73.3\n81.4\n90.4\n100.3\n111.3\n123.6\nSum\nPV of investment\n66.7\n67.3\n67.9\n68.5\n69.1\n69.8\n409.2\nInflows minus outflows equal Total\nSVA\nShareholder value added\n33.3\n33.6\n33.9\n34.3\n34.6\n34.9\n204.6\nNote: Cost of capital = 10%\nSource: CSFB.\nNow that we have exposed the intuitive logic behind SVA, we can employ a\nmathematical shorthand. As it turns out, discounting the perpetuity value of the change\nin NOPAT each forecast year is equivalent to discounting free cash flow for each\nforecast year and adding the change in perpetuity value at the end of the forecast\nperiod. We demonstrate the equivalence of these approaches in Appendix 1. This\nsimplifies the calculation.\n"

Create a discounted cash flow model that reflects a company\u2019s current\nstock price.\n2. Calculate the present value of future investments discounted at the cost\nof capital.\n3. Determine the discount rate that equates the present value of the capitalized\nannual NOPAT changes with the present value of the future investments.\nLet\u2019s walk through an example to illustrate the MEROI calculation.\nStep 1: Let\u2019s continue with our six-year discounted cash flow model.

You can check this by dividing\nthe change in year two versus year one NOPAT ($111.0\u2013$100.0=$11.0) by the year\none investment (73.3). This equals 15% ($11/$73.3=15%).\n\u2022 The cost of capital is 10%.\n\u2022 An explicit forecast horizon of six years.\n\u2022 The residual value equals year seven NOPAT ($168.5*1.11=$187.0) divided by the\ncost of capital, or $187/10%=$1,870.4.\nGiven these assumptions, corporate value is $1,204.6.

      "text": "Where\u2019s the Bar?\n12 June 2001\n11\nThe Role of MEROI in Expectations Investing\nWe now place MEROI in its appropriate context within expectations investing. The core\nexpectations investing process has three steps.12\n1. Estimate the market expectations for future cash flows, cost of capital, and CAP that\njustify a company\u2019s stock price. It is important to remain agnostic in this step. The\nkey is to reverse engineer embedded expectations: to read the mind of the market.\nOnce you have determined the magnitude and sustainability of cash flows that solve\nfor the price, you can calculate the implied MEROI.13\n2. Identify potential opportunities for revisions in expectations. Here, you must apply\nthe appropriate strategic frameworks to anticipate shifts in the competitive land-\nscape. Further, financial tools allow you to understand the impact on shareholder\nvalue when expectations change for the fundamental triggers\u2014sales, operating\ncosts or investments\u2014allowing you to focus analytical energy. MEROI is a useful\nbenchmark for expectations: very high or low MEROI may portend revisions\nin expectations.\n3. Make buy, sell, or hold decisions based on expected value analysis given a range\nof potential performance scenarios.\nWe noted at the outset that the market sets the cost of capital and competitive advan-\ntage period. As a result, investors are best served by focusing on potential revisions in\ncash flow expectations. MEROI can provide an important reference point, as investors\n(including those who use DCF models) often don\u2019t explicitly consider the market\nexpected return on investment.\nInvestors and managers can use MEROI to check the reasonableness of embedded\nexpectations. This prompts some important questions.\n\u2022 Are expected MEROIs consistent with what the company has earned in the past?\n\u2022 Is the competitive environment conducive to the expected MEROI? and\n\u2022 What MEROI does a target price imply?\nEconomic theory suggests that competitive entry and rivalry are likely to limit the upper\nbound of MEROI. Rapid expected growth rates and high MEROIs are fertile grounds for\nfinding sell candidates.\nROIIC Is Not a Complete Economic Measure\nAs a practical matter, investors should note that ROIIC becomes more and more\ndistorted the longer the assumed investment horizon, or CAP. The reason, again,\nrelates to the sources of value creation. Since ROIIC only measures changes in NOPAT\nand doesn\u2019t consider changes in the residual value, it captures less and less of the\naggregate source of value as CAP extends.\nExhibit 7 illustrates this point. The rows represent various CAPs\u2014periods of above-cost-\nof-capital returns. The columns span a wide range of ROIICs. The cells are populated\nwith the MEROIs, a correct measure of economic returns. For example, a 70% ROIIC\nfor 20 years equates an MEROI of about 24%\u2014in other words, ROIIC overstates the\neconomic returns by nearly a factor of three.\n"

When ROIIC equals the cost of capital (10% in this case), MEROI will also\nequal the cost of capital. This occurs when a company has zero anticipated\nshareholder value added\u2014future investments equal exactly the cost of capital.\n2. When ROIIC exceeds the cost of capital, the ROIIC is always greater than the\nMEROI. Further, the degree of distortion increases as the CAP lengthens.\n3. When ROIIC is below the cost of capital, ROIIC is always lower than MEROI.\nMEROI is also important because it helps reveal where investors need to allocate\nanalytical energy. Low MEROI companies warrant a focus on capital allocation. For\ncompanies with high MEROIs, growth is generally the most important factor in\nanticipating revisions in expectations.\n"

      "text": "Where\u2019s the Bar?\n12 June 2001\n13\nCase Study\nInvestors can best use market-expected return on investment to assess the reasonable-\nness of current price-implied expectations. MEROIs that appear unrealistically high may\nportend a downward revision in expectations\u2014and hence a lower stock price\u2014and a\nvery low MEROI may signal room for upward expectations.\nThat said, we can demonstrate the mechanics of MEROI, as well as get a sense\nof perspective, by calculating a company\u2019s actual returns on investment. This calculation\nimagines that an investor (or manager) is standing at a point in the past and has\nperfect foresight about future NOPATs and investments. We use Cisco Systems as\nour example.\nBefore we proceed, we must emphasize two points. First, the value of this exercise is to\nobserve the actual economic returns. This baseline may also be useful in assessing the\nmarket\u2019s current expected returns. Second, we do not assume here that the actual\nresults reflected the market expectations at any given point in history. We do not use\nthis ex post analysis to show how one would have invested in Cisco stock. MEROI is\nsimply a means to calculate Cisco\u2019s past economic returns on investment.\nExhibit 8 shows the data for Cisco. We take the company\u2019s investments\u2014including\nworking capital changes, capital expenditures (net of depreciation) and acquisitions\u2014\nfrom fiscal 1989 to fiscal 1999. Since we pretend as if we are standing at August 1,\n1988, we take the present value those investments discounted at the cost of capital\n(12%). Note that we measure all acquisitions based on the value that Cisco imparted to\nthe sellers, irrespective of financing or accounting treatment.\nNext we determine the discount rate required (return on investment) to make the\npresent value of the changes in annual NOPAT from fiscal 1990 to fiscal 2000 equal to\nthe present value of investments. As it turns out, Cisco\u2019s return on investment in the\n1990s was almost exactly 20%.\nThis analysis prompts an immediate question: what\u2019s baked into today\u2019s price? In early-\nJune 2001, we estimate that Cisco\u2019s MEROI is about 25%, assuming 22% NOPAT\ngrowth off of the fiscal 2001 base and approximately a 60% ROIIC. Providing these\ngrowth and ROIIC assumptions are reasonable, investors must answer the question of\nwhether future returns are likely to exceed those of the past.\n"

Additional information is available on\nrequest.\nSome investments referred to in the research will be offered solely by a single entity and in the case of some investments solely by CSFB, or an associate of CSFB.\nPast performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made regarding future performance. Information, opinions and\nestimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CSFB and are subject to change.  The price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments\nmentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such\nsecurities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADR\u2019s, the values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk.\nStructured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and assuming the risks involved.\nThe market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity,\nmarket conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer.  Any investor interested in purchasing a structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the\nproduct and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase.\nSome investments discussed in the research may have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that investment is realised.\nThose losses may equal your original investment.  In the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in such circumstances you may be required to pay more\nmoney to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and in consequence initial capital paid to make the investment may be used as part of that income yield.\nSome investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such\nan investment is exposed. The investments and services contained or referred to in this report may not be suitable for you, it is recommended you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt\nabout those investments or investment services.  Nothing in this report constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice nor a representation that any investment or strategy is suitable or appropriate to your\nindividual circumstances.
