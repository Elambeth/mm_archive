      "text": " \n \nJanuary 11, 2016 \n \nCelebrating the Summit \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nA key to investing successfully is the ability to manage emotions in the face of highs and lows. The focus of \nthis report is when one of the stocks in your portfolio rises sharply relative to the market and is not an \nacquisition target. As a portfolio manager you are likely to be pleased about the boost to investment returns \nand flush with a sense of success. As the analyst you might feel proud and self-assured. Enjoying \nachievement is fine to a point. But high emotional arousal is not conducive to good decision making.  \n \nA big winner can create what we call a \u201ccelebrating the summit\u201d moment.2 The idea comes from Laurence \nGonzales, an author and expert on survival in extreme situations, who warns against excessive congratulation \nafter reaching a goal. He points out that mountain climbers commonly celebrate too much at the peak. This \ncauses them to let their guard down just as they are approaching the part of the expedition that may be the \nmost challenging. Gonzales points out that descent is technically more difficult than ascent and that most \nmountaineering accidents occur on the way down. Likewise, selling can be harder than buying. \n \nYou can use a checklist to help make good decisions when emotions are running high. Atul Gawande \ndescribes two types of checklists in his book, The Checklist Manifesto.3 The first is called DO-CONFIRM. \nHere you do your job from memory but pause periodically to make sure that you have done everything you are \nsupposed to do. The second is called READ-DO. Here, you simply read the checklist and do what it says. \nREAD-DO checklists are particularly helpful when you are in the state of high emotional arousal because they \nprevent you from being overcome by emotion as you decide how to act. \n   \nYou can think of your emotional state and the ability to make good decisions as sitting on opposite sides of a \nseesaw. If your state of emotional arousal is high, your capacity to decide well is low. A checklist helps take \nout the emotion and moves you toward a proper choice. It also keeps you from succumbing to decision \nparalysis. A psychologist studying emergency checklists in aviation said the goal is to \u201cminimize the need for a \nlot of effortful analysis when time may be limited and workload is high.\u201d4   \n \nThis report provides you with analytical guidance if one of your stocks rises 10 percent or more in one day \nrelative to the S&P 500. We limit the analysis to stock price rises unrelated to announced mergers and \nacquisitions (M&A). More directly, we want to answer the question of whether you should buy, hold, or sell the \nstock following one of these big moves to the upside.     \n \nExhibit 1 shows the number of such observations for the S&P 500 from January 1990 through mid-2015. \nThere were roughly 6,800 occurrences, with noteworthy clusters around the dot-com bubble and the financial \ncrisis in 2008-2009. The bubble periods contain 36 percent of the observations. These sharp gains happen \nfrequently enough that they deserve a thoughtful process to deal with them but infrequently enough that few \ninvestment firms have developed such a process. Assuming an average number of stock holdings in a mutual \nfund that is benchmarked against the S&P 500, a portfolio manager of a typical mutual fund would encounter \n5-15 \u201ccelebrating the summit\u201d moments per year in low volatility years (e.g., 1994-1997 and 2012-2015) \nand more than 100 such moments in high volatility years (2000-2002 and 2008-2009). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can rely on the specific circumstances of a \nparticular situation as well as your own experience. This is known as the inside view. Or you can examine a \nlarger reference class to understand the base rates. This is known as the outside view.5 \n \nFor example, if you are forecasting the returns for the stock market in the next year you can use the inside \nview to come up with an estimate based on current valuation, sentiment, and your own gut feel. Or you can \nuse the outside view and examine how the stock market has done over the years. Both approaches are useful, \nand there is a specific way to combine the two to allow for an effective forecast.6 But research in decision \nmaking suggests that we naturally rely more on the inside view than we should.7 In fact, it is common for \ninvestors to be unaware of the base rates that are relevant in their decisions.  \n \nWe use base rates to show how stocks perform after they have risen sharply. To do this, we calculate the \n\u201ccumulative abnormal return\u201d for the 30, 60, and 90 trading days after the time of the increase. An abnormal \nreturn is the difference between the total shareholder return and the expected return. A stock\u2019s expected \nreturn reflects the change in a broader stock market index, the S&P 500 in our case, adjusted for risk. The \ncumulative abnormal return, then, is simply the sum of the abnormal returns during the period that we \nmeasure.       \n \nExhibit 2 shows the results for the full sample. The first thing to note is that weak relative stock price results \ngenerally precede the large positive moves. The stocks in the sample rose nearly 14 percentage points versus \nthe S&P 500 on the event date, but fell almost 6 percentage points relative to the market in the 30 days prior \nto the event. Second, the excess returns following a large price gain are on average strongly positive. \n  \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1990\n1993\n1996\n1999\n2002\n2005\n2008\n2011\n2014\nNumber of Observations\n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 11, 2016 \n \nCelebrating the Summit \n4 \nExhibit 2: Full Sample \u2013 Cumulative Abnormal Returns \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \n \nWe refine the large sample into relevant categories in an effort to increase the usefulness of the base rates.8 \nThe first refinement, which exhibit 2 shows, is segregation between earnings and non-earnings \nannouncements. Earnings releases constitute about one-fifth of our sample. Non-earnings announcements \ninclude releases of information that are scheduled, such as same-store sales updates, as well as unanticipated \nannouncements, including a change in management or an earnings update. On balance, returns subsequent \nto non-earnings announcements are greater than those following earnings releases.   \n \nThere is strong evidence in the U.S. markets for \u201cpost-earnings-announcement drift.\u201d9 This is a positive \nrelationship between announced earnings surprises and subsequent stock price changes. For companies that \nreport an upside earnings surprise, cumulative abnormal returns tend to continue to drift up. \n \nThe second refinement is the application of three factors\u2014momentum, valuation, and quality\u2014that consider \ncorporate fundamentals and stock market measures. All companies receive a score for each factor. The \nscores are relative to a company\u2019s peers in the same sector. You can find a detailed definition of the factors in \nAppendix A, but here\u2019s a quick summary: \n \uf402\n Momentum predominantly considers two drivers, change in cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae\uf02a) \nforecasts and stock price momentum. Good momentum is associated with rising CFROI forecasts and \nstrong relative stock price appreciation. \n \uf402\n Valuation reflects the gap between the current stock price and the warranted value in the HOLT\u00ae \nvaluation model. Valuation also incorporates adjusted measures of price-to-earnings and price-to-book \nratios. Together, these metrics help assess whether a stock is relatively cheap or expensive.  \n \uf402\n Quality captures the company\u2019s level of achieved CFROI and whether the company has been able to \nconsistently make investments that create value. Firms with high CFROIs and strong value creation score \nwell on quality. \n \nThe upside of adding refinements is that you can find a base rate that closely matches the case you are \nconsidering. The downside is that the sample size (N) shrinks with each refinement. We have tried to maintain \nhealthy sample sizes even in the end branches, and we display the Ns along the way so that you can assess \nthe trade-off between fit and prior occurrences. \n \n                                                 \n \n\uf02a CFROI\n\u00ae is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding the United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse \nGroup AG or its affiliates. \nDays\nDays\n-30\nEvent\nN =\n+30\n+60\n+90\n-30\nEvent\nN =\n+30\n+60\n+90\nEarnings\n-3.3%\n14.5%\n1,505\n2.7% 3.7% 4.1%\nFull Sample \n-5.9%\n13.8%\n6,797\n3.5% 6.1% 7.0%\nNon-Earnings\n-6.6%\n13.6%\n5,292\n3.8% 6.8% 7.9%\nDays\nDays\n"

All of our \nsummary exhibits show the average, or mean, abnormal shareholder return. That average represents a full \ndistribution of results. For most of the distributions, the median return, the return that separates the top half \nfrom the bottom half of the sample, is less than the mean, which tells you that the distributions are skewed to \nthe right.  \n \nFurther, the standard deviations of most of the distributions are in the range of 30-45 percent. While our \nsummary figures show a tidy average, recognize that the figure belies a rich distribution. Appendix B shows \nthe distributions for a handful of events. The base rate data can be extremely helpful in making a sound \ndecision even if the outcome is probabilistic.  \n \nWe\u2019re now ready to turn to the checklist and the base rates. \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 11, 2016 \n \nCelebrating the Summit \n6 \nThe Checklist \n \nYou come into the office and one of the stocks in your portfolio is up 10 percent or more relative to the S&P \n500. The move is unrelated to announced M&A. Here\u2019s what you do: \n \uf403\n Earnings or non-earnings. Determine whether the precipitating announcement is an earnings release or \na non-earnings disclosure and go to the appropriate exhibit;  \n \uf403\n Momentum. Check the appropriate HOLT Lens\u2122 page to determine if the stock had strong, weak, or \nneutral momentum going into the announcement. You can either go to the momentum section of the exhibit \nor continue;   \n \uf403 \nValuation. Check to see if the valuation is cheap, expensive, or neutral. You can either go to the section in \nthe exhibit that combines momentum and valuation or continue;   \n \uf403\n Quality. Check to see if the quality is high, low, or neutral. Go to section in the exhibit that incorporates all \nof the factors.  \n \nWe have two detailed case studies that we\u2019ll present in a moment, but let\u2019s run through an example to see \nhow this works. The first item is to determine whether the announcement was a scheduled earnings release or \nnot. Let\u2019s say it was an earnings event. That means we would refer to the data in exhibit 3. \n \nStep two is to assess the momentum. We\u2019ll assume that momentum is weak. If you look at the left side of the \nexhibit you\u2019ll see the section that reflects momentum. If you focus on the results of the companies with weak \nmomentum, you\u2019ll see a few figures. You\u2019ll notice that the 665 stocks in that reference class increased 15.2 \npercent, on average, the day of the event. You will also see that those stocks greatly underperformed the \nmarket, with a cumulative abnormal return of -5.7 percent in the prior 30 trading days.  \n \nYou\u2019ll also see that the stocks in that class did well in the subsequent period, with cumulative abnormal returns \nof 4.1 percent in the next 30 trading days, 4.7 percent in 60 trading days, and 5.2 percent in 90 trading days. \nWe selected 90 trading days as the extent of this analysis because we felt it is a sufficient amount of time for \nan investment team to thoroughly reassess the stock\u2019s merit. We designed the READ-DO checklist to provide \nimmediate guidance.  \n \nWe now turn to valuation, which you can find in the middle of the exhibit, to see if we can sharpen the analysis. \nLet\u2019s assume the valuation was expensive. If we look 60 days out, we see that the 164 instances in this \ngroup have an average cumulative abnormal return of 5.7 percent.    \n \nAs a final check, we consider quality, which you can find on the right of the exhibit. Let\u2019s say quality is low. \nWe\u2019ve now shrunk our sample size to 72, and see that the 60-day cumulative abnormal return is 12.6 percent.    \n"

The stock rose 10.7 percent that day, from $58.62 to $64.90. The \nS&P 500 was down 0.4 percent. This was a non-earnings event. \n \nSince we use cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for all of the stock performance data, it is worth taking a \nmoment to explain how we do the calculation. We determine daily abnormal return using a simplified market \nmodel, which compares the actual return of a stock to its expected return. The expected return equals the \ntotal shareholder return of the benchmark, the S&P 500, times the stock\u2019s beta. The abnormal return is the \ndifference between the actual return and the expected return. \n \nWe calculate beta by doing a regression analysis with the S&P 500\u2019s total returns as the independent variable \n(x-axis) and Harman\u2019s total returns as the dependent variable (y-axis). We use monthly total returns for the \nprior 60 months. Beta is the slope of the best-fit line. Exhibit 5 shows that the beta for Harman for the 60 \nmonths ended July 2013 was 2.2. This is the beta we use for our calculations of daily abnormal returns during \nthe month of August 2013. Similarly, the beta for September 2013 would use returns for the 60 months \nended August 2013. \n \nExhibit 5: Beta Calculation for Harman \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \n \n \ny = 2.21x + 0.00\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nHarman International Industries\nS&P 500\nMonthly Returns\nAugust 2008 - July 2013\n"

      "text": " \nJanuary 11, 2016 \n \nCelebrating the Summit \n16 \nSummary \n \nThe goal of this analysis is to provide you with useful base rates in the case that you see a sharp gain in one \nof the stocks in your portfolio. Mountain climbers run a risk of \u201ccelebrating the summit,\u201d enjoying the pleasure \nwithout considering the rest of the journey. Likewise, investors should not bask in their success but rather \nconsider their next action. \n \nThe base rates in this report offer guidance in determining whether you should buy, sell, or do nothing in the \ndays following the event. You should keep this report handy, and when an event occurs you can pull it out and \nfollow the steps in the checklist. The results contained here are a useful complement to fundamental analysis.   \n \nBecause these events tend to be infrequent, most investors don\u2019t have a systematic approach, or data, to \nmake a sound judgment. Further, large price increases almost always evoke a strong emotional reaction, \nwhich complicates the process of decision making even more.   \n \nOur examination of exhibits 3 and 4 suggests that the following characteristics are consistent with buy and sell \nsignals: \n \nBuy. For earnings releases, there is a clear and convincing buy signal for stocks with weak or neutral \nmomentum prior to the event. This buy signal is strengthened if the stock has a cheap or neutral valuation.  \n \nThe buy signal for stocks with weak momentum is even more pronounced for non-earnings events than it is \nfor earnings releases. This signal is stronger for stocks that have a cheap valuation, and is further amplified if \nthe companies are of high or neutral quality, although the returns for low quality are still very high. Harman, \nthe subject of our first case study, was a non-earnings event with weak momentum, cheap valuation, and low \nquality, and hence the data suggested a buy. \n \nSell. For earnings releases, momentum alone does not indicate a strong buy or sell pattern. But there is a \nfairly strong sell signal for stocks that have the combination of strong momentum and expensive valuation. The \nsell signal holds for stocks with strong momentum, expensive valuation, and high or neutral quality. W.W. \nGrainger, our second case, had strong momentum, expensive valuation, and high quality\u2014factors that \nsuggested selling the shares.  \n \nFor non-earnings events, the cumulative abnormal returns following an event are largely positive. But we must \nnote that these stocks as a group performed poorly prior to the event, down nearly seven percentage points \nrelative to the market. There are a couple of combinations that suggest selling the stock. The strongest sell \nsignal is for companies that combine strong momentum and expensive valuation. That signal is further \namplified if the companies are of high or neutral quality. \n \nMaking decisions in the face of uncertainty is always a challenge, but it is inherent to investing. Deciding what \nto do with a stock following a sharp increase is particularly difficult because emotions tend to run high after \nthese events. This report provides grounding in the form of base rates in an effort to better inform decision \nmaking. \n"

Stocks that score well have rising levels of \nexpected CFROI as the result of upward earnings revisions; positive stock price momentum; and good \nliquidity.  \uf402\n CFROI Key Momentum, 13-week (60%) - CFROI Key Momentum measures change in the level of \nexpected CFROI following revisions in consensus earnings per share estimates.  \uf402\n Price Momentum (52-week) (30%) - Price Momentum is based on the percentage change in \nmarket value over the past 52 weeks.  \uf402\n Daily Liquidity Average (10%) - Daily Liquidity Average reflects the number of shares traded in the \nlast quarter, divided by 63 trading days, multiplied by the stock price at the end of the most recent \nweek, divided by market capitalization.  \n \nValuation: Valuation assesses the difference between the stock\u2019s warranted value, based on the HOLT \nframework\u00ae, and the stock\u2019s current market price. Stocks with the most upside are cheap, and those with the \nleast upside, or downside, are expensive.  \uf402\n Percentage Change to Best Price (50%) - Percentage Change to Best Price measures the \ndifference between HOLT\u2019s warranted value and the current stock price. By using a discounted cash \nflow approach that standardizes financial figures, the HOLT model generates values that allow for the \ncomparison of firms across regions, sectors, and accounting standards.  \uf402\n Economic P/E (30%) \u2013 Economic P/E is HOLT\u2019s version of a price-to-earnings ratio. You can \ncompare Economic P/E across companies and industries because the value-to-cost ratio is divided by \nCFROI, normalizing results. Specifically, Economic P/E = (Enterprise Value / Inflation Adjusted Net \nAssets) / CFROI  \uf402\n Value-to-Cost Ratio (10%) \u2013 Value-to-Cost Ratio is analogous to price/book value, but reflects a \nnumber of adjustments that reduce volatility and better reflect firm value. These include inflation \nadjustments for old plant and inventory in gross investment, capitalized research and development \n(R&D), capitalized operating leases, the reflection of the contingent claim for stock options in debt, \npension debt, preferred stock, and liabilities related to capitalized operating leases. The Value-to-Cost \nRatio = (Market Value of Equity + Minority Interest + HOLT Debt) / Inflation Adjusted Net Assets  \uf402\n Dividend Yield (10%) \u2013 Dividend Yield is the dividends paid in the last 12 months divided by the \nmost recent share price.  \n \nQuality: Quality measures a company\u2019s record of generating cash and managing growth, independent of \nexpectations about the future. Firms that score well have high CFROIs and have shown the ability to grow \nprofitable businesses or the willingness to shrink unprofitable ones.  \uf402\n CFROI Last Fiscal Year (50%) - CFROI Last Fiscal Year is the ratio of gross cash flow to gross \ninvestment and is expressed as an internal rate of return. We use the CFROI for the last reported \nfiscal year.  \uf402\n Managing for Value (30%) - Managing for Value equals the spread between CFROI and the \nDiscount Rate, multiplied by the inflation-adjusted gross investment. This allows us to determine \nwhether the company\u2019s growth creates value and is sustainable. Growth in businesses that earn a \n"

A positive value indicates that the company either \nincreased the spread between CFROI and the discount rate, or grew in a business with a positive \nspread. Change in Value Creation = (CFROI \u2013 Discount Rate * Growth Rate) \u2013 Prior Fiscal Year \nSpread. \n \nOnce on HOLT Lens, you can find the scores on the homepage of each company by clicking on \u201cScorecard \nPercentile.\u201d To best align with the base rates, which reflect factor scores from before the event, it is \nappropriate to use the Scorecard on the day of the gain as opposed to the days afterwards. On the day of the \njump, the factors do not yet incorporate that price movement\u2014HOLT makes those adjustments overnight.   \n \nYou can also see the company\u2019s factor scores from prior to the event by selecting \u201cMore Information\u201d from \nwithin the \u201cScorecard Percentile\u201d page. You will see a screen similar to exhibit 13. This screen shows the \nfactor scores from the end of the most recent month prior to the event. For instance, the date of the event for \nHarman was August 8, 2013, so here we show the factor scores for Harman as of July 31, 2013. \n \nExhibit 13: Detailed Breakdown of Harman\u2019s Factor Scores \n \nSource: HOLT Lens. \n \n \n \nHOLT Scorecard Metholdology Calculated July 31, 2013\nEnter Ticker:\nInvestment Style: Value Trap\nRanked #94 of 146 within Consumer Discretionary peers in North America\nUsing Region Relative Scorecard\nMomentum\nValue\nPercentile Weight\nValue\nWeight\nValue\nCFROI Revisions (13Wk)\n-0.3\n16\n60%\nMomentum\n35\n33%\nOverall\n45\nPrice Momentum (52Wk)\n36.9\n61\n30%\nPercentile\n23%\n30\nPercentile\n69%\n38\nSize Relative Daily Liq.

These distributions \nreflect non-earnings announcements and contain all events, including the bubble periods. We also provide \nsome statistical properties for each distribution, including the sample size, mean, median, and standard \ndeviation. \n \nExhibit 14 shows all the cases with weak momentum and displays five distributions of cumulative abnormal \nreturns, including the 30 trading days prior to the event, the day of the event itself, and the 30, 60, and 90 \ntrading days subsequent to the event. This is the first branch of the Harman case study. \n \nExhibit 15 shows weak momentum and cheap valuation, which trims the sample size by more than one-half. \nHere again we include the 30 trading days prior to the event, the day of the event itself, and the 30, 60, and \n90 trading days after the event. This is the second branch of the Harman case study. \n \nExhibit 16 shows the final branch in the Harman case study: weak momentum, cheap valuation, and low \nquality.

It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary quantitative \nalgorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all the companies included \nin its database. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default variables and incorporated into the \nalgorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and earnings data provided by outside data vendors are \nsubject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying economics of firm performance. These adjustments provide \nconsistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies across industries or national borders. The default scenario that is \nproduced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline valuation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce \nalternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request. \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation \nmodel establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default variables may also \nbe adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on \nrequest. \n\u00a9 2016 CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved \n \n"
