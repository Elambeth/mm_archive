The idea is \nthat when you evaluate a choice you should consider the cost of \npassing on the next best alternative. Those who invest in equity \nmutual funds that are actively managed almost always have the \noption to put money into an equity index fund that provides broad \nmarket exposure at a relatively low expense. In fact, the Securities \nand Exchange Commission requires managers of mutual funds in \nthe U.S. to report their results along with an \u201cappropriate broad-\nbased securities market index\u201d as a benchmark.1 \nThe S&P 500, an index of approximately 500 U.S. stocks with \nlarge capitalizations that make up about 80 percent of the total \nstock market, is by far the most popular benchmark for U.S. equity \nfunds. Just as a sports team might scout a competitor before a big \ngame, an active manager can examine the S&P 500 to assess its \nstrategy. The goal is to beat the benchmark. \nAn index committee constructs the S&P 500.2 The committee \ntends to follow some criteria but there are no hard and fast rules.3 \nFor example, companies currently eligible for inclusion should \nhave a market capitalization of at least $18 billion (with a sufficient \namount that trades freely), have been profitable in the most recent \nquarter and cumulatively profitable over the past four quarters, \nand maintain sector representation consistent with the total \nmarket. On average, there are about 25 changes in the S&P 500 \nannually, or about 5 percent of the total number of stocks. One \nremoval and addition to the index constitutes a single change.4  \nMore notable than what the index committee does is what it does \nnot do. There are no macroeconomic forecasts, sector or industry \nlimits, position weightings, factor analyses, or performance \nexpectations. The index has low turnover and invests for the long \nterm. A high percentage of equity funds that invest in large \ncapitalization stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 over the \npast decade.5 But the facts about active management are not as \ndire as some headlines proclaim, and manager skill exists.6 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Stock market concentration measures how much of the \noverall market capitalization is in a small number of stocks.  \nIn the decade ended in 2023, the concentration of the U.S. stock market, measured as the weighting of the top \n10 stocks, nearly doubled from 14 to 27 percent. This means that a limited number of stocks have played a large \nrole in the market\u2019s total return. For example, the appreciation of seven stocks, dubbed the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d \nwere responsible for more than one-half of the S&P 500\u2019s gain of 26.3 percent in 2023.8  \nThis has led to a lot of discussion in the investment community. Topics include the challenge of beating the \nbenchmark when so few stocks drive results, worries about the loss of diversification, speculation about whether \nthe stock market is in a bubble, and fears that the inflows into index funds and other rules-based strategies have \ncontributed to the mindless bidding up of a handful of stocks. Some of these concerns are groundless.9 But it is \nhard to produce excess returns relative to an index that has a small number of stocks making an outsized \ndifference in the overall results.    \nWe review four topics in this report. First, we look at concentration over the past three-quarters of a century to \nsee where we stand today. We also examine which companies have the largest stock market capitalizations and \nhow that population has changed. Next, we ask whether there is a correct level of concentration, both by \ncomparing the U.S. to other global markets and by presenting the possibility that concentration was too low in \nthe past. We then seek to determine whether fundamental corporate performance supports the current increase \nin concentration. Finally, we reflect on what this development means for active equity managers. \nStock Market Concentration Since 1950 \nExhibit 1 shows stock market concentration in the U.S., measured as the market capitalization of the top 1, 3, \nand 10 companies relative to total capitalization, from 1950 to 2023. Concentration at the end of 2023 was 27 \npercent, approaching the prior peak of 30 percent in 1963. The lowest concentration over this time was 12 \npercent in 1993, and the level was 14 percent as recently as 2014. \nThe MSCI All Country World Index, which includes mid and large capitalization stocks in 23 developed and 24 \nemerging economies and covers about 85 percent of the global investable equity universe, shows a similar \npattern. The top 10 stocks in that index were about 19 percent of the total capitalization at the end of 2023, more \nthan double the level ten years earlier. This result is not altogether surprising as U.S. companies were 9 of the \n10 constituents on December 30, 2023.10  \nConcentration continued to increase in early 2024. As of the end of the first quarter, concentration was 28 percent \nin the U.S. and 20 percent for the MSCI All Country World Index. \n \n \n \n \n"

That noted, what feels disconcerting to many \ninvestors is that the rate of increase in concentration in the last decade is the most rapid since 1950.  \nExhibit 2 shows the stocks of the companies that have been among the top three in market capitalization at the \nend of the year from 1950 to 2023. Remarkably, just 17 are on the list, only 11 stocks have held a spot in the \ntop 3 for more than two years, and 4 have fleetingly been number one at some point during a year but failed to \nhold the top position at the year\u2019s conclusion.13 This is from a population of about 28,000 stocks that have been \nlisted at any time since 1950.14 Companies that are in one of the top positions most frequently over this period \ninclude ExxonMobil (47 years), AT&T (39), IBM (28), General Electric (23), and Microsoft (22).

Nvidia, a computing infrastructure company that has \nbenefitted from the increase in spending on artificial intelligence, reached the top 3 in early 2024. \nHendrik Bessembinder, a professor of finance, calculated that the total wealth creation for the stocks of all U.S. \npublic companies was $55.1 trillion from 1926 to 2022.15 A stock had to generate a return in excess of U.S. \nTreasury bills to create wealth.

In other words, can we estimate the \n\u201cright\u201d level of concentration? \nOne place to start is to look at equity markets outside of the U.S. Exhibit 3 shows the market concentration at \nthe end of 2023 for a dozen of the largest markets around the world. The U.S. is the fourth most diversified \nmarket notwithstanding the recent increase in concentration. However, since the U.S. was approximately 60 \npercent of the total equity market capitalization in 2023, changes in the composition of the U.S. have an outsized \nimpact on the aggregate as measured by indices such as the MSCI All Country World Index. \nOne study of 47 equity markets from 1989 to 2011 found that the average weighting of the top 10 positions was \n48 percent.16 In 2001, Finland and Switzerland had concentrations in excess of 80 percent.

Stock \nmarket concentrations are generally much higher outside than inside the U.S., but the U.S. makes up a majority \nof the total capitalization in the world. Further, the possibility that large capitalization stocks were mispriced a \ndecade ago, allowing them to deliver very high total shareholder returns through 2023, suggests that \nconcentration may have been too low.  \nAnother approach is to see if the underlying fundamentals support the shift in concentration over time. We want \nto know if the change in market capitalization of the leading companies is backed by value creation. \nFundamentals and Concentration  \nThe most basic way to think about stock market concentration is to consider the distribution of value creation. \nIndividual companies commonly see their value creation prospects improve and worsen during their lifetimes. \nStock prices tend to reflect expectations about future value creation. \nStock market concentration may be justified if the market capitalizations mirror the value creation prospects. \nEconomic profit is one way to measure the magnitude of value creation. Economic profit equals return on \ninvested capital (ROIC) minus the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) times invested capital [Economic \nProfit = (ROIC \u2013 WACC) \u00d7 Invested Capital]. For example, the economic profit of a company that has an ROIC \nof 13 percent, a WACC of 8 percent, and invested capital of $1,000 would be $50 [(0.13 \u2013 0.08) \u00d7 $1,000 = $50]. \nNote that economic profit measures not only value creation (the difference between ROIC and WACC) but also \nthe size of the opportunity via invested capital. More concretely, the spread between ROIC and WACC provides \na sense of the appropriate multiple of enterprise value to invested capital.19 That multiple times invested capital \noffers an estimate of enterprise value, from which it is straightforward to calculate equity market capitalization. \nThere is a reasonably direct link between economic profit and equity market capitalization. \nExhibit 5 shows the economic profit of the top 10 companies by market capitalization and of the rest of the \nuniverse. Our calculations of ROIC and invested capital include adjustments for intangible investments.20 In \n2023, we estimate that the aggregate economic profit for the U.S. public companies in our universe was $481 \nbillion, and that the top 10 companies by market capitalization contributed $331 billion to that total. The top 10 \nstocks at the end of 2023 were 27 percent of the market capitalization and the companies earned 69 percent of \nthe economic profit.  \n"

The S&P 500\u2019s \ncompound annual TSR over the full period was 11.4 percent.  \nThe market\u2019s runup in the mid to late 1990s and subsequent correction from 2000 to 2013 were extraordinary. \nThe top 3 stocks at the end of 1999, Microsoft, General Electric, and Cisco, embedded extremely high \nexpectations. As a crude proxy for that optimism, the price-earnings (P/E) multiple based on consensus earnings \nestimates for the next 12 months was 65 for Microsoft, 42 for General Electric, and 97 for Cisco. From the \nbeginning of January 2000 to the trough in concentration at the end of 2013, the compound annual TSR was -\n1.0 percent for Microsoft, -1.4 percent for General Electric, and -5.6 percent for Cisco. \nThe top 3 at the end of 2023 had substantially more modest P/Es, with Apple at 29, Microsoft at 31, and Alphabet \nat 21. Those multiples are above the average of S&P 500 stocks, but the economic returns for the businesses \nare also above the average. \nExhibit 9: S&P 500 Annual Returns During Rising and Falling Concentration, 1950-2023 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nTo investigate how the shareholders of the top companies fared over time, we created an index of the TSR \nrelative to the S&P 500 for each of the largest three stocks starting at the end of 1950. The index is set at 100 \nfor the individual spots and changes annually based on the relative TSRs of the stocks in the positions at the \nend of the prior year. \nExhibit 10 shows the results. Two findings are noteworthy. First, the top stock has historically been a bad \ninvestment. Specifically, the arithmetic average of the series of annual returns of the top stock relative to the \nS&P 500 from 1950 to 2023 was -1.9 percent. The geometric return of the series was -4.3 percent, reflecting the \nfact that the series was volatile. That the top stock delivers poor results is consistent with past research.25 \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n1950\n1952\n1954\n1956\n1958\n1960\n1962\n1964\n1966\n1968\n1970\n1972\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\n2022\nWeighting of Top 10 Stocks (Percent)\n12.0%\n16.4%\n10.5%\n23.5%\n3.6%\nRising Concentration\nFalling Concentration\nS&P 500 Annualized TSR During Periods of:\n"

The index for the second largest stock \nhad an average arithmetic return of 2.6 percent and a geometric return of 0.8 percent. This series was also \nvolatile, but not as volatile as that of the number one stock. Likewise, the third largest stock did well, with an \narithmetic return of 1.6 percent and a geometric return of 0.3 percent.

This is notwithstanding the swoon in large cap \ntechnology stocks in 2022. The arithmetic average annual excess return was 15.9 percentage points for owning \nthe largest stock, 9.8 percentage points for the second largest stock, and 8.4 percentage points for the third \nlargest stock over this time.

That trees do not grow to the sky, an acknowledgement that there is a limit to growth and size, \nwould suggest caution. A focus on the strong fundamental results for these companies and the argument that \nnew technologies, such as artificial intelligence, may disproportionately benefit the larger firms would support a \nmore constructive view.   \nConclusion \nInvestors in equity mutual funds that are actively managed generally have an alternative. They can allocate \ncapital to diversified index funds. Because of this, active managers seek to generate returns in excess of the \nbenchmark. As a result, index fund returns and the manner in which the index achieves them are both relevant. \nReturns for index funds are not the result of macroeconomic forecasts, factor analyses, or overweighting sectors, \nindustries, or positions. Indices do periodically rebalance but for the most part the committees let the chips fall \nwhere they may.   \nThe last decade has seen a sharp increase in stock market concentration, which captures the percentage of the \noverall market capitalization that is in a small number of stocks. This is of practical concern because active \nmanagers, who typically construct portfolios with average market capitalizations that are smaller than those of \ntheir benchmarks, struggle to generate excess returns when concentration is on the rise. For instance, 30 \npercent of U.S. mutual funds outperformed their benchmarks on average in each year from 1960 to 2023 when \nconcentration was rising, and 47 percent outperformed when concentration was falling.  \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nRelative Total Shareholder Return (Index=100)\n#1\n#2\n#3\n"

Some of these \nconcerns are difficult to quantify. \nNot many stocks have been among the leaders in market capitalization. Just 11 stocks have spent more than \ntwo years in a spot among the top 3 since 1950. Nine of these 11 companies appear on the list of the greatest \nwealth creators in the U.S. stock market since 1926. \nIt is reasonable to ask whether stock market concentration in the U.S. is too high today or whether it was too \nlow in the past. The U.S. stock market, even after a decade of increasing concentration, remains one of the \nmore diversified markets in the world. But the U.S. has an outsized impact on global indices such as the MSCI \nAll Country World Index because it represents about 60 percent of the capitalization of all equity markets. \nWe can calculate what concentration would have looked like in the past had today\u2019s leaders in market \ncapitalization earned a market rate of return over the past 5 and 10 years. This simple analysis, which assumes \nthat stocks are properly priced today and were mispriced in the past, shows that the theoretical concentration \nwas higher than the actual concentration.  \nFundamental results can justify rising concentration. From 2014 to 2023, the top 10 stocks were 19 percent of \nthe market capitalization, on average, while the companies made up 47 percent of the total economic profit. In \n2023, the top 10 equities were 27 percent of the market capitalization and the firms contributed 69 percent to \nthe total economic profit. The relative market capitalizations of the stocks of these companies is not without a \nfundamental foundation. \nThe S&P 500 has delivered returns above the average when concentration was rising and below the average \nwhen concentration was falling. The results were pronounced for the concentration changes associated with the \ninflating and deflating of the dot-com bubble, with compound annual returns of 23.5 percent from 1994 through \n1999 and just 3.6 percent from 2000 to 2013. The largest stocks at the apex in 1999 traded at very high multiples \nof earnings and cash flow. The top stocks today are at a premium to the overall market but also represent \ncompanies with solid ROICs and growth prospects. \nOwning the stock of the largest company has historically been a poor investment relative to the market overall \nuntil about a decade ago. Owning the second and third largest stocks produced excess returns from 1950 to \n2023. However, all three of the top stocks have provided stellar relative returns from 2014 to 2023. Where we \ngo from here is anyone\u2019s guess, but assessments of sustainable competitive advantage and growth will be \ncentral to determining that path. \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 16-18 \n \n \n"

First is that the market was efficient at the end of 2023 \nand inefficient 5 or 10 years prior. Stock prices reflect expectations about future financial results, and total returns \nover time ultimately capture changes in expectations. (Dividends also play a role, but typically a much smaller \none). One could argue that the stocks were priced efficiently in the prior period and are overpriced today. There \nis no simple way to resolve this conundrum. Second, we discount the market capitalizations using the return of \nthe Russell 3000. The beta, which measures the return of an individual security relative to the return on the \nmarket index, for most of these companies was in excess of 1.0. This means that they were on average riskier \nthan the market and that our discount rate was too low. \n19 Michael J.

We then divide that \npopulation in two based on market capitalization at the end of each calendar year, with the largest one-third \ndeemed to be large cap and the smaller two-thirds small cap.
