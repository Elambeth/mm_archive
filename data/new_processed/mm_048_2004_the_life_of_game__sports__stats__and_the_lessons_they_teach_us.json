Sports capture everyday issues like discipline and disorder, \nplanning and improvisation, cooperation and competition, skill and luck. Combine these with big money in \nprofessional sports, and it\u2019s no wonder the newspapers and airwaves are filled with who\u2019s hot and who\u2019s not. \nBut when trying to evaluate individual and team performance, sports team managers and pundits face a \nfundamental question: what\u2019s more reliable, quantitative statistics or qualitative intuition? While the right answer \nlies somewhere between the extremes, many in sports have a hard time striking an optimal balance. \nIn June 2004, the Santa Fe Institute hosted a one-day conference directly addressing the above question. While \nthe discussion was ostensibly about sports, many of the frameworks and conclusions relate directly to business \nand investing. \nWhat You See versus What\u2019s Happening \nMost players, coaches, and fans evaluate games using perception and past practice. By and large, intuition and \ntradition assume a larger role than statistics in shaping sports measurement, management, strategy, and play. \nHowever, there may be a difference between what we see when we watch a game and what is going on. To \nillustrate this point, economist Colin Camerer projected an image that flickered between two nearly identical \nscenes and asked the participants to spot the difference.2 Many couldn\u2019t within the time allowed, even though \nthe difference was clear once Camerer pointed it out. \nThe message: we don\u2019t always perceive all that\u2019s going on in a scene. Statistics may help us by providing ways \nto understand a game or situation that our intuition or perception may not capture. \nMichael Lewis\u2019s bestseller, Moneyball, drilled home this point and created a stir in the sports and business \nworlds when it showed how the low-budget Oakland Athletics fielded very competitive teams by using statistics \nmore effectively than their rivals. The A\u2019s relied not only on the \u201ctools\u201d that baseball traditionally prized (ability to \nhit, hit for power, throw, run, and field) but also on skills\u2014the ability to get the job done. As a result, players that \nlooked statistically attractive but didn\u2019t fit the ideal player mold were relatively cheap. Like good value investors, \nthe A\u2019s scooped up a portfolio of undervalued players and won as many games as many big market teams at a \nfraction of the cost. \nBC and CB (Bowl Championship and Colonel Blotto) \nThe conference\u2019s first session was about ranking teams. Owners, fans, coaches, and players all have an interest \nin determining which team is \u201cbest.\u201d Standings and tournaments are two ways to answer the question. Yet both \nspeakers concluded that team ranking is extremely difficult and potentially very misleading. Many of these \nlessons apply to the business world\u2014especially in markets for goods and services. \nMathematician Ken Massey opened by discussing challenges associated with ranking teams. Massey should \nknow; his Massey Ratings form part of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Rankings that determine which \ncollege football teams will play in key bowl games. (See http://www.masseyratings.com/.) \nRating systems attempt to objectively measure each team\u2019s performance relative to the schedule it faces. They \ndiffer from polls, standings, or point systems. Massey noted a number of hurdles in creating rating systems, \nincluding: \n\u2022 \nA lack of transitivity. Just because team A beats team B, and team B beats team C, doesn\u2019t mean that \nteam A will beat team C. (See Exhibit 1.) \n\u2022 \nDisparate schedules. The rankings must compare teams playing very different schedules. Comparing \na losing team with a strong schedule to a winning team with a weak schedule is difficult. \n\u2022 \nNoise. Lots of factors come into play that shape a team\u2019s performance versus its potential. These \ninclude the environment (venue, weather, crowd), physical (injuries, travel, elevation), and luck. \n \n"

Used by permission. \nMassey reviewed a number of mathematical techniques to rank teams, including a least squares, maximum \nlikelihood, and Markov chains. While Massey ratings are designed to measure past performance, they also have \npredictive value. Massey noted that his best maximum likelihood model correctly predicts the outcome of roughly \nthree-quarters of pro baseball games and about two-thirds of NFL games. \nUniversity of Michigan social scientist Scott Page opened his talk by challenging three widely held premises: \nthere is a best team; you can rank teams; and settling it on the field is better than looking at statistics. \nThe issue of multi-dimensionality creates the main problem when determining the best team. Teams are stronger \nor weaker across a range of performance variables, or dimensions. Examples of performance variables in \nfootball include running offense, running defense, and special teams. Since teams of similar ability have different \nstrengths across performance variables, the problem of determining which team is better is difficult. Page \nsuggested the problem looks like the rock, paper, and scissors game. \nPage introduced the group to Colonel Blotto, a two-player competitive game model. Here\u2019s a simple version: \n\u2022 \nBoth players get 100 playing pieces \n\u2022 \nThere are three locations to place the pieces \n\u2022 \nThe player who places the most pieces on a location wins that location \n\u2022 \nThe player who wins the most locations wins the game \nHere\u2019s an illustration: \n \n \n \n \nL1 \nL2 \nL3 \nPlayer 1 \n \n \n42 \n32 \n26 \nPlayer 2 \n \n \n21 \n34 \n45 \nPlayer 2 wins two to one. \n"

Given these rules, one can choose some \nreally bad strategies (100, 0,0\u2014akin to having a great quarterback with no offensive line) but by-and-large \nwinning is random if two teams have similar abilities. (See Exhibit 2. 3)  Even if teams have uneven ability, it often \ntakes a lot more ability to make a difference. \nExhibit 2: Colonel Blotto\u2019s Pinwheel: When Ability is Similar, Winning is Random \n2\n3\n1\nWinning is a random process\nSuboptimal strategy\n2\n3\n1\nWinning is a random process\nSuboptimal strategy\n \nSource: Scott E. Page,  \u201cOn the Possibility of Value in Sports\u201d, Presented at A Complex Look at Sports Conference, June 17, 2004. Used by permission. \nThe more dimensions a game has, the less predictable it becomes. We should expect (and see) more upsets in \nhigh dimension games like football than in low dimension games like tennis and wrestling. No surprise then that \nthe betting line, which reflects the experience and intuitions of bettors, often doesn\u2019t match the computer \nrankings. Bettors may be able to aggregate dimensions better than the ranking models or polls can. \nPage then discussed what he calls \u201cthe general manager\u2019s backpack\u201d problem. General managers have to put \ntogether a team of players with varying dimensions within a finite (except for the Yankees) budget. This problem \nis extremely hard to solve, especially when the solution relies to some degree on what other teams are doing. \nParadoxically, Page noted that if you add complexity\u2014for example, make the strength of one dimension \ncontingent on another\u2014the problem becomes simpler. To illustrate, the ability to run the fast break in basketball \nis more valuable with good defensive rebounding. Skillful general managers select teams to take advantage of \nthese contingencies. This line of thinking might help explain why the Detroit Pistons \u201cupset\u201d the heavily favored \nLos Angeles Lakers in the 2004 NBA championship. \nGo For It \nThe next pair of speakers, Cal Berkeley economist David Romer and USC football\u2019s offensive coordinator Norm \nChow, discussed football play calling in general and kicking strategy in particular. This pair offered the clearest \ndichotomy between statistics-driven theory and intuition-and-habit-driven practice. \nRomer\u2019s paper, \u201cIt\u2019s Fourth Down and What Does the Bellman Equation Say?\u201d, analyzes pro football play \nselection.4 His data come from all NFL games in the 1998-2000 seasons, and provide expected points for \nvarious positions on the field and down situations. Romer\u2019s analysis shows that NFL coaches call plays too \nconservatively: they don\u2019t go for first downs frequently enough and too often settle for field goals when they \nshould attempt to score a touchdown. 5 Exhibit 3 summarizes Romer\u2019s findings and recommendations. \n \n"

Used by permission. \nFor example, of the 532 fourth downs in the offense\u2019s half of the field where Romer\u2019s analysis suggests going for it, \nteams only went for it eight times. In the 183 fourth downs with five or more yards to go where the analysis \nindicates teams should go for it, they did so only 13 times. Romer notes that this sub optimal play calling might \ncost NFL teams one game per year. \nPlayers, coaches, and fans often find Romer\u2019s work objectionable, pointing to factors like momentum, third versus \nfourth down plays, and selection bias (the data are true only for average teams). Romer addresses these concerns \nhead on, making a case that the objections are either weak or invalid. \nTake the issue of momentum. Convention holds that if a team stops its opponent\u2019s fourth-down attempt, it gains an \nenergy and emotional edge. Romer\u2019s skepticism about this stems from two sources. First, while the analysis \ndoesn\u2019t take into account the deflating downside of a fourth down failure, it also doesn\u2019t incorporate the lift from a \nsuccessful fourth down play. Second, other studies of momentum found weak evidence for momentum effects in \nthe data. Said differently, statistics reflect emotion. \nIn stark contrast to Romer, coach Chow emphasized the role of emotion. He clearly believes in momentum and \nstreaks, notwithstanding that both Romer\u2019s analysis and a substantial body of evidence suggest sports outcomes \nare generally consistent with probabilities. 6 \nChow also underscored the risk aversion inherent in sports. Coaches generally eschew new strategies because \nthey don\u2019t want to lose\u2014at least not in an unconventional fashion. What John Maynard Keynes said about \ninvesting applies to sports: \u201cworldly wisdom teaches that it is better for the reputation to fail conventionally than to \nsucceed unconventionally.\u201d  \nChow\u2019s take on statistical analysis brought Camerer\u2019s point about perception into sharp focus.  The approach most \ncoaches use is reminiscent of Fisher Black\u2019s famous 1986 paper \u201cNoise\u201d discussing how investors operate: 7 \nBecause there is so much noise in the world, people adopt rules of thumb. They share their \nrules of thumb with each other, and very few people have enough experience with interpreting \nnoisy evidence to see that the rules are too simple. \nLike many practitioners, Chow relies heavily on rules of thumb and traditional approaches. That said, Chow and \nhis teams have been very successful, so his intuition and pattern recognition skills are probably well honed.  \n"

He \nemphasized the large amount of day-to-day noise, based on factors like personal issues, media attention, \nand fan reactions, mixed in with statistics. \nWhat biases does DePodesta see? First, there are emotional biases\u2014like overemphasizing most recent \noutcomes, oversimplifying complex situations, and adherence to conventional wisdom. These biases often \nencourage poor decisions. \nSecond, he noted the short-term orientation of many organizations. For example, half of major league \nbaseball\u2019s 30 general managers have fewer than three years of tenure, eight have fewer than two years of \nservice, and only one has been at his post for more than a decade. Similarly, a slew of new coaches joined \nthe NBA in the 2003-04 season. As a result, various people might have different and conflicting time \nhorizons even within an organization. For example, a field manager with a one-year contract may seek to \nfield a squad very differently than a general manager with a five-year contract.  \nFinally, DePodesta emphasized the importance of process versus outcome in decision-making. He \nacknowledged the intense difficulty involved in avoiding this trap, but reinforced the importance of the \ndistinction in good decisions. \nBasketball and the Brain \nDean Oliver, author of Basketball on Paper, provided some insight on how to break down statistics in \nbasketball. Basketball sits between baseball (lots of one-on-one interaction) and football (eleven-on-eleven) \nin complexity, or number of dimensions. \nAs Oliver described it, basketball boils down to number of possessions and how efficiently each team \nperforms with their possessions. Taking it one step further, Oliver argues that four factors define the crucial \naspects of basketball: 8 \n1. Field goal shooting percentage \n2. Offensive rebounds \n3. Committing turnovers \n4. Going to the foul line (and making the shots) \nThis approach allows Oliver to rate teams and players. For example, he has developed a software program, \nRoboscout, to help predict game outcomes. (See http://www.82games.com/.) \nBasketball on Paper includes some analysis that applies well beyond basketball and sports. The first is \nanother take on streak data. Stephen Jay Gould said that streaks are \u201cluck imposed on skill.\u201d Oliver shows \nthis with data in Exhibit 4. Streaks fall within the realm of statistics: probability shows that the longest streaks \naccrue to the best performers (in Oliver\u2019s example, teams with higher win percentages).  \nExhibit 4: Chance of at Least One Winning Streak of the Shown Length in 82-Game Season \n \nSource: Dean Oliver, Basketball on Paper (Washington, D.C: Brassey\u2019s, Inc., 2004), 70.

Based on NBA data, Oliver shows that both losing and \nwinning teams tend to revert back to average\u2014a .500 win percentage\u2014over time. These analyses clearly \nparallel aspects of business and investing. \nExhibit 5: Five Years After: Most Teams Approach 0.500 \n \nSource: Dean Oliver, Basketball on Paper (Washington, D.C: Brassey\u2019s, Inc., 2004), 112. Copyrighted material, used by permission. \nCal Tech economist Colin Camerer gave the most eclectic talk of the day. As noted, Camerer started by \nunderscoring why statistics might help us \u201csee\u201d what\u2019s going on in sports. He then went on to document a \ncase where a sports market was inefficient, followed by a case where the sports market was efficient. \nThe inefficiency Camerer described is based on the disposition effect\u2014the notion that once we make a \nfinancial decision, we often refuse to reverse that decision until it works out. In stock market terms, the \ndisposition effect predicts that people don\u2019t sell a stock if they have a loss but rather wait to get even or post \na gain to dispose of the shares. Empirical studies of investor behavior support the theory. 9 \nCamerer and his colleagues studied whether or not the disposition effect operated for NBA draft picks. \nSpecifically, they determined whether high draft picks played more than they should based on their \ncontribution. The study confirmed that indeed high draft picks played more minutes than warranted for about \nthe first three years. Pro basketball managements are not immune to the disposition effect. \nAs an illustration of market efficiency, Camerer shared a case from horse race betting. Quite by accident, he \ndiscovered one day that bets could be cancelled. That gave him an idea: what would happen to the odds of \ntwo comparable horses if he placed a big bet on one of them and then cancelled it at the last minute? Would \ntechnical traders read the inflows and odds changes as likely asymmetric information, or would the \nfundamental bettors use the opportunity to change their betting strategy? \nCamerer selected two horses with similar, relatively low probabilities of winning. He placed a large bet on \none of them (determined via a coin toss) which he later cancelled just moments before betting closed. The \nexperiment showed that while some bettors did follow the money trail, the odds the horse would win \nimproved considerably. But after canceling the bet, he showed that the odds returned to their pre-\nmanipulation levels. Enough people bet on the other horse (a relative bargain) to offset those who tried to \ntake advantage of the perceived smart-money trend. His work demonstrates the large degree of efficiency in \npari-mutuel markets. 10 \nAnother of Camerer\u2019s topics was how many steps people tend to look ahead. General equilibrium theory \nassumes individuals have a complete understanding of their preferences for their future\u2014a clearly \nunrealistic assumption. But how far do people look out? Camerer\u2019s research shows that people tend to look \nout one or two steps\u2014and rarely more. \n"

      "text": "Page 8  \n                                    Legg Mason Capital Management \nThe Lessons \nStatistical techniques clearly factor more prominently in the world of business and investing today than they \ndid a generation ago. Perhaps sports analysis is just catching up to these other markets. But it is worth \nnoting that there are some significant challenges in intelligently using statistics in sports, business and \ninvesting. These include: \n1. Predictions help shape the outcome. In capital markets, researchers and practitioners have identified \nmany anomalies and trading strategies that delivered excess returns based on past results. But herein lies \nthe paradox\u2014in exploiting market inefficiencies, practitioners make the market more efficient. \nLikewise, if your strategy on the field (based on past statistics) becomes predictable\u2014you never bunt or you \ngo for it in certain fourth down situations\u2014and your opponent knows that, they will change their strategy to \noffset your moves. In a sense, past inefficiencies disperse, and the \u201cmarket\u201d becomes more efficient. \nIn some spheres, like weather forecasting, predictions and outcomes are independent. In markets and \nsports, there is at least the potential for significant interdependence: predictions help shape outcomes. \n2. Statistics are context dependent. To derive meaning from statistical comparisons, the data need to \nexhibit sufficient stationarity\u2014that is, the samples must be drawn from statistically similar populations. But in \nthe real world, data are often nonstationary, making comparisons perilous or even nonsensical. \nIt\u2019s pretty easy to find nonstationarity in the world of investing. Take the ubiquitous price-earnings ratio. \nPundits frequently compare today\u2019s multiple to the multiples of past periods. But significant items like \ninflation, taxes, and the composition of assets muddy these comparisons. \nIn the world of sports, it\u2019s hard to compare players across time due to changes in rules\u2014for example, \nexpansion of the lane and the shot clock in basketball\u2014or location\u2014some ball parks are more hitter or \npitcher friendly than others. Naturally we can adjust for this context dependence, but that adds another \nchallenge. \n3. The role of probability. Most of the analysis of hot hands\u2014for example, the idea that a basketball player \nwill more likely make his or her next shot after making a bucket\u2014finds that outcomes are consistent with the \nplayer\u2019s ability, or probability of success. 11 Said differently, one should expect hot hand streaks given a \nplayer\u2019s field goal percentage average. In reality, though, the vast majority of sports fans and players still \nperceive the hot hand to exist. This suggests we humans don\u2019t have a clear-cut sense of probabilities. \nWorking off probabilities is terrific if you\u2019re assured a large sample. But what if you have a limited sample \nsize? \nEconomics suggests that you still need to think probabilistically, although we now have substantial evidence \nthat humans don\u2019t make decisions this way. In fact, humans are risk adverse. This may explain why, for \nexample, NFL coaches make conservative decisions. \nAs a result of this human psychological feature (as well as others), we tend to misspecify probabilities and \noutcomes, which leads to the next challenge and opportunity. \n4. The role of psychology. Sports, business, and investing are all activities we do with others. Even though \nour understanding of psychological influences has grown measurably in recent decades\u2014Daniel Khaneman \nand Amos Tversky\u2019s seminal work in Prospect Theory played a large role in that effort\u2014we still operate in \nlargely sub optimal ways. So the final challenge and opportunity is to understand psychological factors and \nto try to use them in our favor. \nEvaluation horizon is a good example. Research shows that investors suffer from myopic loss aversion\u2014\nfrequent portfolio evaluation triggers aversion. As a result, long-term investors are willing to pay more for a \nrisky asset than short-term investors. \nYou can think of these psychological pitfalls on two levels: first, the errors we each make as individuals\u2014\noverconfidence, framing problems, etc.\u2014second, the pitfalls related to collective behavior\u2014the roles of \ninfluence and imitation. Both levels are vitally important to understand. \n"

In a very relevant article, Clayton Christensen and his \ncolleagues discuss a three-step process for theory building. 12 First, you describe what you want to \nunderstand in numbers, then you classify the phenomena into categories based on similarities, and finally \nyou build a theory that explains the behavior of the phenomena. \nOnce the theory is in place, researchers often find anomalies that force them to rethink and restate the \ndescriptions and categories. Perhaps the paper\u2019s most important message is that good theories require \nproper categorization, and as theories improve, categories typically evolve from attribute-based to \ncircumstance-based. Theories built on circumstance-based categories tell practitioners what to do in \ndifferent situations. In contrast, attribute-based categories prescribe action based on the traits of the \nphenomena. \nMost theories in business (management fads), investing (style boxes) and sports (kicking versus going for it) \nare attribute-based theories. In every case, there is room to evolve toward better, circumstance-based \nframeworks. \nSo these five issues are relevant for everyone\u2014sports people, academics, business people and investors.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n++++++++++++++++++++ \nThe views expressed in this commentary reflect those of Legg Mason Capital Management as of the date of \nthis commentary.
