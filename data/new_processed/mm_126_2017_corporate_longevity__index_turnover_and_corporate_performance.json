      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nClark Kerr, the former president of the University of California, noted that of the Western institutions \nestablished by 1520, only 85 existed almost a half millennium later. These include the Roman Catholic Church, \nthe British Parliament, several Swiss cantons, and 70 universities. Each of these institutions represents a \ngroup of people who come together for a common purpose. Few companies, however, live a long time and \nthose that do are generally in the beverage or hospitality business.2 Why do cities and universities grow old \nand companies die young? Further, is the rate of corporate longevity shrinking, stable, or expanding?    \n \nCorporate longevity is relevant for investors for a number of reasons. First, researchers frequently use \nlongevity as a proxy for the rate of innovation. Short corporate lives are associated with rapid innovation or \nwhat the economist Joseph Schumpeter called the \u201cperennial gale of creative destruction.\u201d3 Corporate lives \nare more fleeting if innovation is accelerating, which has implications for portfolio construction and the pattern \nof value creation. We will show that while there is a link between innovation and longevity, the level of mergers \nand acquisitions (M&A) explains longevity even better than innovation does.  \n \nLongevity also plays an important role in determining the size of the investable universe. The population of \npublic companies rises with spin-offs and initial public offerings (IPOs) and falls with M&A and delistings as \nthe result of bankruptcy. Because M&A has exceeded IPOs in the last two decades, the population of listed \ncompanies in the U.S. has dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s.    \n    \nFinally, investors generally measure the returns for active money managers versus a benchmark index. These \nindexes change their composition as index committees add and subtract companies. Comparing the results of \nan active investment manager to a benchmark index makes sense because investors consider the returns of \nan index fund as an opportunity cost. Just as companies must earn a return on investment in excess of the \nopportunity cost of capital to create value, investment managers must beat their benchmark to add value.  \n \nThere is a general sense that the rate of change is accelerating and that corporate longevity is shrinking. This \nassertion appears frequently in the business press. Our research shows a more nuanced picture. Indeed, a \ncommon measure of corporate longevity, turnover of the companies in the S&P 500, shows that longevity has \nlengthened in recent years. Here is a summary of the research: \n \nExhibit 1: Studies on Corporate Survival \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.

      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n3 \nThe S&P 500 had a market capitalization of $20.6 trillion as of January 31, 2017, which represents about 80 \npercent of the available U.S. market capitalization. The S&P 500 is a good proxy for the overall market \nbecause of its size.4 More than $7.8 trillion worth of mutual funds are benchmarked to the S&P 500, with \nindex assets making up 28 percent of that amount.5 Almost one-half of all actively-managed U.S. equity \nmutual funds, which control about 60 percent of total assets under management, use the S&P 500 as a \nbenchmark.6    \n \nWe examine the turnover in the composition of the S&P 500 to understand the causal drivers of additions and \nremovals. We consider whether turnover in the S&P 500 is a reasonable proxy for innovation in light of these \nresults. While we see an association between S&P 500 turnover and an index of innovation, M&A appears to \nhave a larger influence on the changes than the innovation index does. \n \nWhile researchers have analyzed the pattern of entry and exit, we go beyond this and analyze the \ncharacteristics of the companies coming and going. Specifically, we examine the total shareholder returns \n(TSR) for the three years before and the three years after a company is added to, or dropped from, the S&P \n500. We also look at the cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae\uf02a) for the same population to gauge the \nquality of the businesses.  \n \nWe find that the companies the committee adds to the S&P 500 have trailing TSRs and CFROIs that are \nabove average. The companies the committee removes fall into one of two camps. Those that exit as the \nresult of M&A have strong past TSRs and high CFROIs. Those that exit as the result of failure, or other \nfactors, have weak TSRs and low CFROIs. \n \nOne intriguing finding is that in the 12 months following an action, the companies the committee removes \nfrom the S&P 500 but that continue to trade vastly outperform the companies the committee adds. This is \nconsistent with regression toward the mean. The committee generally adds companies that have done well \nand have high embedded expectations, and removes companies that have done poorly and have low \nexpectations. The stocks with low expectations go on to outperform the stocks with high expectations.    \n \nThe population of the S&P 500, while economically large and significant, only represents a fraction of the \nbroader economy. As a result, we also examine the Fortune 500 to see whether the turnover of the S&P 500 \nis consistent with that of other big companies. The Fortune 500 is a list of the largest companies in the U.S. \nmeasured by revenue. It includes private companies for which there are data. We also look at longevity for \nsmaller companies via academic research and data from the U.S. Census Bureau. \n \nThe rate of change we see for the Fortune 500 is generally consistent with that of the S&P 500. For small \ncompanies, the entry rate is approximately 12-14 percent per year and the exit rate is about 10-12 percent. \nThis means that for an economy that starts with 100 companies, around 12-14 new companies will enter \neach year and 10-12 will leave. The result is modest growth in the number of companies. There is substantial \nbirth and death among young companies.      \n \n \n                                                 \n \n\uf02a CFROI\n\u00ae is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding the United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse \nGroup AG or its affiliates.  \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n4 \nThe main question is, \u201cWhy do companies die?\u201d Some die because of obsolescence, but most depart \ngracefully through M&A. The companies that the S&P 500 committee discards that continue to trade appear \nto present a small, but lucrative, investment opportunity. \n \nWhat Causes S&P 500 Turnover? \n \nExhibit 2 shows the turnover in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index from 1958 to 2016. We use data from \nFactSet for 1991 through 2016 and from Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, for the prior years.7 Over this span, the average annual turnover rate was 4.2 \npercent, which means there were approximately 20 changes per year. The removal of one company and the \naddition of its replacement constitute one change. Appendix A explains how we track deletions and additions.  \n \nExhibit 2: Turnover in the S&P 500 Index, 1958-2016 \n \nSource: 1958-1990: Jeremy Siegel, \u201cLong-Term Returns on the Original S&P 500 Companies,\u201d Financial Analysts Journal, Vol. 62, No. 1, \nJanuary/February 2006, 18-31; 1991-2016: FactSet, S&P Dow Jones Indices, Credit Suisse. \n \nThe trend line in the annual turnover rate rises gently from the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the rate of \nchange was a modest 3 percent, to an average turnover rate of about 4 percent over the past 5 years. \nPerhaps the most striking feature of exhibit 1 is that the turnover rate can swing wildly from year to year. For \nexample, the annual turnover rate was as low as 2 percent and as high as 11 percent from 1991 through \n2016.  \n \nWhat is the source of turnover? The high turnover in some periods, such as the dot-com bubble in the late \n1990s or the financial crisis in 2008-2009, makes sense and may be indicative of changes in the underlying \neconomy. But in most instances, the turnover tells us little about creative destruction.8  \n \nFor instance, the huge spike in 1976 turnover was the result of the S&P committee removing 40 industrial, \ntransportation, and utility companies and replacing them with financial stocks. Starting around 1996, the S&P \ncommittee started to manage the index more actively. Through much of the index\u2019s history, the committee \nonly modified the list of companies when it had to remove a stock for reasons including bankruptcy or \nacquisition. But over the past 20 years, the committee has been more proactive in removing firms that fail to \neffectively represent the industry in which they compete, or that fail to characterize the U.S. market.9  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n1958\n1960\n1962\n1964\n1966\n1968\n1970\n1972\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\nNumber of Changes\nTurnover\nAverage\nTrend line\n"

      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n5 \nAs a case in point, the index committee removed 7 companies in 2002 due to their \u201clack of representation.\u201d \nThis distinction most commonly refers to companies with market capitalizations at the low end of range for the \nindex. In that same year, the committee replaced 7 non-U.S. companies because they failed to meet the \nselection criteria at that time. This is despite the fact that some of the companies had been in the index and its \npredecessors for 60 years. Without the change in methodology, 14 of the 23 total changes in 2002 would \nhave been unlikely.  \n \nThis example reveals that the S&P committee\u2019s more active approach to managing the index explains about \none-third of the turnover over the past 20 years. Exhibit 3 shows the hypothetical turnover for the S&P 500 \nassuming the S&P committee managed the index from 1996 to 2016 in the same way as it did from 1958 \nto1995. We assume the committee would not have removed companies for \u201clack of representation,\u201d low \nmarket capitalizations, failing to meet certain profit criteria, or being domiciled outside the U.S. We also \nexclude the 40 changes in 1976 that were purely to change the industry makeup of the index.  \n \nWithout these changes, the gentle rise in turnover in exhibit 2 gives way to a nearly flat trend line. So what \nlooks like evidence of creative destruction at first glance may simply be more proactive index management.  \n \nExhibit 3: Hypothetical Turnover in the S&P 500 Index, 1958-2016 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nThe change in the S&P committee\u2019s approach to managing the index reveals the limitation of using turnover \nas a simple proxy for innovation. Yet there is a good fit between \u201cThe Shift Index,\u201d a measure of innovation \ndeveloped by consultants at Deloitte, and turnover in the S&P 500. Exhibit 4 shows the correlation between \nthe change in the Shift Index and the turnover in the S&P 500 from 1994 through 2015. The correlation \ncoefficient (r) is 0.65. The Shift Index has three component indexes. The \u201cfoundation index\u201d captures public \npolicy, infrastructure penetration, and technology performance. The \u201cflow index\u201d reflects virtual and physical \nflows, as well as amplifiers such as social media. The \u201cimpact index\u201d takes into consideration markets, firms, \nand people. The Shift Index combines these components in an attempt to quantify economic change.10  \n \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n1958\n1960\n1962\n1964\n1966\n1968\n1970\n1972\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\nNumber of Changes\nTurnover\nTrend \nline\n"

To answer this, we examine \nwhy the committee removed stocks from the S&P 500. Appendix B provides a detailed discussion of the basis \nfor additions to, and removals from, the index. Additions must meet specific criteria, but the committee has a \nfair amount of discretion in the decision to remove a company.   \n \nThe grounds for removal fall into one of three categories: \u201cM&A,\u201d \u201cFailure,\u201d and \u201cOther.\u201d M&A includes \nmergers, acquisitions, and companies that go private. We exclude other strategic deals such as spin-offs to \nshareholders or other forms of dividing a company.   \n \nFailure primarily includes companies the committee dropped from the index following a bankruptcy filing or for \nfailure to maintain a sufficient market capitalization.10 \n \n\u201cOther\u201d consists mostly of two groups. First are companies that realized a large decline in market capitalization \nfor reasons unrelated to performance, including special dividends or spin-offs. Second are companies that the \ncommittee eliminated for having a domicile outside the U.S. \n \nFor 2000 through 2016, we categorize each removal from the index based on the information that S&P \nprovides. This reveals that M&A, not failures, drives the majority of turnover in the index. Exhibit 5 shows that \nmore than half the removals are the result of M&A, while only one-third are from failure. The other category is \njust over one-tenth of the sample. Most failures are the consequence of a decline in market capitalization, not \nbankruptcy.

      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n8 \nThese categories reveal the limitations of simply associating turnover with creative destruction. For example, it \nis inaccurate to say that a company \u201cfailed\u201d if the S&P committee removed it following a divestiture that shrunk \nthe company\u2019s market capitalization below a threshold level. Likewise, it is hard to say that creative destruction \nwas the reason the committee removed a company after it was acquired for its strong growth and profitability.  \n \nThe Characteristics of Companies Added to, and Removed from, the S&P 500 \n \nThe next step of our study was an analysis of the characteristics of the companies the committee added and \nremoved from the S&P 500 Index. We focused on two measures. The first is three- and one-year total \nshareholder return (TSR), relative to the S&P 500, before the change and one and three years following the \nchange. TSR is the return an investor earns for a stock given the change in price and assuming that all \ndividends are reinvested.  \n \nThe second measure is the three- and one-year cash flow return on investment (CFROI) before the change \nand one and three years following the change. CFROI is a measure of the return a company earns on the \ncash it invests in its business. Because CFROI is adjusted for inflation, you can compare it over time without \nfear of distortion. Appendix D provides detail on the sample sizes of the various categories. \n \nExhibit 7 summarizes our observations about TSR.12 The S&P committee tends to add companies that have \nrealized strong past stock returns. The companies added from 2000-2016 had an average relative TSR of 23 \npercent per year for the 3 years before inclusion, and 41 percent for the year prior to inclusion. The median \nreturns, while more modest, are similarly high. The committee\u2019s behavior is consistent with other investors: \nThey buy high.13  \n \nExhibit 7: Trailing and Future TSRs for Additions and Removals from the S&P 500, 2000-2016 \n \nSource: FactSet and S&P Dow Jones Indices. \n \nThe companies the committee removed had three-year returns that lagged the S&P 500 and one-year returns \nthat were essentially equal to the index. Naturally, the TSRs reflect the reason the committee had to drop a \ncompany. (See exhibit 8.) For example, the companies that left as the result of M&A had average relative \nreturns of 4 percent per year for three years and 28 percent for one year.  \n \nCompanies that failed fared poorly prior to exclusion. Those companies had average relative TSRs of -32 \npercent per year for three years and -41 percent for one year. Companies that left the index for other reasons \nhad returns roughly in line with that of the S&P 500. For each type, the median returns prior to removal are \nsimilar to those for the mean. Companies that were acquired had excellent relative TSRs, those that failed had \npoor TSRs, and the other companies performed about in line with the market. \n \n \n-3 Year \nCAGR\n-1 Year +1 Year\n+3 Year \nCAGR\nAdded\n23%\n41%\n-2%\n-3%\nRemoved\n-9%\n3%\n28%\n3%\nAdded\n16%\n26%\n-3%\n0%\nRemoved\n-5%\n7%\n4%\n2%\nMean\nMedian\nTSR Relative to S&P 500\n"

To expand our analysis of longevity, we also examined the changes in the Fortune 500 over time. \nPublished annually by Fortune magazine, the list includes the 500 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenues. \nBecause it includes public, private, and mutual insurance companies, the Fortune 500 is a more complete list \nof America\u2019s largest companies.17 We estimate that roughly 315 companies are in both the S&P 500 and the \nFortune 500.  \n \nExhibit 12 shows annual turnover in the Fortune 500 since 1955, the year Fortune first published the list. We \nsee a pattern of turnover that is consistent with that of the S&P 500. On average, there are 32 changes per \nyear, representing turnover of roughly 6 percent, above the S&P 500 at about 4 percent. Similar to the S&P \n500, we see evidence of a modest rise in turnover. But the trend is down over the past 30 years. \n \nExhibit 12: Fortune 500 Turnover \n \nSource: Fortune and Credit Suisse. \n \nExhibit 13 presents another view of longevity for the companies on the list.18 We select five starting years\u2014\n1955, 1965, 1975, 1985, and 1995\u2014and track what number of the original 500 companies for those years \nremain on the list annually for subsequent years.19 For example, 362 of 500 companies on the 1955 list \nremained there 10 years later. After 15 years, only 294 of the 500 were still on the list. After 35 years, just \n170 of the 500 made the list. The steeper the slope of the line\u2019s decline, the more rapidly companies \ndisappear from the list. The lines that start at more recent dates do appear to drop faster, showing that there \nis indeed acceleration in turnover for the Fortune 500.

      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n13 \nBroadening the Sample\u2014From Big to Small \n \nWe have focused on big corporations because they reflect the overall economy and represent a large fraction \nof the investable universe. Investors focus on those companies with good reason. In the U.S. today, there are \n5.1 million total firms and only roughly 4,400 stocks trade on major exchanges.21  \n \nTimothy Dunne, Mark Roberts, and Larry Samuelson, a trio of economists, did a sweeping study of corporate \nlongevity, including entry and exit rates. Their analysis of more than 250,000 U.S. manufacturing firms \nshowed that roughly 35 percent of firms that enter an industry exit within 5 years, and that about 80 percent \nof entrants exit within 10 years.22 \n \nExhibit 15 shows the rate of entry and exit for U.S. establishments across all industries from 1977-2014, \nusing the U.S. Census\u2019s Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS). Most studies on corporate demography use \nestablishments, a rough proxy for firms, as the unit of analysis because that is the way the Census Bureau \ncollects and reports the data.  \n \nA useful way to think about entry and exit is to imagine an industry with 100 firms today. Based on the \naverage annual rates over the past decade, roughly 12-14 new firms will enter the industry and 10-12 firms \nwill leave in one year. This leads to modest growth in the total number of firms on average. Because entry \nrates typically exceed exit rates, the number of establishments in the U.S. increases over time. \n \nThe most recent data disclosed by the BDS show that approximately 25 percent of establishments fail within \nthe first year and just over one-half fail within five years.23 Mortality rates are high for young companies and \ndecline for companies that reach adolescence. \n \nExhibit 15: Establishment Entry and Exit Rates, 1977-2014 (United States) \n \nSource: U.S. Census Bureau; Center for Economic Studies; Business Dynamics Statistics; Credit Suisse. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\nEntry Rate\nExit Rate\n"

      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n14 \nWhy Companies Die (and Cities and Universities Live) \n \nImagine an ant colony with a nearby source of food. Foragers find the food source and use chemical signals to \ntell the other ants where to go to find the food. Call this exploitation. But some ants leave the chemical trail \nand wander around seemingly aimlessly. Call this exploration. Why would an ant ever leave the main trail to \nthe food? If another rich food source appears, the colony wants to have a mechanism to find it. Ant colonies \nbalance exploitation with exploration. But it gets even better: The rate of exploration is roughly correlated with \nthe rate of change in the environment.   \n \nOur speculation is that a similar model can help explain why companies die. Successful companies generally \nhave a core source of profits. For many reasons, corporate leaders tend to dedicate too many resources to \nexploitation of profits and not enough to exploration. Commonly, exploration requires a different structure than \nexploitation, causing companies to stumble. The best companies are those that can skillfully balance \nexploitation and exploration.24  \n \nBy contrast, cities and universities have less pressure to optimize, and hence are more capable of evolving and \nskirting failure. From a societal point of view, the rise and fall of individual companies may be healthy. But for \nan individual who is involved with a company on the decline, the pain is real. \n \nConclusion  \n \nCorporate longevity is important for investors for a handful of reasons. First, if longevity is contracting then \ninvestors need to rethink valuation, position sizing within a portfolio, and the magnitude of sustainable \ncompetitive advantage. Our analysis shows that while turnover in the S&P 500, a proxy for longevity, is \nreasonably well correlated to an index of innovation, the turnover is even better correlated to M&A activity. \nThat innovation and M&A are linked makes sense, but we also know that other factors, including capital \navailability, stock prices, and the institutional imperative, influence M&A waves.  \n \nOn balance, turnover for the S&P 500 and Fortune 500 is rising, but not at a dramatic rate. A better \ndescription is that turnover comes in waves. Further, changes in criteria contaminate the turnover results.    \n \nAnother reason that investors need to understand longevity is to assess the risk of failure for stocks within \ntheir portfolio. This is especially pertinent for investors in value and small capitalization stocks. About one-third \nof the removals from the S&P 500 over time have been companies we categorize as failures. These \ncompanies have poor TSRs and below-average CFROIs. Since these stocks are often inexpensive, they can \nrepresent value traps. The data also show that young companies, which are generally small and private, tend \nto have a higher mortality rate than companies that make it to adolescence. \n \nFinally, investors who have their results compared to a benchmark need to appreciate how that benchmark \nchanges. While most investors consider index funds to be passive, the indexes themselves change quite a bit \nover time. Note that the S&P beats roughly 60 percent of active managers in an average year and does so \nwithout any trading, macro forecasting, or limits on position or sector size.  \n \nThe S&P 500 committee presents a very attractive trading strategy. Using historical numbers, investors who \nbought the stocks that the committee removed from the S&P 500 (that still traded) and who sold short the \nstocks entering the S&P 500 would have earned a tidy excess return. It appears the S&P 500 committee \nbehaves in a way that many investors do: It buys high and sells low. \n \n"

So, to identify additions and deletions to the \nindex, we compare the CUSIPs of all members in one year to the CUSIPs in the following year. A stock\u2019s \nCUSIP allows us to trace a stock\u2019s lineage even if it has changed its name or ticker. \n \nDetermining the changes in the index range from the simple to the complex. For our period of analysis, some \nCUSIPs, such as that of Johnson & Johnson, were in the index every year and were tied to the same ticker \nand corporate name the whole time. Then there were examples like the CUSIP for Apple, Inc., which was tied \nto Apple Computer until the company changed its name in 2007. And finally, there were more complex \nexamples that not only demonstrate the dynamic elements of our economy, but also show how the S&P \ncommittee tries to capture and reflect such change. \n \nA merger is a good example. In December 1999, Monsanto and Pharmacia & Upjohn agreed to merge and \nform Pharmacia Corporation. In March 2000, S&P announced that it was going to remove Monsanto and \nPharmacia & Upjohn from the S&P 500 Index and replace them with Pharmacia Corporation and Linear \nTechnology. While this appears to be two changes to the index (i.e., two add/remove events), we only count it \nas one because Monsanto\u2019s CUSIP lived on in the combined entity. So, the only change is the replacement of \nPharmacia & Upjohn (71694110) with Linear Technology Corporation (53567810). \n \nRemoved:  \nMonsanto Company (71713U10) and Pharmacia & Upjohn (71694110) \nAdded: \nPharmacia Corp (71713U10) and Linear Technology (53567810) \n \nTreatment of Multiple Share Classes \n \nWe do not count the inclusion of additional trading lines of a company\u2019s stock as a change in the index. In \nMarch 2014, S&P revised how they treat companies with more than one class of common stock. Historically, \ncompanies could only be represented once in the index. The new methodology allows for multiple trading lines \nof a company\u2019s stock to be included in the index provided the lines meet certain requirements for liquidity and \nmateriality. So, while there are still only 500 companies in the S&P 500, the index can now have more than \n500 share lines. There are 505 share lines in the index as of February 6, 2017.25  \n \nDetermining Fiscal Years When Calculating Trailing and Future CFROIs \n \nWith knowledge of the month and year of the S&P\u2019s announcement, we estimate the most recent fiscal year \nfor which results would have been known. That fiscal year constitutes the trailing \u201c-1 year,\u201d and we base the \nother measurement periods off of that.  \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \nCorporate Longevity \n16 \nAppendix B \n \nHere\u2019s a look at how S&P constructs and oversees the index. The criteria for additions are more \nstraightforward than the grounds for removal. While the committee has some discretion in the companies they \nselect, additions must satisfy a list of criteria for eligibility including standards for market capitalization, liquidity, \ndomicile, public float, and earnings quality. Here are the attributes as of January 2017:26 \n \uf402\n Universe:   \n \n \n \nDomiciled in the U.S.  \n \uf402\n Market Capitalization:  \n$5.3 billion or greater. \n \uf402\n Public Float:   \n \n \nA minimum of 50 percent of shares outstanding available for trading. \n \uf402\n Financial Viability:  \n \nPositive reported earnings in the most recent quarter and over the most  \nrecent four quarters (in aggregate). \n \uf402\n Liquidity and Price:   \nHighly tradable stocks with active and deep markets. More specifically, \u201cthe  \nratio of annual dollar value traded to float-adjusted market capitalization \nshould be 1.00 or greater, and the stock should trade a minimum of 250,000 \nshares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date.\u201d \n \nThe grounds for removal, except in the case of M&A, are not as clear. For example, the committee may leave \nalone an index constituent that violates one of the criteria for addition, as meeting all the criteria is not \nnecessary for continued membership. Through much of the index\u2019s history, the S&P committee only modified \nthe list of companies when it had to remove a stock for reasons including bankruptcy or acquisition. But over \nthe past 20 years or so, the committee started to manage the index more actively by removing firms that no \nlonger effectively represented the U.S. market or the industry in which it operated.  \n \nS&P\u2019s primer on methodology reveals a tension between a passive and an active approach. On the one hand, \nS&P states that \u201cturnover in index membership should be avoided when possible.\u201d On the other hand, S&P \nsays it intends the index \u201cto reflect the U.S. equity markets and . . . the U.S. economy\u201d and to include \u201cleading \ncompanies in leading industries.\u201d The S&P 500 Index does not simply include only the largest companies in \nthe U.S., though, and many of its constituents are not in the top 500 as measured by either market \ncapitalization or sales. To meet the goal of having the top companies, some turnover is clearly inevitable and \nprompts the S&P committee to continually revise the index.  \n \n"

The authors examine the average \ntenure of a company in the S&P 500 over time and conclude that the rate of churn has accelerated. Their \nstudy spans from the late 1920s through the late 1990s. Because the S&P 500 wasn\u2019t formed until 1957, \nthey use the S&P 90 as a proxy in the early years. They show that turnover increased from about 1.5 percent \nin the 1920s and 1930s, an average lifespan of about 65 years, to nearly 10 percent in 1998, an average \nlifespan of 10 years. \nFoster and Kaplan attribute this increase in the rate of change to Peter Drucker\u2019s notion of the \u201cAge of \nDiscontinuity\u201d and Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s theory of creative destruction. These frameworks, the authors argue, \nshow how markets promote discontinuity by having new, more innovative entrants replace old, weaker \ncompanies. See Richard Foster and Sarah Kaplan, Creative Destruction: Why Companies That Are Built to \nLast Underperform the Market\u2014And How to Successfully Transform Them (New York: Random House, \n2001). \n9 Messod D.

The authors attribute the biggest \nflurry of activity to behavioral factors, or what Warren Buffett likes to call the \u201cinstitutional imperative.\u201d CEOs \nsee their peers doing deals and feel compelled to do deals of their own, even if valuations have already risen \nbeyond levels that are attractive. See: Peter J. Clark and Roger W. Mills, Masterminding the Deal: \nBreakthroughs in M&A strategy and analysis (London: KoganPage, 2013); Jarrod Harford attributes merger \nwaves to industry shocks, an increase in capital liquidity, and a reduction in financing constraints. See Jarrod \nHarford, \u201cWhat Drives Merger Waves?\u201d Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 77, No. 3, September 2005, \n529-560. Researchers also demonstrate a link between merger activity and share prices. See Ralph L. \nNelson, Merger Movements in American Industry: 1895-1956 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959), \nand Roger Clarke and Christos Ioannidis, \u201cOn the relationship between aggregate merger activity and the \nstock market: some further empirical evidence,\u201d Economics Letters, Vol. 53, No. 3, December 1996, 349-\n356. \n12 To minimize the impact of the announcement on the stock price, we measure TSR as follows: For trailing \nreturns, our ending point is one full day before the announcement (e.g., the trailing one-year return would be \n366 days before the announcement through 1 day before the announcement). For future returns, our starting \npoint is 1 day after the announcement. \n13 Scott D. Stewart, CFA, John J. Neumann, Christopher R.

They found that stocks deleted from the index had \naverage abnormal returns of -77 percent over the two years prior to removal, while stocks added to the index \nsaw average abnormal returns of 290 percent for the two years prior to their introduction. \n15 Kalok Chan, Hung Wan Kot, and Gordon Tang examined changes in the S&P 500 from 1962 to 2003 and \nfound that added and deleted stocks both delivered strong long-term results and that the average abnormal \nreturn for the deleted stocks exceeded those of the added stocks. They attribute the positive results for added \nstocks to \u201cincreases in institutional ownership, liquidity, and analyst coverage, and a decrease in the long-term \nshadow cost,\u201d and for deleted stocks to \u201ca rebound in institutional ownership and liquidity after stock deletion.\u201d \nThey note that \u201cthe long-term operating performance declines for added stocks and increases slightly for \ndeleted stocks subsequent to the year of stock addition or deletion (year t),\u201d suggesting that \u201cfirms are added \nto the index during their peak performance stage and cannot sustain this performance in the long-run. In \ncontrast, firms are deleted from the index during their worst performance stage but tend to recover somewhat \nin the long term.\u201d See: Kalok Chan, Hung Wan Kot, Gordon Y.N.

Anita Arora, Lauren Capp, and Gary Smith found similar results for the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage. The authors examined all additions and deletions to the Dow since 1928, excluding changes due to \nM&A or due purely to a name change. They created two portfolios, one of added stocks and one of deleted \nstocks, and then tracked their performance, accounting for changes to the Dow over time. The authors found \nthe deleted stocks, with annual returns of 15.9 percent, handily beat the added stocks, with annual returns of \n11.5 percent. The authors conclude that the results are statistically significant and cannot be explained by \nCarhart\u2019s four-factor model (CAPM, size, valuation, and momentum).

For \nexample, we count the 2016 Fortune 500 to be 2015 because the list published in 2016 largely reflects \nfinancial results for the year 2015. We exclude 1994 because Fortune changed its methodology that year, \nwhich led to a significantly high turnover number. To better represent changes in the U.S. economy, Fortune \nbegan to include service firms in its Fortune 500 list instead of listing them separately. \n18 We follow the presentation of Dane Stangler and Sam Arbesman, \u201cWhat Does Fortune 500 Turnover \nMean?\u201d Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, June 2012.  \n19 We are only able to track nine years following 1985 because Fortune changed its methodology in 1994 by \nexpanding beyond industrial, energy, and manufacturing firms to include service firms as well.    \n20 Leslie Hannah, \u201cMarshall's \u2018Trees\u2019 and the Global \u2018Forest\u2019: Were \u2018Giant Redwoods\u2019 Different?\u201d in Naomi R. \nLamoreaux, Daniel M.

It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary \nquantitative algorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all \nthe companies included in its database. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default \nvariables and incorporated into the algorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and \nearnings data provided by outside data vendors are subject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying \neconomics of firm performance. These adjustments provide consistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies \nacross industries or national borders. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline \nvaluation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce alternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional \ninformation about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request. \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT \nvaluation model establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default \nvariables may also be adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur.
