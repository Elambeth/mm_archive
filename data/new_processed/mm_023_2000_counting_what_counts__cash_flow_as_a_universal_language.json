      "text": "Counting What Counts\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial theory and empirical evidence both show that the value of a stock is the\nexpected present value of a future stream of cash flows. Faced with the complex-\nity of generating cumbersome cash flow models, many investors rely on invest-\nment shortcuts, or rules of thumb. Frequently, these rules of thumb are based\non earnings per share, a ubiquitous measure of profits. Earnings and price-to-\nearnings multiples do offer convenience, simplicity, and apparent uniformity. Un-\nfortunately, these apparent benefits are offset by significant economic disadvan-\ntages. This report unearths the serious and generally underappreciated risk of\nrelying on earnings and earnings-based measures as a proxy for value.\nThe key conclusions of this report are as follows:\n\u2022 \nEarnings and P/Es do not capture key determinants of value. For example,\nearnings-based measures do not account for risk, varying accounting stan-\ndards, sustainability of franchise, and investment needs. Variations in these\nitems from company to company mean that there is no reliable way to link\naccounting results with economic reality. As a result, single-period accounting\nmeasures like earnings are severely limited in their ability to reflect the prime\ndeterminants of value.\n\u2022 \nThe actual difference between earnings and cash flow is significant. Our de-\ntailed analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that in the most\nrecent fiscal year, on average only $0.82 in cash flow results from every\n$1.00 in reported (operating) earnings. Further, excluding General Motors\nand International Paper, this number falls to only about $0.71. But even these\ndata points are misleading. The range of cash flow/earnings ratio within the\nDJIA fluctuated from negative 0.08 to positive 2.6. This means that earnings\nand P/E comparisons can be highly misleading because they do not offer in-\nsight into a business\u2019s underlying economics.\n\u2022 \nAccounting for investments is different in the New Economy versus the Old\nEconomy. Companies that rely on physical assets capitalize their invest-\nments. Earnings, then, tend to meaningfully overstate the cash flow of the\nbusiness. In contrast, knowledge companies largely expense their invest-\nments. By definition, their physical capital needs are modest. So, earnings\nand cash flow are more aligned. All things being equal, companies that ex-\npense their investments will have higher P/Es than those that do not.\n\u2022 \nAccounting-based measures are more unreliable than ever. Accounting\nmeasures have always been limited in their ability to explain value. There is\nnothing new about that. What is new is that the source of value creation in\nthe global economy is rapidly evolving from one reliant on tangible goods to\none reliant on intangible goods. And the ability of the accountants to capture\nintangible assets leaves a lot to be desired. From employee stock option\ncompensation to reflecting intellectual capital, traditional accounting yard-\nsticks fall short. We offer no alternative to our accounting system, but note\nthat it is only a starting point, not an end point, in understanding value.\nInvesting is a very competitive activity. Investors that rely on widely disseminated,\nsuperficial measures like earnings per share risk missing the key drivers of eco-\nnomic value. A business is ultimately worth the present value of all cash inflows\nless all cash outflows. And our current accounting system makes it harder than\never to count what counts.\n"

      "text": "Counting What Counts\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nIntroduction\n\u201cIt is much easier for investors to utilize historic P/E ratios or for managers to util-\nize historic business valuation yardsticks than it is for either group to rethink their\npremises daily.\u201d\n\u2014Warren Buffett1\nBoth financial theory and empirical evidence support the view that a business is\nworth the present value of its expected future free cash flows. While few investors\nquestion this notion, many continue to use valuation metrics that are inconsistent\nwith this fundamental tenet of finance.\nSpecifically, the focus on accounting earnings per share (EPS) has led many to\nbelieve stock prices are strongly influenced, if not solely determined, by reported\nearnings. Indeed, earnings are the least common denominator for companies,\ninvestors, and the business press. They are routinely calculated, widely dissemi-\nnated, and broadly communicated.\nIt is no surprise, then, that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is widely used to\ndivine value. However, the P/E ratio is nothing more than a shorthand description\nof a mathematical relationship. As a result, it often attributes causality where\nnone exists. Multiples of earnings do not drive value; they are a function of\nvalue.2 Ultimately, the magnitude, timing, and riskiness of cash flows determine\nvalue. P/Es cannot offer any meaningful insight about these fundamental value\ndrivers.\nThink of it this way. We are asking the P/E to reflect a business\u2019s growth, risk,\ncapital intensity, management quality, economic returns, and sustainability of\ncompetitive advantage. If it seems like a lot of responsibility to heap on a single\nnumber, it is. It is more important than ever to understand the limitations of single-\nperiod measures like earnings and P/E ratios.\nThis report lays out a case for looking beyond ubiquitous earnings-based metrics.\nFurther, it provides a transparent framework, highlighting the difference between\naccounting convention and economic reality.\nWhat Makes Metrics Fail?\nAccounting Earnings Were Never Meant to Represent Cash Flow\u2014Financial\nstatements are designed to reflect a firm\u2019s past performance and current position.\nStock prices, in contrast, reflect expected future free cash flows. For equity in-\nvestors, reported history is simply the starting point for assessing a firm\u2019s prospects.\nEarnings\u2014past or forecasted\u2014serve as a point of departure in understanding\ncash flows.\nBecause there is a range of acceptable ways to calculate earnings under GAAP\n(generally accepted accounting principles), a given level of earnings can repre-\nsent an equally wide variety of cash realities. Some sources of difference be-\ntween earnings and cash flow include:3\n\u2022 \nRevenue recognition. Revenue recognition is one of the most difficult and\npressing problems facing the accounting profession.4 Accountants are guided\nto recognize revenue when it is \u201crealized\u201d and \u201cearned.\u201d5 However, it is be-\ncoming increasingly difficult to apply this conceptual framework in practice.\nFor example, some software companies defer a portion of product revenue to\nmatch possible future support costs and upgrades, making reported revenues\nand cash collected from sales differ materially. Further, improper or illegal\noverstatement of revenue can call into question future cash flows.6\n"

Pooling does not. Purchase companies must then amortize this\ngoodwill over no more than 40 years.\nHowever, goodwill amortization is a noncash, non-tax-deductible charge that\nreduces reported earnings but does not affect cash flow. This means that two\nidentical companies can consummate the same merger, chose different ac-\ncounting conventions, and have totally different earnings in spite of identical\ncash flows.\nThe key takeaway is that the economic consequence of a merger is not ulti-\nmately determined by the accounting choice, but rather by cash flows.\n\u2022 \nInventory valuation method. Companies can choose from various inventory\nvaluation methods including last-in, first-out (LIFO) and first-in, first-out\n(FIFO). In a period of rising prices, LIFO results in a lower reported earnings\nfigure than FIFO, because recorded expenses are higher. But it also de-\ncreases the cash taxes a firm pays, boosting cash flows. Empirical evidence\nshows the market reacts positively when a company announces a shift from\nFIFO to LIFO in an environment of rising prices.9\n\u2022 \nDeferred taxes. Varying depreciation methods can create a wide difference\nbetween a company\u2019s actual tax bill and the provision for income taxes that it\nshows on the income statement. Taxes deferred by accelerating depreciation\nare a source of cash. As long as a company remains a growing concern, de-\nferred taxes are a perpetual \u201cloan\u201d from the government.\nRisk\u2014Earnings do not provide any insight into the risk associated with a com-\npany\u2019s operations (although risk is implicit in P/E). Imagine two companies with\nidentical earnings and average expected future free cash flows. However, the\npotential dispersion of cash flow outcomes for company A is twice that of com-\npany B. It stands to reason that the market would reward company B a higher\nvalue.\nChart 1\nHighly Variant Cash Flows Increase Risk\nCompany A\nMagnitude of cash flow\nRange of Cash Flow\nMagnitude of cash flow\nRange of Cash Flow\nCompany B\nSource: CSFB analysis.\n"

A\nfundamental principle of economics is that industries that earn excess rents will\nattract new competitors, forcing industry returns to fall to the cost of capital. The\nCAP attempts to evaluate how long a business can generate returns on incre-\nmental investment above the cost of capital, and is primarily determined by a\nfirm\u2019s return on invested capital, the rate of change in the industry, and barriers\nto entry.\nIn practice, it is the forecast period employed in a discounted cash flow model.\nThe longer the time period, the more valuable the company. This can lead to\nvastly different P/Es for businesses with comparable earnings and near-term\nearnings growth rates.\nFor example, consider a company with a stable and predictable business model.\nSuch a business may be rewarded with a relatively long CAP. In contrast, a busi-\nness that operates in a fast-changing industry may have an excellent near-term\noutlook, but a limited CAP. The differences in the different CAPs for these com-\npanies will be reflected in their respective P/Es. Here again, value dictates the\nP/E\u2014not the other way around.\nInvestment Requirements\u2014Earnings do not, and were not designed to, capture\ncapital requirements.11 Investments, including working capital changes, capital\nexpenditures, and acquisitions, are cash outflows that are crucial in generating\nfuture value. Yet the investment intensity of two businesses that generate similar\nearnings growth rates need not be alike. The issue is further complicated by the\nfact that some industries capitalize their investments while others expense them.\nThis represents the critical source of divergence between earnings and cash flow.\nIt should be noted that neither positive free cash flow nor negative free cash flow\nis inherently good or bad. Indeed, positive free cash flow is undesirable if a com-\npany is not pursuing all of value-creating investments available, and negative free\ncash flow is desirable if economically attractive investment opportunities outstrip\ncurrent earnings. Our point is that simplistic measures of value, like P/E and cash\nflow multiples, do not give investors a sense of cash flows or returns on invest-\nment. Accordingly, such measures are immanently limited in value.\n"

      "text": "Counting What Counts\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nCounting What Counts: Measuring Investment Requirements\nWe believe the best way to capture diverse capital needs is by considering the\nincome statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows simultaneously.\nBy looking beyond the income statement, investors can quickly size up a busi-\nness\u2019s investment intensity.\nThe following case study demonstrates the method.\nCase Study: Microsoft and Coca-Cola\nMicrosoft Corporation\nMicrosoft is a prototypical knowledge-based business. As such, most of its\ninvestments are related to human capital, not physical capital. This observation,\nhowever, does not come close to capturing the discrepancy between the com-\npany\u2019s reported earnings and cash flow. In fact, Microsoft\u2019s earnings grossly\nunderstate its cash flows. Here\u2019s why:\n\u2022 The dichotomy begins with Microsoft\u2019s revenue recognition policy. When a\ncustomer purchases a Microsoft program, the company defers a portion of\nthe revenue \u201cattributable to . . . technical support and unspecified enhance-\nments.\u201d12 However, Microsoft receives all of the cash from its sales upfront. As\nTable 1 shows, in fiscal 1999 Microsoft actually collected over $21 billion in\ncash sales, meaningfully above the reported sum of $19.7 billion.\n\u2022 Working capital changes provided the company a source of cash. Microsoft\ncarries no inventory, and its current asset growth lagged the rise in account\npayables and other current liabilities. Unlike many growing businesses that\nsee working capital rise with additional sales, MSFT\u2019s cash flow economics\nare unaffected by working capital needs.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures were well below depreciation and amortization, adding\nover $400 million to the company\u2019s cash flow. Unlike many traditional, physical-\ncapital-oriented businesses, Microsoft requires few tangible assets to run its\nbusiness. As most of its investments are expensed, the income statement\ncaptures the magnitude of its investments.\n\u2022 Microsoft\u2019s use of employee stock options allowed it to offset taxes. When an\nemployee exercises an option, the employee is taxed on its intrinsic value (the\ndifference between the market and exercise price). Microsoft can then deduct\nthe compensation expense for tax purposes. For fiscal 1999, this tax break\nwas a staggering $3.1 billion. Said differently, Microsoft\u2019s cash tax rate was\n8.4% instead of the 34.5% posted on the income statement.\n\u2022 When combined, these adjustments made Microsoft\u2019s cash flow almost $4.8\nbillion, or 60.9%, higher than net income. This doesn\u2019t take into consideration\nthe $766 million of put warrants Microsoft sold in fiscal 1999. The income from\nthese warrants, which is not taxable, widens the earnings/cash flow gap even\nmore.\nCoca-Cola Company\n\u2022 Coca-Cola\u2019s working capital needs amounted to a net cash outflow of about\n$500 million in 1998. Even though the business did not grow much during the\nyear, funds were absorbed into the operations of the company.\n\u2022 Coca-Cola\u2019s capital expenditures exceeded its depreciation and amortization\nexpense by over $200 million. Given that Coca-Cola has consistently gener-\nated very high returns on capital, this relationship is noteworthy but not\nworrisome.\n"

Unlike a simplistic income statement analysis, our appraisal meas-\nures the impact of every item on cash. Companies seeking to boost reported\nearnings through accounting rather than economic means are exposed.\n\u2022 The bottom line is Coke\u2019s cash flow was 27.3% lower than its operating net\nincome in 1998. This is not unusual for a growing business. But it does sug-\ngest that comparing Coca-Cola\u2019s P/E to that of Microsoft is very misleading\ngiven the divergence between earnings and cash flow.\n"

While the average price-to-reported-earnings figure approximated 25 times\nin both calendar 1997 and 1998, the price-to-cash-flow multiple actually fell from\n44.5 in 1997 to 38.3 times in 1998.\nWe present these data not to validate the use of P/Es but rather to show how\nmisleading they can be. For example, consider two companies with an identical\nstream of future cash flows. Company A expenses its investments (marketing,\nR&D) while company B capitalizes its investments (working capital growth, capital\nexpenditures). Company A will correctly command a higher P/E, even though the\nbusiness value will be the same.\n"

In fact, multiples\nare not valuation, they are shorthands for the valuation process.

By\ndocumenting a firm\u2019s capital needs, especially those represented on the balance\nsheet, investors can better understand how a business creates value.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager\nor co-manager of a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies\nmentioned.
