It\nforces us to revisit deeply held beliefs about portfolio diversification, appropriate\nportfolio turnover, sustainable competitive advantage, competitive strategy\nanalysis, and valuation metrics.\nThis report concludes that continued rapid innovation is all but inevitable. We\nstart by documenting the evidence for accelerating innovation. This evidence\nincludes the following:\n\u2022 \nEconomic long waves\u2014economic booms that result from the launch of\ngeneral-purpose technologies\u2014are coming at a faster-and-faster rate. This\nsuggests that industry and product life cycles are shortening, and has\nimplications for government policy and corporate finance as well.\n\u2022 \nCorporate longevity is on the wane. The average \u201clife\u201d of a company in the\nS&P 500 today is less than 15 years, dramatically less than a half century\nago.\n\u2022 \nCompany-specific risk is rising steadily, even as aggregate market risk\nholds steady. This shifts the number of stocks a diversified portfolio needs.\n\u2022 \nCompetitive advantage periods are shortening even as the economic\nreturns for the market leaders in knowledge industries soar. These\ncountervailing factors render traditional multiple analysis useless.\nWe analyze the process of innovation on four levels:\n\u2022 \nWe first look at the economy as an ecological system. While the\nmechanisms for variation and selection are different in these two domains,\nthe parallels are sufficiently meaningful to warrant analogy.\n\u2022 \nEndogenous growth theory is a model that explicitly incorporates technology\ninto the equation for economic growth. One of the most important\nconclusions is that the larger the pool of ideas, the faster the potential for\ngrowth. This leads to increasing returns.\n\u2022 \nMichael Porter and his colleagues recently specified the determinants of\nnational innovative capacity. These include an appropriate infrastructure,\nindustrial clusters and a strong link between the two. While the U.S.\ncontinues to maintain a tenuous lead in this area, the performance of OECD\nnations is converging.\n\u2022 \nClay Christensen\u2019s innovator\u2019s dilemma remains a powerful way to consider,\nand anticipate, disruptive technologies at an industry or company level.\nWe suggest that investors consider three actions in response to this innovation.\nFirst, it is important to be wary of current market leaders, especially those with\nsizable market capitalizations. These companies are often the most vulnerable to\nfuture innovation. Second, find the future. Isolate those companies that represent\nthe next generation. Finally, avoid innovation risk all together by playing\nindustries that are sheltered from change.\n"

The economy, like the biosphere, is about persistent creativity in\nways of making a living.\u201d\n\u2014Stuart Kauffman, Investigations\nThrow out the old tools and rules of thumb, for the world of investing has forever\nchanged. The longstanding wisdom of buying a great business and holding it\nforever is no longer wise. Comparing companies based on their P/Es provides\nlittle or no insight. Yesterday\u2019s mental models do not speak to today\u2019s context.\nWe can sum up the source of this watershed change in one word: innovation.\nConsider this: five of the top fifteen companies in the S&P 500 by market\ncapitalization effectively didn\u2019t exist 20 years ago. Over 60% of the technology\ncompanies with current market caps over $50 billion came public in the past two\ndecades. These relatively new technology companies have a combined market\ncapitalization exceeding $1.5 trillion.\nThe lightning-quick shifts in market value today are an effective antidote for\ncomplacency. Both managers and investors realize that they must constantly\nseek value creation and competitive advantage in a fast-changing world. Change\nover the next twenty years will be sweeping, not incremental. The agile and\nadaptive will win. The ossified optimizers will lose.\nThis report looks at innovation\u2014the introduction of something new\u2014and what it\nmeans for markets. It contains three parts. First, we examine evidence that\nshows that innovation is not only vibrant but accelerating, and consider what this\nmeans for investors. Second, we provide some models for thinking about\ninnovation\u2014both on a macro and micro level. Finally, we prescribe a portfolio\nstrategy to accommodate the environment.\nAn overarching theme to our analysis is that there is a strong analogy between\nthe economy and the biosphere (as the Kauffman quotation above suggests).\nSpecifically, the increase in planet\u2019s ecological diversity over the past 4 billion\nyears can teach us great deal about the mechanisms and inevitability of business\ninnovation. What we know for sure is that innovation will continue to blossom.\nWhat we don\u2019t know is what form it will take. It was hard to imagine the likes of\nCisco, Yahoo, Oracle, America Online twenty years ago because the industries\nthey lead literally didn\u2019t exist. Likewise, our sense of tomorrow\u2019s titans is at best\nethereal.\n"

And the first stop is with the work of the eminent economist Joseph\nSchumpeter. While Schumpeter is best known for the phrase \u201cgale of creative\ndestruction,\u201d our interest here is with his work on \u201clong waves\u201d of economic\nactivity. In the 1939 book Business Cycles, Schumpeter examines the data on the\npresence, duration and regularity of long waves.\n1\nThe basic idea is that various economic eras feature different clusters of general\npurpose technologies, which catalyze the formation of new industries. A general-\npurpose technology enables, or opens up, new opportunities rather than offering\na complete solution.\n2 They are central to long wave formation because they are\ngeneral purpose and they spur complementary innovation. Examples include\nsteam, rail, electricity, and computers. These technologies create long waves of\ndevelopment that ripple through the economy, but the waves eventually peter out\nas technical advancements slow and returns on investment decline. This, in turn,\nleads to a period of slow expansion (or decline) until the next wave comes.\nSchumpeter argues persuasively for both the existence and regularity of long\nwaves. Yet there is nothing in his theoretical case that insists these waves have\nto appear in regular, prescribed intervals. Importantly, with the benefit of an\nadditional 60 years of history, we now see that these waves are coming at an\naccelerating rate (see Figure 1). For example, the wave spurred by water power,\ntextiles and iron (~1785-1845) lasted about 60 years, while the most recent wave\ndriven by digital networks, software and new media (~1990-2020) may last 30\nyears or less. The trend towards shorter waves is clear.\n3\nFigure 1\nSchumpeter\u2019s Waves Are Coming Faster and Faster\nSource: \u201cCatch the Wave,\u201d The Economist, February 18, 1999.\nThis accelerating periodicity has a number of implications for investors. First, it\nsuggests that industry life cycles, and hence product life cycles within industries,\nare becoming shorter. This makes a long-term (i.e., 20 years plus) buy and hold\nstrategy less attractive than it has been in the past. Second, it shines a bright light\non government policy. Historically, governments regulated many of the industries\nthat controlled innovation\u2014electric utilities, telecommunications and airlines to\nname a few. In today\u2019s knowledge-based world natural, albeit temporary,\nmonopolies emerge rapidly (e.g., Microsoft). Governments must walk the fine line\nof allowing monopolies to rise and fall while maintaining the incentives and\npaybacks for innovation.\nFinally, the increased wave frequency underscores the importance of matching a\ncompany\u2019s liabilities\u2014largely corporate debt\u2014with the useful life of its assets.\n"

And since equity holders have a residual claim,\nthey can see the value of their investment quickly go to zero.\n4 We believe this\nphenomenon is unfolding in parts of today\u2019s telecommunications sector.\n5\nCorporate Longevity is on the Wane\nWe see evidence of shorter corporate longevity in other data as well. The\naverage turnover in the S&P 500, measured by additions and deletions, was\nabout 3-4% per annum in the 1950s. That turnover suggested an average life of\nabout 25-35 years. Today, the annual turnover in the S&P 500 is about 7-8%,\nwhich reduces the average \u201clife\u201d of a company to just 12-14 years.\n6 Moreover,\nabout two-thirds of all startups fail within their first five years.\n7\nMore Technology Means More Change\nWebster\u2019s dictionary defines technology as \u201ca scientific method of achieving a\npractical purpose.\u201d It comes as no surprise, then, that composition of the stock\nmarket follows the breathtaking advances in science to some degree. In fact, the\nweighting of technology is four times greater today than it was a decade ago\n(28% versus 7%), as Figure 2 illustrates. Given that technology companies are\noften at the nexus of innovation, technology\u2019s increased influence injects greater\nrisk, and reward, into the overall market.\nFigure 2\nThe Rise of Technology\nS&P Composition 2000\nEnergy\n6%\nFinance\n16%\nHealth Care\n12%\nConsumer \nStaples\n11%\nTransportation \n1%\nUtilities\n3%\nConsumer \nCyclicals\n7%\nCommunication \nServices\n6%\nCapital Goods\n9%\nBasic Materials\n2%\nTechnology\n27%\nS&P Composition 1990\nBasic Materials\n7% Capital Goods\n10%\nCommunication \nServices\n9%\nConsumer \nCyclicals\n11%\nConsumer \nStaples\n17%\nEnergy\n13%\nFinance\n8%\nHealth Care\n10%\nTransportation \n1%\nTechnology\n7%\nUtilities\n7%\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nLarge Scale Stability from Small Scale Instability\nWhile the surge in technology weighting in the S&P 500 is a relatively new\nphenomenon, 40-year data show another sign of heightened innovation: an\nincrease in individual company volatility (greater idiosyncratic risk in finance-\nspeak). The authors of a very important recent paper show that while the\nmarket\u2019s overall volatility is well within historical bounds, the volatility of individual\nstocks has increased sharply since the early 1960s.\n8 The authors use standard\ndeviation as a measure of volatility.\nEnvision it this way: the overall market is like a Broadway show that is performed\nnight-after-night, but with new and different actors playing the various roles. The\nshow is stable, but the stability belies the increase in cast turnover. Aggregate\nstability is interspersed with substantial individual instability. The reason that\nlarge-scale stability can emerge from small-scale instability is that the correlation\n"

The traditional view\nis that an investor can eliminate idiosyncratic risk by holding a portfolio of 20-\n30 stocks. However, if the firm-specific volatility is higher than the traditional\nmodels suggest, appropriate diversification requires a portfolio of 50 or more\nstocks.\n\u2022 \nThis idiosyncratic risk is not linked to financial leverage. The authors note that\nfinancial leverage does not explain the increases in firm-specific volatility.\nIndeed, the increase in idiosyncratic risk corresponded with a reduction in\nfinancial leverage during the 1990s.\n\u2022 \nMarket composition? The authors review a host of potential explanations for\nthe volatility increase, none of which is fully satisfactory on its own. Their final\nidea relates increases in volatility to greater homogeneity of the investor\nbase. We identified a similar phenomenon, which we call a \u201cdiversity\nbreakdown.\u201d\n10 However, we do not believe this is the entire answer. Our\nsense is that the increase in firm-level volatility reflects a greater overall level\nof innovation.\nThe Move to a Knowledge Economy Means Higher Stakes\nThere is another consideration to add to the mix. The global economy is moving\nfrom being reliant on physical assets to knowledge assets. A sharp increase in\nthe q ratio\u2014the difference between market price and balance sheet asset value\u2014\nprovides evidence of this transition. One calculation shows the q ratio rising from\nabout 0.5 in 1980 to 2.5 in 2000.\n11 We stress this transition because the economic\nproperties and characteristics of physical goods are quite distinct from knowledge\ngoods.\n12 Notably, many knowledge businesses compete in winner-take-all or\nwinner-take-most markets. In these cases, the strong get stronger and the weak\nget weaker. Examples of winners include Microsoft (PC operating systems),\nAmerica Online (instant messaging) and eBay (consumer online auctions).\nThe evidence for winner-take-most outcomes shows up in total shareholder\nreturn data. Figure 3 shows the average total shareholder returns for the top\nthree and bottom three companies in each sector over the past six years (the\ndata are sector weighted). It shows that the shareholder returns for the winners\nare getting increasingly large, while the declines for the losers are getting\nsteeper. We need not identify the specific cast of characters to make the point\nthat the stakes of success and failure are on the rise.\n"

First,\nwe must conclude that the period of excess returns for an individual company,\nwhich we call \u201ccompetitive advantage period\u201d, or CAP, is shortening. Whereas a\ngeneration ago the market could reasonably assume that a company could\nsustain a franchise for a long time, such assumptions are not realistic today.\nContrast Microsoft with Coca-Cola. Microsoft has dominated its industry (defined\nnarrowly as the PC operating system) for roughly 20 years. Yet no one expects\nthem to dominate the industry 20 years from now, primarily because it is unlikely\nthe industry will exist. If Microsoft is to succeed, it will be in new markets. Coca-\nCola, in contrast, has steadfastly dominated the soft drink market, and is likely to\ndo so in the future. Past is prologue. In plain language this means that valuations\nfor fast-changing industries should be lower, all things equal, than more stable\nindustries.\nBut here\u2019s the twist: knowledge-based market leaders earn much higher\neconomic returns than anything we\u2019ve ever seen. This argues for higher\nvaluations. The economic returns of the market winners are not only extremely\nhigh on an absolute basis, they are significantly higher than their next\ncompetitors. Companies like Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, eBay and Yahoo all enjoy\nreturn on invested capital in excess of 50%, and in some cases, dramatically\n"

So while the CAP\u2019s the market accords these businesses may not be as\nlong as their steady-as-she-goes peers, they are often longer than their industry\ncompetitors (see Figure 4). Technology strategist Geoff Moore likes to sum up a\ncompany\u2019s competitive advantage as a the combination of \u201cGAP\u201d\u2014the\ndifferentiation in economic returns a company offers in the present versus its\ncompetition\u2014and CAP, the sustainability of that differentiation.\n13\nFigure 4\nCompetitive Advantage\nExcess Returns\nTime\nExcess Returns\nTime\nThe World As It Was\nThe World As It Is\nLow Excess Returns\nLong CAPs\nHigh Excess Returns\nShort CAPs\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nThe Twilight of Traditional Measures\nThe second repercussion for investors is that traditional valuation tools\u2014most\nnotably the price/earnings ratio\u2014are hopelessly flawed. These measures never\nreflected shareholder value particularly well, but have even less relevance as\nworld transitions from physical to knowledge capital as the source of value. Here\nare some basic reasons that historic valuation measures no longer provide a\nuseful measure:\n\u2022 \nThe nature of investment. All companies must invest in order to generate\nfuture returns. But knowledge-based companies tend to expense their\ninvestments (i.e., research & development, training) while capital-based\nbusinesses capitalize theirs (inventory, factories). The result is that the\nincome statement does not provide a consistent view of cash flows.\n\u2022 \nEmployee stock options. Companies are turning to stock-based\ncompensation more-and-more, and employee stock options (ESOs) are the\nvehicle of choice. Unfortunately, basic financial statements do not reflect the\nliability and future cost of ESOs. This renders the financial statements of\nmany knowledge-based businesses incomplete at best. For example, we\nestimate that the after-tax value of Microsoft\u2019s already-granted employee\nstock options was about $30 billion at year-end fiscal 2000.\n\u2022 \nReal option value. Given the heightened level of uncertainty, some\nbusinesses possess valuable real options. A real option, which is analogous\nto a financial option, is the right but not the obligation to make a potentially\nvalue-creating investment. It is important to explicitly deal with these options,\nsomething that traditional valuation tools are unable to do.\n14\n\u2022 \nRisk. Earnings per share or EBITDA measures do not take risk into\nconsideration. For example, two companies may have identical expected\nearnings but different dispersions of earnings outcomes. The company with\nthe wider dispersion justifiably deserves a lower valuation multiple.\n"

Current and near-term future earnings provide no\ncontext for understanding the market\u2019s long-term cash flow expectations.\nThe failure of conventional valuation tools calls into question all historical\ncomparisons. A prerequisite for a statistically valid comparison is what\neconomists call \u201cstationary data.\u201d Basically, the comparison of averages is only\nmeaningful if you draw from the same sample. When data are drawn from\ndifferent samples, they are said to be non-stationary. When data are non-\nstationary, projecting past averages produces nonsensical results.\n15 Much of the\nhand wringing over valuation in recent years is based on non-stationary data. You\ncan\u2019t compare today\u2019s P/E\u2019s to those of the past because the sample populations\nare dramatically different.\nOne example is the \u201cmarket\u2019s\u201d valuation.

      "text": "Innovation and Markets\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nModels of Innovation\nWe consider innovation on four levels. We first argue that innovation, and\nincreased diversity, is a well-established process in the biological world, and that\nthe parallels between the biological and economic worlds are sufficiently strong to\nwarrant analogy. Second, we turn to endogenous growth theory, a\nmacroeconomic model that explicitly incorporates technological innovation. Third,\nwe look at the key determinants of innovation at a national level. Finally, we\nsummarize the microeconomic model for innovation laid out by Clay Christensen.\nThe Big Picture: Ecology and Economics Have the Same Root\nStuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist, makes an articulate case that we should\nview economics much in the same way that we view an ecosystem.\n17 A\nspectacular diversity of species exists today, all descendants of the Earth\u2019s first\nsingle-cell life form, which emerged some 3.5 billion years ago. And change is\nendemic: over 99% of the species to have ever roamed the earth are now extinct.\nThis leads us to four areas of commonality between biology and business.\n18 While\nthe mechanisms of variation and selection are clearly different in the two\ndomains, in both cases \u201corganisms\u201d and trying to \u201cmake a living.\u201d\n\u2022 \nSelection. Species and business both die out due to their inability to respond\nto changes in their surrounding environment. Also, extinction results from one\nspecies, or business model, substituting for an established one. In either\ncase, selection plays a central role in dictating longevity.\n\u2022 \nComplementarity. Changes in the environment and its population constantly\ncreate ecological niches, which are \u201cfilled\u201d by new life forms. More diversity\nmeans more niches, leading to more diversity, and so on. Species and\ncompanies evolve, co-evolve and co-create in order to take advantage of\ntheir environment. But the process is rarely smooth: change generally comes\nin fits and starts.\n\u2022 \nScaling laws. The lifetimes of species, studied over the past 600 million\nyears, appear to follow a power law distribution\u2014most species die young,\nwhile very few last a long time. It appears that firm lives follow a similar\npattern.\n19\n\u2022 \nSelf-organization. Both biological and economic systems are self-organizing,\nwhich means that they are neither too rigid nor too chaotic. Too much rigidity\nleads to a lack of flexibility; too much chaos leads to an inability to capitalize\non the environment. Physicist Gene Stanley found that this sweet spot was\nthe only one that made his model of company behavior look like the real\nthing. His work shows deep parallels between the physical and economic\ndomains.\n20\nOne of Schumpeter\u2019s main contributions to economics is to look past states of\nequilibrium and focus on the process of change. He argues that one cannot\nunderstand, or model, innovation using equilibrium concepts. In his words, \u201cThe\nessential point to grasp is that in dealing with capitalism we are dealing with an\nevolutionary process.\u201d Schumpeter\u2019s ideas are clearly consistent with a natural\nview.\nThe similarities between nature and the economy are strong enough to be\ninstructive. Many of the forces that shape biological evolution apply in the\nbusiness world as well. We now turn to economic theory to help understand\ninnovation and growth.\n"

      "text": "Innovation and Markets\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nMacro Economics: Endogenous Growth Theory\nEconomist Paul Romer asks and answers a fundamental question: Why are we\nsome much wealthier today than 100 years ago, when the amount of physical\nresources on the earth is essentially unchanged? The answer lies in our growing\nability to rearrange those resources in more valuable ways.\nClassical models of economic growth rely on capital and labor as the inputs, and\ntreat technology as an exogenous factor. Robert Solow was the first to include\ntechnology into the model, but he made it a public good\u2014something that could be\nused by all.\n21 Romer\u2019s contribution to the literature is to not only make technology\nendogenous to the model, but also a \u201cpartially excludable\u201d, or a private good. In\nthis context, we define technology as \u201csoftware\u201d \u2014a set of instructions, formulas,\nor processes that allow us to create value.\nThe key is that software\u2014which drives our ability to recombine the existing world\nin novel ways\u2014has different characteristics than physical capital or labor. More\nspecifically, it is a \u201cnon-rival\u201d good: unlike physical resources, more than one\nperson can use software at a time. In an ideal world, this allows us to pass\nsoftware along cheaply and easily without causing congestion.\n22\nOne key idea that comes out of this literature is \u201cincreasing returns.\u201d The more\nsoftware that is in existence, the more opportunities that arise. In fact, the larger\nthe body of software, the faster the growth potential. This notion lies at the heart\nof endogenous growth theory. Most inventions combine existing technologies in\nnovel ways to solve a given problem. The more building blocks that exist, the\nmore potential opportunities there are to find solutions.\nA simple mathematical example illustrates the point. Assume you had four\nbuilding blocks to create potential solutions. The number of possible\ncombinations is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, or 24. Now add two building blocks, to 6. The new\nnumber of potential combinations\u20146 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, or 720\u2014is 30 times\ngreater. As Romer likes to point out, you can sequence 20 steps in roughly 10\n19\nways, a number larger than the total number of seconds that have elapsed since\nthe birth of the universe.\nMany great inventions are the result of recombining existing technologies\nincluding airplanes (composites, electronics, hydraulics), automobiles\n(combustion engines, gears, computers) and personal computers (silicon,\nplastics, storage). And the fact that more software building blocks leads to faster\ngrowth is fundamentally bullish in the aggregate, even if individual companies\ncome and go. It is true that the vast majority of the imaginable software\ncombinations are useless. But with computing power and cheaper\ncommunications, we will find new solutions faster, and more cost effectively, than\never before.\nAnd we can be sure that major advances in computing, communications and\nstorage still lie ahead of us. Figure 5 shows the compounded annual price\ndeclines for a handful of key general-purpose technologies. As we can see, the\nrelative price declines of earlier general purpose technologies pale next to\ncomputing and telecommunications. And the best is yet to come.\n"

But Kurzweil puts it in\nextraordinary context: by his calculations, a $1,000 computer device will achieve\nhuman brain capacity by 2025. The point is that we are on the cusp of a surge\ncomputational power, which is very likely to heighten the pace of innovation.\nBut computing power is only part of the story. Another fundamental driver is the\nplummeting costs of communications. Gilder\u2019s Law suggests that bandwidth\ngrows at least three times faster than computer power. As Gilder points out,\npractical backbone bandwidth on a single cable is now a thousand times greater\nthan the entire traffic on the global communications infrastructure five years ago.\nGilder writes \u201cMore information can be sent over a single cable in a second than\nwas sent over the entire Internet in 1997 in a month.\u201d\n25\nInformation storage is exploding as well. The world currently produces between 1\nand 2 exabytes (an exabyte is a billion gigabytes, or 10\n18 bytes) of unique\ninformation per year. This means that over the next 2 \u00bd years, more information\nwill be produced than was created since the dawn of civilization! And since the\ncost of magnetic storage is dropping sharply\u2014the cost of a gigabyte of storage\ntoday will drop 90% over the next five years alone\u2014it will soon be technologically\npossible for the average person to access virtually all recorded information.\n26\nThe extraordinary combination of increased computing power, lower\ncommunication costs and vast information storage all suggest that it will be easier\nto assemble the building blocks of innovation in the future than it has been in the\npast. We are only starting to realize the full power of these exponential\nprocesses.\n"

      "text": "Innovation and Markets\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nNational Innovative Capacity\nWe now turn to the determinants of innovative capacity on a national level. A\nrecent paper by Scott Stern, Michael Porter and Jeffrey Furman presents a\nrobust, and empirically tested, framework to do this.\n27 The authors define national\ninnovative capacity as \u201cthe ability of a country to produce and commercialize a\nflow of innovative technology over the long term.\u201d They suggest three prime\ndeterminants:\n\u2022 \nStrength of a nation\u2019s common innovation infrastructure. This infrastructure\nincludes the nation\u2019s science and technology policy, the mechanisms for\nsupporting basic research and higher education as well as the cumulative\nstock of software, or technological knowledge. This point is closely tied to the\nendogenous growth model.\n\u2022 \nThe environment for innovation in a nation\u2019s industrial clusters. This\ninnovation orientation, which Porter articulated in The Competitive Advantage\nof Nations, relies on four factors. First is the context for strategy and rivalry.\nYou need a local context that encourages innovation-related investment and\nwhere there is spirited competition. Second are appropriate input conditions,\nincluding high quality humans resources, capital, and research and\ninformation infrastructures. Third is the presence of support industries,\nincluding suppliers. And finally the demand conditions must exist. They must\nbe sophisticated and demanding local customers that anticipate needs\nelsewhere.\n\u2022 \nThe strength of the link between the infrastructure and clusters. If\ninfrastructure is about generating and stocking ideas and clusters form to\ncommercialize them, you must have a strong link between the two to spur\nnational innovation.\nThe authors find that the United States is consistently in the top tier among the\nOECD countries, but that there is a pattern of convergence of innovative capacity.\nAnecdotally, it seems that Silicon Valley\u2019s vaunted position as the hub of\ninnovation is increasingly under challenge from other areas. This is especially\ntrue of the developments in wireless technology in Scandinavian countries.\nThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\nWe wrap up with a micro look at innovation with Clay Christensen\u2019s disruptive\ntechnology model. Christensen\u2019s model shows a pattern by which dominant firms\ncan fail, leading to sharp downward financial revisions. His argument is that many\ncompanies fail to maintain their leadership positions in spite of thoughtful\nmanagers that make sensible decisions based on accepted management\nprinciples. Hence the title of his best selling book, The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma.\n28\nHis framework is based on three findings. First, there is an important distinction\nbetween sustaining and disruptive technologies. Sustaining technologies foster\nproduct improvement. They can be incremental, discontinuous, or even radical in\nnature, but they operate within a defined \u201cvalue network\u201d\u2014the \u201ccontext within\nwhich a firm identifies and responds to customers\u2019 needs, solves problems,\nprocures input, reacts to competitors, and strives for profit.\u201d In contrast, disruptive\ntechnologies offer the market a very different value proposition than before. Such\nproducts may only appeal to a small number of customers at first, and often\nunderperform established products in the near-term. As a result, disruptive\ntechnologies are often overlooked, ignored or dismissed by leading companies in\ntheir early stages.\nSecond, technologies often progress faster than what the market demands. So\nestablished companies often provide the market with more than it needs or is\n"

This allows disruptive technologies to emerge, because even if\nthey underperform customer demands today, they become performance\ncompetitive tomorrow.\nFinally, passing over disruptive technologies may appear rational for established\ncompanies. This is because disruptive technologies generally offer low margins,\noperate in insignificant markets and are not in demand by the company\u2019s leading\ncustomers (yet). So companies that \u201clisten to their customer\u201d and practice\nconventional financial wisdom pass on disruptive technologies.\nFigure 7 shows the Christensen model graphically. The key for investors is to\nidentify disruptive technologies early. If it is successful, there are two ways to\nmake money: own the disrupter and short the incumbent.\nFigure 7\nThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\nProgress due to\nsustaining technologies\nPerformance\ndemanded at the high\nend of the market\nProgress due to\nsustaining technologies\nDisruptive\ntechnological\ninnovation\nPerformance\ndemanded at the low\nend of the market\nSource: Clayton Christensen, The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\nChristensen dwells on the disk drive industry in his book, but disruptive\ntechnologies lurk in many industries, including healthcare (genomics versus\npharmaceutical), photography (digital versus paper), retailing (e-commerce\nversus land based) and brokerage (electronic versus representatives). So\ninvestors must be keenly aware of emerging technologies, and consider whether\nthey are possibly disruptive and whether or not the established market leaders\nare aware of it. Andy Grove\u2019s Only the Paranoid Survive is essentially a book\nabout how to avoid being displaced by disruptive technology. His prescription:\nembrace the next technology wave (even if it cannibalizes your current business)\nbefore someone else does. Companies must constantly renew their business or\nrisk losing their competitive advantage.\nWe now have a comprehensive set of frameworks for thinking about innovation\non multiple levels. The conclusions are twofold. First, there is every reason to\nbelieve that innovation will not only continue, it will accelerate. Second, there are\nmodels for evaluating innovation on multiple levels that may be very helpful in\nstock picking.\n"

      "text": "Innovation and Markets\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nWhat Investors Should Do\nThis discussion points to both some general action steps as well as specific\nrecommendation for stock picking. The general action steps include:\n\u2022 \nReassess diversification. Here\u2019s the conundrum. The increase in company-\nspecific volatility suggests a that a portfolio must be larger to be fully\ndiversified than the past. On the other hand, there appears to be a higher\nincidence of winner-take-most outcomes in various industries, in which case\nyou want to concentrate your bets on the winner.\n29 Balancing diversification\nwith winner-take-most markets is a challenge.\n\u2022 \nUpdate valuation tools. Our accounting system was essentially designed 500\nyears ago to track the movement of physical goods. It is grossly inadequate\nto reflect today\u2019s economic realities, which include a surge in intangibles,\nemployee stock options, and greater real option value. Applying historical\nP/Es to today\u2019s market in nonsensical. This by no means is a justification for\nvaluations, it is simply to stress that investors cannot intelligently judge\ncurrent circumstances with outmoded tools.\n\u2022 \nUpdate mental models. Most investors grew up in a world dominated by\ntangible capital. The world is rapidly evolving to one based on intangible\ncapital. While the laws of economics have by not been repealed, it is\nimportant to recognize that the properties and characteristics of intangible\ncapital are different from tangible capital. Accordingly, investors need to\nupdate mental models to deal with the new sources and means of value\ncreation.\nWe finish with some comments about stock picking:\n\u2022 \nAvoid the twilight. As the Innovator\u2019s Dilemma shows us, it is often hard for\nthe market leaders to stay on top for long. There are a number of factors\nworking against them. First, the stock market tends to build in lofty\nexpectations for growth and earnings. Market leaders feel the pressure to\ndeliver against those expectations, and hence tend to rely heavily (and\nperhaps too long) on their current technology. Second, many innovations\ncome from small companies with limited bureaucracies and a strong mission.\nThis is not to say that market leaders cannot stay on top. But managers have\nto be highly adaptive. Further, since stock prices react to changes in\nexpectations, there must be room for upward revisions.\n\u2022 \nFind the future. Here is the focus is on finding the next disruptive technology.\nWe like the strategy that Geoff Moore and his co-authors suggest in The\nGorilla Game. They recommend owning all companies that are potential\ngorillas (winners in the winner-take-most market) and pare back all holdings\nexcept the gorilla as it emerges. This strategy in part speaks to the\ndiversification conundrum mentioned above.\n\u2022 \nAvoid innovation. Notwithstanding the points raised in this report, some\nindustries and companies remain relatively sheltered from the competitive\nravages of innovation. A plausible volatility-dampening strategy is the barbell\napproach\u2014a mix of high growth technology stocks and relatively innovation\ninsensitive stocks.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager\nor co-manager of a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies\nmentioned.\nAMERICA ONLINE INC.
