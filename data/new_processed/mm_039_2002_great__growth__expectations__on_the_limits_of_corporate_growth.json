A few people have\ntaken the abstinence pledge, but it\u2019s very few.\u201d\nCharlie Munger\nOutstanding Investor Digest1\nCompounding and Confounding\nManagers and investors generally consider growth to be an absolute good. Managers routinely\ndiscuss stretch objectives and sometimes even embrace \u201cbig, hairy audacious\u201d goals to\nmotivate their employees and to impress their shareholders. Growth investors routinely seek\ncompanies that promise rapid, sustainable increases in sales and earnings.\nBut most investors do not intuitively understand the power, and onus, of compounding. To see\nhow you stack up, take this little quiz:\nOne dollar today ($1) becomes how much when compounded over 20 years? Write the amount\nin the space provided.\nStarting amount:\nCompounded at:\nBecomes how much after 20 years?\n$1\n2%\n________\n$1\n7%\n________\n$1\n15%\n________\n$1\n20%\n________\nFor most of us, these calculations do not come naturally. A 2% compounded annual growth rate\n(CAGR) over 20 years turns $1 into $1.49. A 7% growth rate equals $3.87. A 15% rate\u2014a\ncommon earnings growth goal among large companies\u2014implies a value of $16.37. And finally,\n$1 compounded at a 20% rate becomes $38.34.\nHow did you do? If you are like most people, you had difficulty properly gauging the relationship\nbetween the growth rate and the ending value. For example, it is not intuitive to most investors\nthat an increase from 15% to 20% growth implies more than a value double after 20 years.\nThat\u2019s why Albert Einstein called compounding the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d The trick for\ninvestors is to make the compounding work for them, not against them.\nReality Check\nIn the insightful book, Profit from the Core, Bain & Company consultant Chris Zook reveals a\nstudy of the companies that actually achieved sustained growth in the 1990s.2 The sample drew\nfrom over 1,800 companies in 7 countries that had sales in excess of $500 million.\nMichael J. Mauboussin\n212-325-3108\nmichael.mauboussin@csfb.com\nKristen Bartholdson\n212-325-2788\nkristen.bartholdson@csfb.com\nApril 23, 2002\nVolume 1, Issue 8\nGreat (Growth) Expectations\nOn the Limits of Corporate Growth\n"

In fact, Bain found that two-thirds of\nthe companies it examined had double-digit nominal growth rates built into their plans.\nFigure 1 shows the study results. As it turns out, only about 25% of all companies achieve the sales growth\nrate, and just one in eight meets all criteria for sustained growth. Notably, these results are against one of\nthe most buoyant economic backdrops in a generation. The vast majority of companies seek (and plan!) to\ngrow at a double-digit rate and the vast majority do not.\nFigure 1: Few Companies Achieve Sustainable Growth\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\u0005\u0003\n\u0004\u0006\u0003\nMeet Only\nRevenue Criterion\nMeet Both\nRevenue And\nIncome Criteria\nMeet All Value\nCreation Criteria\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\u0005\u0003\n\u0004\u0006\u0003\nMeet Only\nRevenue Criterion\nMeet Both\nRevenue And\nIncome Criteria\nMeet All Value\nCreation Criteria\nSource: Worldscope database, Bain analysis.\nHow acute is the potential gap between perception and reality? To check that, we first looked at the\ndistribution of 10-year sales growth rates (1992-2001) for U.S. companies with base-year revenues in\nexcess of $500 million. (See Figure 2.) The average growth rate for that group was 7.4%, and less than one-\nthird of the companies sustained double-digit nominal top-line growth. Further, these growth rates do not\nadjust for acquisitions, so the organic growth rate is almost surely lower.3\nFigure 2: Frequency Distributions of 10-Year CAGRs in Sales, 1992-2001\nfor companies with $500M+ in base year revenue\n0%\n1%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n5%\n6%\n7%\n-52%\n-43%\n-33%\n-24%\n-15%\n-6%\n3%\n12%\n21%\n30%\n39%\n48%\n57%\n66%\n10-Year CAGR in Sales\nFrequency\nSource: FactSet, CSFB analysis.\n"

Even though the earnings growth has been historically roughly 100 basis point higher than sales\ngrowth, the analytical point is unchanged.4 Notwithstanding two years of poor market performance, the\naverage expected growth rate for this group, at 14.8%, is still roughly double the rates that companies\nachieved in the recent past. Also noteworthy is that the distribution of expected growth doesn\u2019t include any\nnegative rates.\nFigure 3: Expectations Gap?\nfor companies with $500M+ in base year revenue\n0%\n1%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n5%\n6%\n7%\n8%\n9%\n-52% -43% -33% -24% -15%\n-6%\n3%\n12%\n21%\n30%\n39%\n48%\n57%\n66%\n10-Year CAGR\nFrequency\nSource: FactSet, CSFB analysis.\nWhat is the significance of a 15% growth rate versus a 7% rate? Our compounding exercise shows that after\n20 years at the 15% rate, the end value is roughly four times higher. As companies get larger, sustaining\ndouble-digit rates becomes very difficult. So if past is prologue, the expected growth rates for many companies\nwill have to come down.\nThe Bigger They Are, the Slower They Grow (or Don\u2019t Grow)\nThe entire population of company sizes, like city sizes, tends to follow a distinct distribution.5 In models that\nreplicate this distribution, scientists note that average growth rates are independent of size and that the growth\nrate variance declines with size. Call it the cone of growth.\nFigure 4 shows this graphically. Here we looked at the 10-year compounded annual sales growth rate for\n1,600 U.S. companies. The horizontal axis is on a log scale. The chart shows that while the average growth\nrate for small and large companies is approximately the same, there is less likelihood that a large company will\ngrow or shrink rapidly. Investors often call this the law of large numbers\u2014big companies can\u2019t grow as fast as\nsmall companies\u2014but it\u2019s more accurate to say that big company growth doesn\u2019t vary much from the average\ngrowth rate.6\n"

Nothing can be further from the truth! The problem is that while we know\nthat some companies will grow rapidly in the future, spurring upside revisions and attractive shareholder\nreturns, we have no systematic way to identify those companies. Therein lies a great opportunity.\nTo demonstrate that growth is good but that it\u2019s hard to take advantage of it, we turn to Jeremy Siegel\u2019s\nexcellent analysis of the Nifty Fifty in his investment classic Stocks for the Long Run.7 The Nifty Fifty were the\nleading growth stocks in the early 1970s, and had high growth rate expectations and price/earnings (P/E)\nmultiples in excess of 40. In the subsequent bear market of 1973-74, these stocks as a group dropped sharply.\nSiegel asks a basic question: Were the Nifty Fifty overvalued in 1972 based on their subsequent total\nshareholder returns? Based on his analysis, the answer is no. While some stocks did much better than the\nmarket (Philip Morris, Gillette, Coca-Cola) and others did much worse (Burroughs, Polaroid, Black and\nDecker), on balance they delivered a return consistent with that of the overall market. Siegel\u2019s point is that\nbased on ensuing performance, the warranted P/E in 1972 was much higher for some companies and much\nlower for others. But on average, the P/E was just about right.\nWe updated Siegel\u2019s data through 2001 and found that the conclusion remains the same. The total\nshareholder return for the surviving Nifty Fifty averaged 11.8%, essentially identical to the S&P 500\u2019s return.\nEarnings growth rates, too, are in-line with the market\u2019s. This is consistent with the evidence that growth and\nvalue funds tend to generate similar returns over time.\nRefuse Refuge in Castles in the Air\nThat there\u2019s a gap between expectations and reality is not new. For example, bottom-up estimates of S&P 500\nearnings have consistently been more optimistic than the top-down appraisal. But today the issue seems\ncompounded by the earnings expectations game.8 Managers and investors engage in an expectations-bar-\nraising ritual. Executives work to meet or beat Wall Street\u2019s forecasts, which encourages analysts to increase\ntheir expectations, and compels the executives to deliver even more growth\u2014by whatever means possible.\n"

This evolution has created its own sophisticated art form promoting\nand managing expectations. Of course, this has nothing to do with actually operating a business on a day-to-\nday basis, and is becoming at best a distraction from the real work of the company . . . the \u2018at worst\u2019 conjuring\ndoesn\u2019t need detailing here.\u201d\nGillette\u2019s new CEO, Jim Kilts, blazed a similar path by \u201cridiculing\u201d the prior management\u2019s 18% earnings per\nshare goal. He noted that unrealistic expectations led to excess overhead costs and actions aimed at boosting\nshort-term results, including prices increases, lower advertising spending and building excess inventory, at the\nexpense of the company\u2019s long term health.\nInvestors and managers must have reasonable expectations. The evidence shows that sustaining rapid growth\nis very difficult, especially for large corporations. Further, while there is nothing wrong with growth stocks, the\nindications are that it is very difficult to know which companies will exceed expectations and which will\ndisappoint. Investors should continue to focus on investment ideas where the expected value is favorable\u2014\nwhere the upside opportunity outstrips the downside risk.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager or co-manager of a\npublic offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies mentioned.\n_____________________________\n1 Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, \u201cIt\u2019s Stupid the Way People Extrapolate the Past\u2014and Not Slightly Stupid, But\nMassively Stupid\u201d, Outstanding Investor Digest, December 24, 2001.\n2 Chris Zook with James Allen, Profit from the Core (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2001), 11-13.\n3 We mention this because voluminous evidence suggests that mergers and acquisitions are a value negative, or at best, a\nvalue neutral activity. So growth via acquisition is often not value creating.\n4 In the ten years ended 2001, the median sales growth rate for the Fortune 500 was 7.6% and the median earnings per\nshare growth rate was 8.3%.\n5 Firm sizes and cities follow a Zipf distribution.
