He was in a \nquandary and wanted to talk it through. The company had been \ngenerous in granting stock-based compensation (SBC), and the \nexecutive team had promised the financial community that it \nwould offset that equity issuance by buying back stock in order to \nmaintain a roughly flat number of shares outstanding.  \nThe issue was that the CEO perceived that his company\u2019s stock, \nlevitated by the dot-com boom, was overvalued. He had painted \nhimself into a corner, and the question was whether he should \ncontinue to buy back stock at a premium to maintain his pledge, \nor limit buybacks and allow the number of shares outstanding to \nrise. \nIn the 2023 annual report of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, \nthe company\u2019s chairman and CEO, wrote, \u201cAll stock repurchases \nshould be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to \nbusiness-value becomes stupid if done at a premium.\u201d1 \nThe simple goal of capital allocation is to buy low and sell high. \nBuying low means giving less than you receive, and selling high \nmeans receiving more than you give. The distinction between \nprice and value is crucial. Price is what you pay or receive. Value, \nfor assets that generate cash, is the present value of future cash \nflows. Companies create value when they acquire an asset at a \nprice below its value or sell an asset at a price above its value. \nPublic companies issue and retire equity. The main reasons to \nissue equity are to finance an acquisition, compensate \nemployees, fund operations, and change the mix of debt and \nequity in the company\u2019s capital structure. Retiring equity returns \ncapital to the selling shareholders. Buybacks may achieve \nadditional perceived benefits including signaling the shares are \nundervalued, reducing the risk of misallocating cash, increasing \nearnings per share, and offsetting the dilution from SBC.2 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

What is wise at one price \nmay be unwise at another.  \nFrom time to time, analysts publish research listing the companies that were the best at buying back stock. They \ncalculate this using total shareholder returns after the buyback. The presumption is that the companies \nintentionally repurchased shares that were undervalued.  \nBut that research often fails to note that a subset of those companies also issued equity, commonly in the form \nof SBC. If executives have a view that price differs from value, and they both issue and retire stock, one of those \nactions fails the goal of capital allocation (see exhibit 1).3 Which one is it? \nExhibit 1: Hard to Add Value While Issuing and Retiring Equity Simultaneously \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nMost executives say they want to create shareholder value, yet suffer little or no cognitive dissonance as they \nissue and buy back stock at the same time. \nMost fundamental investors consider the capital allocation skills of management in their investment process. \nThey also value the business either directly by assessing the present value of future cash flows or indirectly \nusing a valuation multiple. But few investors explicitly consider the wealth transfers that a company can cause \nwhen it issues or retires stock that is mispriced. \nThis report is about companies that both issue and retire shares simultaneously or within a short period of time. \nWe will examine the reasons companies say they issue and buy back stock. We then segregate U.S. public \ncompanies into those that are above and below the median in issuance via SBC, as well as those that are above \nand below the median in share buybacks. This sorting creates a two by two grid that allows us to examine the \ntotal shareholder returns in each of the quadrants. \nThe audience for this report is boards of directors and executives who think carefully about capital allocation, as \nwell as investors who want to assess those skills among the companies they evaluate. \n \nIssue equity\nAdds value for \nongoing shareholders \nwhen overvalued\nRetire equity\nAdds value for \nongoing shareholders \nwhen undervalued\nIssue and retire equity\nHow does it add value?\n"

All rights reserved. \n3726719 Exp 7/31/2025 \n3\n \n \nWealth Transfers \nLots of academic research shows that companies are good at timing the issuance and retirement of equity. On \naverage, they buy low (price below value) and sell high (price above value).4 This creates wealth transfers.  \nWhen a company buys back undervalued stock, wealth is transferred from the sellers to the ongoing holders. \nWhen a company sells overvalued stock, wealth is transferred from the buyers to the ongoing holders. \nEmpirically, less wealth is transferred through buybacks than through equity issuance.5 Institutional investors \nare generally more astute than individual investors when transacting with a company.6 \nThe implications for action or inaction are different for ongoing shareholders in cases when a company is buying \nundervalued stock or selling overvalued stock. If a company buys undervalued stock, a shareholder doing \nnothing increases his or her stake while value per share rises. If a company sells overvalued stock, the value \nper share also increases for ongoing holders but, of course, that shareholder is better off selling alongside \nmanagement. \nA stock\u2019s time-weighted average return can be different than its dollar-weighted return as a consequence of \nthese wealth transfers.7 Time-weighted returns consider stock price change and dividends over some period. \nDollar-weighted returns incorporate stock price change and dividends but also include the inflows and outflows \nassociated with issuance or retirement of equity. \nTotal shareholder return is a time-weighted return. But since issuance and retirement change a company\u2019s equity \ncapitalization, dollar-weighted returns can be a lot different than time-weighted returns if the company buys or \nsells mispriced stock.    \nConsider a firm that has 1,000 shares outstanding that trade at $100 per share for a market capitalization of \n$100,000. The stock then doubles and the company issues an additional 1,000 shares, raising the market cap \nto $400,000 (2,000 x $200). The shares then go back to $100 for a market cap of $200,000.  \nThe original shareholders who did not transact are flat. But those who bought shares at $200 have lost one-half \nof their money. The time-weighted return is zero, assuming no dividend, because the stock ended where it \nbegan. But the dollar-weighted return, calculated using the internal rate of return (IRR), is -26.8 percent. \nNow think of a company that has 1,000 shares outstanding that trade at $100, but the stock drops to $50. This \ntime, the company buys 500 shares. Assuming the stock reverts to its prior price of $100, the ongoing holders \nare flat and the company, should it reissue the shares, would double its money. The time-weighted return is zero \nbut the dollar-weighted return is 13.3 percent. \nIdeally, investors want to find companies that trigger wealth transfers that benefit long-term ongoing holders. \nThese are the companies that can methodically discern gaps between price and value and reliably act on them.   \n \n \n \n \n"

Over this period, equity issuance was $9.7 trillion, with equity-financed merger \nand acquisition (M&A) deals making up 58 percent of the total, followed by stock-based compensation (SBC) at \n22 percent, and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) at 20 percent. SEOs are new shares that are issued to \ninvestors that are not initial public offerings (IPOs). \nNote that the Financial Accounting Standards Board did not require companies to disclose SBC on the income \nstatement until 2006, which means this total of equity issuance is modestly understated. \nExhibit 2: Equity Issuance for M&A, SBC, and SEOs in the U.S., 2000-2023 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Includes companies on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and NYSE American stock exchanges. \nThe main factors that executives consider when they decide to issue equity include the perceived difference \nbetween the price and value of the stock, potential dilution in earnings per share, the provision for SBC, and \nreaching or maintaining a target capital structure.8 \nM&A. In the 25 years ended in 2023, companies funded a majority of M&A deals with cash. But enough deals \nare financed with equity that it is the leading reason for overall issuance. Among the best known of these was \nthe merger between America Online (AOL) and Time Warner Inc. That deal was announced in January 2000, \nnear the peak of the dot-com boom. The executives presented the transaction as a merger of equals but Time \nWarner was four times larger than AOL based on trailing annual sales. AOL offered more than $150 billion in \nequity to buy Time Warner, and AOL shareholders ended up with 55 percent of the combined entity.9 The tie-up \nhas been described as \u201cthe worst merger of all time.\u201d10  \nM&A deals financed with equity allow buyers to preserve cash, avoid debt, or do deals larger than their debt \ncapacity would allow.

For example, from October 2023 to May 2024, three major \noil companies in the U.S. announced acquisitions financed with equity that had a combined value of almost $130 \nbillion. The preference of the sellers for tax-free deals was an important factor in the payment method. \nRemarkably, these same companies bought back a combined total of nearly $75 billion of stock in 2022 and \n2023. \nAcademic studies show that the shareholders of companies that do deals with stock fare substantially worse \nthan those of companies that do deals with cash.11 The thinking is that companies issue equity when they \nconsider it to be overvalued. This does not mean that stock deals are inherently bad, but executives and \ninvestors must verify that such deals make economic sense. \nWarren Buffett has said he is chary of issuing equity. But in June 1998, he pledged about 20 percent of Berkshire \nHathaway\u2019s shares to acquire General Re, a multinational property and casualty reinsurance company.12 \nNotably, from the beginning of January 1997 to the announcement of the deal, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Class B \nstock was up 143 percent versus a gain for the S&P 500 of 52 percent. The S&P 500 is an index of approximately \n500 U.S. stocks with the largest market capitalizations.  \nGeneral Re had a number of operational issues that took Berkshire some years to fix. But even after addressing \nGeneral Re\u2019s problems, Buffett called it \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d to issue so many shares to buy the business. He \nadded, \u201cMy error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received.\u201d13  \nThe difference between price and value is an important consideration in determining what to pay in a deal \nfinanced with stock. Say a company determines that the maximum it can pay for a target is $50 per share and \nthat the value of its own stock is $100 per share. If the buyer\u2019s value and price are the same, it can offer 0.50 \nshares and the deal is neutral to value.  \nIf the buyer\u2019s stock price is $150, it can offer 0.33 shares and add value for its shareholders because paying \nwith overvalued stock means lower dilution. Similarly, if the buyer\u2019s stock price is $50, it has to offer 1.0 shares, \nwhich destroys value for the buyer\u2019s ongoing stockholders.  \nWhen surveyed, 50 to 80 percent of financial executives typically say they believe the stock price of their \ncompany is below its fair value.14 A company can do a deal using equity financing when its stock is undervalued. \nBut the ratio of the target\u2019s price to value has to be equal to or lower than the ratio of the buyer\u2019s price to value \nfor it to be neutral or additive to shareholder value.  \nThe target\u2019s value is the maximum price the buyer should be willing to pay, and it generally includes a premium \nfor control that reflects anticipated synergies. Such discounts in price to value are unlikely in an active market \nfor corporate control. \nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation has been the second largest source of equity \nissuance in the last quarter century. Exhibit 3 shows SBC as a percent of sales for companies in the Russell \n3000, an index that measures the performance of roughly 3,000 U.S. stocks and represents nearly all of the \ninvestable equity market. That percentage went from 0.2 of sales in 2006 to 1.3 of sales in 2023. The compound \nannual growth rate was 15.3 percent for SBC and 3.8 percent for sales. The dollar sum of SBC rose from $26 \nbillion in 2006 to $290 billion in 2023. \n \n"

Dilution lowers the percentage ownership of existing \nshareholders and is calculated as one minus the shares outstanding before issuance divided by the shares \noutstanding after issuance. For example, the holders of a firm with 1,000 shares outstanding realize about 9.1 \npercent dilution when the company issues 100 new shares, as they now own 90.9 percent of the company (1 \u2013 \n[1,000/1,100] = 1 - 0.909 = 0.091). \nThe companies in the smallest two deciles have median three-year dilution that is relatively high at 8.5 percent \n(exhibit 5). The median dilution for firms in the largest two deciles is negative, which means that shareholders \nwho do not sell increase their percentage ownership between one and four percent. Again, the stylized fact is \nthat dilution falls, and is eventually negative, as companies grow larger.  \nExhibit 5: Three-Year Dilution of Shareholders by Decile for the Russell 3000, 2021-2023 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global.  \nNote: Data for calendar years; Universe and deciles based on 12/31/2023; Minimum sales of $100 million; Medians. \nModeling the impact of SBC on corporate value is tricky. There are two basic approaches that get to the same \nanswer in theory.19 The first treats SBC as an expense on the income statement, as accounting rules stipulate, \nand does not adjust future shares outstanding for stock the company has not issued. The second adds back \nSBC to cash flow, as is done in the statement of cash flows, and adjusts future shares outstanding to reflect the \ndilution from SBC.  \nThe most common definition of free cash flow that investors and companies use, cash flow from operations \nminus capital expenditures, does not match the theoretical definition in finance and requires anticipating \ndilution.20 The data in exhibit 5 provide useful reference classes for that modeling. \nStock-based compensation, especially for executives, seeks to satisfy three goals that can be difficult to \nbalance.21 The first is to create proper incentives for employees to create value. Research suggests that SBC \ncan incentivize executives yet has a limited effect on the rank and file.22 The strength of the incentives can vary \nbased on employee age and tenure.23 \nThe second objective is to retain employees. Note that compensation is only one of the factors that determines \nretention.

Paying employees well can be consistent with \nmaximizing shareholder value.  \nEmployees and shareholders are aligned when SBC creates a proper incentive. This is one of the virtues of pay \npackages in private equity buyout deals.27 The level of executive compensation is generally tied to shareholder \nreturns, and shareholders who have fared well rarely have qualms about executive pay.28 \nBut wealth transfers between shareholders and employees can occur if the price of the stock differs from its \nvalue. For instance, issuing undervalued stock for SBC transfers wealth from ongoing shareholders to \nemployees. Issuing overvalued stock transfers wealth from employees to ongoing shareholders.  \nThe risk of misalignment arises when companies use SBC as a pay delivery system versus an incentive \ncompensation program. This happens when a company issues additional shares to replenish pay to former or \npledged levels following poor stock performance.29 For instance, in 2022 the Russell 3000 Index was down 19 \npercent and total SBC was up 19 percent. \nExhibit 6 shows that the stocks of the companies in the top 20 percent of SBC as a percent of sales produced \nsubstantially lower excess stock price returns than those companies in the bottom 20 percent. These data cover \na period from July 2007 to December 2018. This does not mean that the SBC levels caused the excess returns, \nbut the result is consistent with the point that equity issuance often portends subpar future returns. \nExhibit 6: SBC to Sales and Future Excess Returns, July 2007 to December 2018 \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global and Partha Mohanram, Brian White, and Wuyang Zhao, \u201cStock-Based Compensation, Financial \nAnalysts, and Equity Overvaluation,\u201d Review of Accounting Studies, Vol. 25, No. 3, September 2020, 1040-1077. \n-0.25\n-0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nFuture Excess Monthly Returns (Percent)\nQuintile Based on Stock-Based Compensation to Sales (1=Least, 5=Most) \n"

Intrinsic employee motivation, promoted by a sense \nof autonomy, mastery, and purpose, does a better job of predicting worker performance than pay does.30 The \neffectiveness of SBC is also limited because shareholders with diversified portfolios are generally risk neutral \nwhereas employees are commonly risk averse. As a result, equity is more valuable to shareholders than \nworkers. For employees, equity is correlated with human capital and therefore reduces diversification, is not \nliquid, and can be difficult to value. \nEmployees who are given a choice of the form of pay often prefer cash to stock. For example, Netflix, a \nsubscription video service, put into place a compensation arrangement, finalized in 2006, whereby eligible \nemployees could request a mix of cash and stock for the following year. About 60 to 75 percent of employees \nrequested all cash.31 In late 2022, Shopify, a multinational e-commerce company, launched a similar program \ncalled \u201cFlex Comp.\u201d It was reported that a popular choice among software engineers was to get \u201call or most of \ntheir compensation in cash,\u201d a data point supported by the fact that the total value of restricted stock units that \nShopify granted in 2023 was less than one-third of what it was in 2022.32 \nSeasoned Equity Offerings. SEOs are a third form of equity issuance. Consistent with the finding that \ncompanies tend to be good at buying low and selling high, the research shows companies that do SEOs have \nsubpar stock returns, on average, following the deal.33 But introducing other considerations refines this broad \nconclusion.  \nFor example, a company\u2019s motivation to do an SEO is relevant. There are three reasons firms cite to justify a \ndeal: to recapitalize the balance sheet (increasing the ratio of equity to debt); to fund an investment; and for \n\u201cgeneral corporate purpose,\u201d a catchall for any action. The research shows that the stocks of the companies that \nissue stock earmarked for recapitalizing the balance sheet or for general corporate purposes underperform the \nmarket. Companies that do an SEO for a specific investment do not underperform.34   \nWho buys the SEO is also relevant. Institutional investors tend to be more savvy than individual investors.35 \nSEOs with large institutional allocations outperform those without those allocations.36 This pattern is also evident \nin IPOs and trading.37 \nReasons Companies Retire Equity \nU.S. public companies retired $14.0 trillion of equity from 2000 to 2023 (see exhibit 7). There is net retirement \nof equity because small companies tend to issue equity and large companies generally retire equity.38 In this \ncentury, U.S. public companies have funded their growth largely with cash from operations. There was also a \nsmall contribution from an increase in debt. Buybacks have been substantial in the last 25 years but remain \ncontroversial.39 \nIdeally, companies would pay attention to Warren Buffett and buy back shares only when their price is below \ntheir value. Some companies are good at this, and the evidence suggests that buybacks modestly benefit \nongoing shareholders in the aggregate.40 The size and method of buybacks can also provide insight into the \nstrength of the potential signal of undervaluation.41 \nBut in reality many companies decide to buy back stock because they have excess cash, want to offset dilution \nfrom SBC, and seek to boost earnings per share (EPS).42 The motivation to increase EPS flies in the face of \nfinance theory and empirical research.43  \n"

This problem describes the conflict \nbetween the objectives of principals and agents. In this case, shareholders are the principals and executives are \nthe agents. Agency costs are actions that harm principals and benefit agents.  \nBuybacks can mitigate or create agency costs.46 They reduce them when a company returns excess cash to \ninvestors and, as a result, does not squander the capital on investments with low returns or perquisites for \nexecutives.47 But they create agency costs when they are deployed to benefit executives or to show superficial \nresults without creating value.48  \nFor instance, recent research points to a causal link between higher SBC and greater buyback activity with the \nintent to offset dilution. Many companies that buy back stock do so frequently, which limits their ability to time \nthe market.49 And there appears to be a positive correlation between buybacks and sales of equity holdings by \nexecutives.50 \nThe lag between issuance and retirement can be relevant for companies seeking to manage dilution in shares \noutstanding. Most SBC vests over time, commonly four years. If stock issued at the grant date rises over the \nvesting period, the price paid to retire shares in order to offset dilution will exceed the original cost to issue the \nshares.51 \n \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nBuybacks ($ Billions)\n"

Overall, companies are \nreasonably good at this. One way to think about it is that firms increase supply by issuing shares when prices \nare too high and increase demand by retiring shares when prices are too low.52 \nThere is a great deal of evidence that issuing stock in an M&A deal or an SEO is often a predictor of poor \nsubsequent shareholder returns for the issuer. But this is not a blanket observation. Under certain conditions an \nequity-financed acquisition or an SEO can make sound economic sense. In other words, there are cases when \na company can issue shares that are at fair value, or even undervalued, if they fetch a stream of cash flows that \ncompensates for that parity or discount. \nWe now focus more closely on SBC and buybacks, in part because the motivation for buybacks is related to the \nshare issuance associated with SBC.  \nIn theory, SBC should provide an incentive for employees to work effectively, be a mechanism to retain workers, \nand balance the interests of employees and shareholders.  \nIn practice, SBC meets those objectives with varying degrees of success from one company to the next. Further, \nfor many companies SBC has evolved into a mechanism to pay employees a certain amount, disconnecting \ntheir outcomes from those of shareholders, and it appears heavily influenced by the institutional imperative to \nfollow the actions of peers and competitors.  \nIn theory, buybacks should add value to ongoing shareholders and provide them with an ability to time their tax \nliabilities.  \nIn practice, companies regularly tie the magnitude of their buyback programs to the dilution that SBC causes \nand look to buybacks as a means to manage EPS.   \nBecause practice can be at odds with theory, some companies issue and retire a meaningful amount of stock at \nthe same time.53 Yet research supports the idea that companies are the smart money, especially when they \nissue stock.54 This leads us to narrow our attention to the subset of companies that both issue and retire \nsignificant amounts of stock and ask how their shareholder returns stack up versus the rest of the market. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n3726719 Exp 7/31/2025 \n12\n \n \nSBC, Buybacks, and Total Shareholder Returns \nFor this analysis, we start with the Russell 3000 universe and consider the stocks of companies with a minimum \nof $1 billion of sales. For each year from 2021 to 2023, we calculate issuance as SBC divided by sales and \nretirement as gross buybacks divided by market capitalization. We include only companies that have these \nstatistics for at least one year. Our sample includes roughly 1,350 stocks. \nWe take the average of these issuance and retirement measures over the three years for each company, and \ncalculate the median of each metric for the universe. The median of SBC to sales is 0.8 percent and the median \nfor buybacks to market cap is 1.5 percent. We then divide the population into quadrants based on whether the \ncompany is below the median (low) or above the median (high) in each measure. We use the combinations to \ncalculate the average and median annual TSRs for each quadrant for the 3 years through December 31, 2023. \nThe results are in exhibit 8. The stocks of companies that were below the median on SBC issuance and above \nthe median on buybacks (upper right corner) delivered the highest TSRs over the period. Those below the \nmedian in issuance and retirement (upper left corner) had the second-highest TSRs. \nExhibit 8: Annual TSRs for Companies with Low and High SBC and Buybacks, 2021-2023 \n \nAverage TSR \nBuybacks Low \nBuybacks High \nSBC Low \n9.4% \n13.7% \nSBC High \n-0.1% \n5.3% \n \n \nMedian TSR \nBuybacks Low \nBuybacks High \nSBC Low \n7.6% \n11.4% \nSBC High \n2.6% \n6.2% \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Includes companies in the Russell 3000 with minimum sales of $1 billion. \nThe stocks of companies that were above the median in issuance and retirement (bottom right corner) are the \nprimary group of interest. Their TSRs were the third highest. Finally, the stocks of companies that issued a lot \nof stock for compensation and bought few or no shares had the worst TSRs.   \nThe ranking based on the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, was in the same order as the average \nand median returns. The Russell 3000 Index rose at a compound annual rate of 8.5 percent over this period. \nWe ran this analysis for the 5 years ending in 2023 and found that the TSRs remained highest for the quadrant \n\u201cSBC low/buybacks high\u201d and lowest for \u201cSBC high/buybacks low.\u201d But the TSRs for the other quadrants flipped \norder, with \u201cSBC high/buybacks high\u201d outperforming \u201cSBC low/buybacks low.\u201d  \nTo be clear, these TSRs were likely driven by lots of factors that had nothing to do with equity issuance and \nretirement. These include changes in fundamentals and expectations, industry exposures, the impact of COVID, \nand interest rates. But executives and investors should understand what the empirical research shows about \nequity issuance and assess capital allocation decisions in that light. \n"

All rights reserved. \n3726719 Exp 7/31/2025 \n13\n \n \nConclusion \nCompanies that are successful at capital allocation over time buy low and sell high. Most capital allocation \ndecisions relate to a firm\u2019s operations and require determining the prospects for satisfactory returns on \ninvestments such as M&A, capital expenditures, and intangible investments. But companies can also trigger \nwealth transfers by buying and selling stock at prices below or above value. \nA company that buys back shares below value initiates a wealth transfer from selling shareholders to ongoing \nshareholders. Conversely, selling overvalued shares transfers wealth from buyers to ongoing holders. Academic \nresearch shows that companies do this effectively, although the magnitude of the transfer is smaller for \npurchases than sales.  \nFrom 2000 to 2023, public companies in the U.S. issued nearly $10 trillion in equity and retired just over $14 \ntrillion. Most of the issuance was to fund M&A, followed by SBC and seasoned equity offerings. \nIssuing equity is associated with poor subsequent returns for ongoing shareholders in the aggregate, but this \nresult is not definitive. For example, companies that issue equity earmarked to fund specific investments tend to \nhave better returns than those that issue for general corporate purposes. \nThe main reason companies say they buy back stock is to signal their stock is undervalued. But there is also \nevidence executives are very mindful of dilution due to SBC and the impact of buybacks on earnings per share.  \nOverall, ongoing shareholders of smaller companies realize dilution, a reduction in their percentage of \nownership, which means these companies issue more equity than they retire. Ongoing shareholders of large \ncompanies increase their ownership, on average, because these companies retire more equity than they issue. \nOur focus is on companies that issue and retire substantial amounts of equity either simultaneously or within a \nshort amount of time. If the stock price is any different than fair value, either issuing or retiring equity is suboptimal \nfrom the point of view of ideal capital allocation.  \nWe examine the total shareholder returns from 2021 to 2023 for the stocks of the companies based on their \nissuance and retirement of equity. We separate the population into quadrants based on whether the companies \nare above or below the median for issuance and retirement. We measure issuance as SBC divided by sales and \nretirement as gross buybacks divided by market capitalization. \nWe find that companies with low SBC issuance and high buybacks delivered the highest average and median \nTSRs of the groups. Firms with high SBC and low buybacks produced the lowest returns. Returns for the stocks \nof companies that were high in SBC and buybacks had the third highest returns. We would hasten to add that \nnumerous causes that had nothing to do with equity issuance were probably important in driving these TSRs.  \nThis discussion should be helpful for boards of directors, executives, and investors who seek to think carefully \nabout capital allocation. From an investor\u2019s point of view, the returns for the stocks of companies issuing stock \nhave been substandard, and the returns have been attractive for those that retire stock, on average. Those \nsignals cross for companies that issue and retire stock at the same time. Presuming that executives can \ndistinguish between stock price and value because they have better information than investors do, either issuing \nor retiring fails to meet the central goal of capital allocation.55 Which one is it? \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 18-20 \n"
