      "text": "Thoughts On Valuation II\n31 May 2001\n2\nAn Epistemological View of Valuation\nWhether the stock market is booming or swooning, valuation is an integral part of\nfundamental analysis. Yet investors generally discuss valuation on a very superficial\nlevel. Valuation discussions, if they can be so termed, usually surround which rule-of-\nthumb (e.g., price/earnings multiple) to use and the appropriate level of that rule of\nthumb (e.g., the P/E should be 24). Here we attempt to address some of the harder\nissues surrounding valuation. In particular, we seek to answer some basic questions:\n\u2022 What is the central role of valuation?\n\u2022 What can we say, and not say, about the certainty of the valuation process?\n\u2022 What analogies can help us understand how the market sets price?\n\u2022 What does empirical evidence tell us?\n\u2022 Why isn\u2019t the theory accepted in practice?\nValuation defined\nInvesting entails committing money today in order to gain a future financial return.\nValuation is the mechanism by which investors trade cash today for future claims on\ncash flows. Investment industry luminary John Bogle says it more eloquently: \u201cThe\npurpose of any stock market\u2026is simply to provide liquidity for stocks in return for the\npromise of future cash flows, enabling investors to realize the present value of a future\nstream of income at any time.\u201d\nThis simple point is packed: it tells us that the combination of price (for a publicly traded\nsecurity) and the valuation mechanism provide potentially useful insights about the\nmarket\u2019s expectations for magnitude, timing, and riskiness of future cash flows.\nA brief diversion: it is important to clearly understand the distinction between price and\nvalue. Price reflects the collective expectations of investors. Value, if it is to be logically\ndistinct from price, implies that an investor believes something different than what the\nmarket believes. In order for investors to have a firm grasp on where and why their\nviews are different than the market, it is important that they understand where the\nmarket stands.\nWhat do we know? What don\u2019t we know?\nAt the end of the day, we can prove very little about valuation. The reason is simple:\nstock prices (and the inputs that derive them) reflect investor expectations. Changes in\ninvestor expectations, in turn, largely dictate total shareholder returns. Investors often\nask whether a particular financial measure (insert your favorite\u2014cash flow, return on\ncapital, earnings) correlates strongly with total shareholder returns over a particular time\nperiod. The answer is generally a disappointing \u201cno\u201d, because no single financial\nmeasure can thoroughly capture a set of expectations. Any direct link between price a\nparticular financial measure is likely to be ephemeral.\nThink of it this way: We can best describe shareholder returns from time A to time B as\nthe change in expectations from time A to time B. And while a company\u2019s financial\nperformance during that time frame may influence the expectations set at time B, the\nmarket is always looking forward.\n"

      "text": "Thoughts On Valuation II\n31 May 2001\n3\nIf expectation revisions largely dictate stock price movements, is it possible to\nintelligently decipher those expectations? Or, more to the point, what expectations do\nstock prices reflect? Sales growth? Earnings? Cash flows?\nEven the most ardent finance theorist struggles with this answer. But scientists\nfrequently use a technique that applies here. When trying to understand a complicated\nsystem, scientists often start by looking for a similar, but simpler, system. Understanding\nof the simpler system can provide useful insights about the workings of the more\ncomplicated system.\nA scientific approach\nWant to understand human neuroscience? Start with the Caenorhabditis elegans, a\ncommon worm. Scientists have mapped all of c. elegans\u2019s 302 neurons, providing them\nwith the cellular basis of the neural computations that underlie behavior. Interested in\ngenetics? Turn to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Scientists decoded the complete genome\nof this common yeast years ago, allowing for a clearer understanding of gene action and\ninteraction. In both cases, the simpler system provides critical clues for how to think\ncorrectly about its more complicated counterpart.\nInvestors can do the same exercise to understand stock valuation. A simpler and\nanalogous system is the bond market. The bond market, just like the stock market,\nplaces a price today on a stream of future economic claims. But bond issuers, unlike\nequity issuers, are contractually obligated to make timely payments on their coupons\nand principal. As a result, bond market valuation is clear-cut: the value of a bond today\nis the present value of future cash flows. To value bonds, you need to answer three\nquestions:\n1. What will the cash flows be?\n2. When will I receive them?\n3. How risky are they?\nFor bonds, issuers must specify the answers to two of these three questions (magnitude\nand timing). Beyond the issue of defaulting on these obligations, the degree of risk and,\nhence, expected return is the primary issue for investors to weigh.\nIf indeed investors value bonds by discounting future cash flows, it stands to reason that\nthey value stocks\u2014a junior financial claim\u2014in the same fashion. However, there is a big\ndifference between stocks and bonds, because companies do not specify the timing and\nmagnitude of cash flows for stocks (even dividends are, at best, a quasi-contract). So\nanswering the three questions above is inherently more difficult. The whole valuation\nprocess is more uncertain. But this uncertainty does not obviate the basic mechanics of\nvaluation. It\u2019s all about the present value of free cash flow.\nJust the facts\nWe can now go one step further, and consider whether or not the empirical research\nsupports this observation. As it turns out, the evidence is quite clear. Specifically, we\ncan summarize the relevant elements of the literature in three statements:\n"

It is possible for companies to increase their reported earnings but not\nincrease shareholder value. This can occur when a company makes an incremental\ninvestment at a rate below the cost of capital. One example is an EPS-accretive\nacquisition that is net-present-value negative.\n2. There is a trade-off between risk and reward (i.e., high risk equals high reward, low\nrisk equals low reward). This relationship seems particularly pronounced across\nasset classes.\n3. The stock market reflects expectations for long-term cash flows. It often takes ten or\nmore years of future cash flows to justify a company\u2019s current stock price.\nBuilding on first principles, we can now strongly suggest that stock prices reflect\nexpectations for future long-term cash flows. While most investors do not find reason to\nquarrel with the above language, they may claim that the logic is theoretical. Since the\nreal world is a lot messier than the theory, the argument goes, investors have to back\naway from this theoretical approach.\nGood theory, limited practice\nSpecifically, the reasons investors fail to embrace a discounted cash flow model fall into\ntwo broad camps. The first is based on a distrust of a discounted cash flow model itself.\nThe argument is that certain inputs, such as the cost of capital and terminal value, are\ncritical from a practical standpoint (i.e., small changes in these variables lead to large\nvalue swings) but poorly specified from a theoretical perspective.\nThe second camp expresses skepticism about the ideal of discounted cash flow given\nthat most investors use multiples to determine value. More bluntly, this group asks, \u201chow\ncan the market \u2018get\u2019 discounted cash flow when so few investors actually use it?\u201d\nNeither objection holds up to careful scrutiny.\nThe retort to the first objection\u2014distrust of the model\u2014has two parts. To begin, practical\nhurdles do not undermine the logical case of how to value a stock. That the capital asset\npricing model is an imperfect representation of risk does not mean that an investor can\nneglect risk and reward. That our understanding of sustainable competitive advantage is\nincomplete does not mean that we can neglect a company\u2019s value growth duration.\nThere are ways to circumvent this garbage-in, garbage-out problem. The best, we\nbelieve, is to take the stock price and work backwards; reverse-engineering the\nexpectations needed to equate to the current price. This decoding of prices allows\ninvestors to read the mind of the market using the language of the market. Investors\nthan then intelligently judge whether or not the market is too optimistic or pessimistic.\nThe next response to discounted cash flow model distrust is to consider whether or not\nthere are viable alternatives. Most valuation work in the financial community is based on\nmultiples\u2014multiples of sales, EBITDA, earnings or book value. But investors must\nrecognize the simple fact that multiples are not valuation, multiples are a shorthand for\nthe valuation process. No investor should ever confuse the two.\nShorthands in general have the virtue of saving their users time. But shorthands are\nalso, by definition, more crude than the reality they seek to represent. That many\ninvestors are comfortable with multiples but uncomfortable with discounted cash flow\n"

As Keynes said, \u201cIt is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong.\u201d The\ndifficulty of creating a sound discounted cash flow model reflects the uncertainty\ninherent in corporate cash flows, not a flaw in the analytical approach.\nIn short, the practical challenges is using a discounted cash flow model do not weaken\nits theoretical and pragmatic value. Indeed, the alternatives to a discounted cash flow\nframework inevitably represent a step away from economic reality.\nThe second objection\u2014how the market \u201cgets it\u201d\u2014appears on the surface to be more\nprofound. It does not seem to make sense to assume that the market follows a\ndiscounted cash flow approach, either in theory or practice, if so few investors use the\nmodel. In the bond market, which we held up as analogous, investors really do use a\ndiscounted cash flow model. But for the stock market, detailed valuation approaches are\nthe exception, not the rule.\nThere are two possible responses to this objection. The first, while insufficient, is the\nstandard answer in finance circles. It is based on the idea that stock prices are set at the\nmargin. So average investors don\u2019t matter since they are price takers. Rather, the\nmarginal price setter is the key. As the theory goes, the marginal price setter (think\nWarren Buffett) indeed does use a discounted cash flow model. Since the marginal\nprice setter is effectively leading the other presumably less sophisticated investors,\nstock prices adhere to the discounted cash flow framework.\nThis approach has significant intuitive appeal and is sufficiently robust to persuade\nmany investors of the importance of using a discounted cash flow approach.\nUnfortunately, it rests on assumptions that are not realistic: the number of marginal price\nsetters and the capital they would require are too large to credibly suggest that they\ndictate stock market prices. Further, this model doesn\u2019t do an acceptable job explaining\nthe vagaries of the market\u2014periodic booms and busts that are inconsistent with\nstandard finance theory.\nThere is an alternative response that is more persuasive, and is a very important mental\nmodel. The response is based on the idea that the stock market is a complex adaptive\nsystem. We can describe complex adaptive systems\u2014which are ubiquitous in nature\u2014\nin three parts. First, there is a heterogeneous group of agents (investors, in this case),\neach with evolving decision rules that attempt to anticipate changes in their\nenvironment. Second, the interaction of these agents leads to self-organization\u2014often\ncalled emergence. Finally, the interaction creates a global system (the stock market)\nthat has properties and characteristics distinct from the underlying agents themselves.\nJust as you can\u2019t understand an ant colony by interviewing an ant, you can\u2019t understand\na stock market by interviewing an investor. There is no additivity. The sum is greater\nthan the parts. Price is a manifestation of myriad investment strategies, time horizons,\nand investment beliefs. And, as it turns out, we can say that the collective (i.e., the\nmarket) is consistently \u201csmarter\u201d than the average agent is.\nOne of the ways to appreciate why the market is so good is to distinguish between the\n\u201cproblem\u201d and the \u201csolution.\u201d The problem, in the case of the stock market, is how to\ndetermine the present value of future cash flows for all publicly traded companies. The\nsolution is a how investors go about their task\u2014a collage of technical and fundamental\ntacks.\n"

You are asked to\n\u201csolve\u201d the maze\u2014that is, to get from the Start to the Finish. That is the problem. How\nyou go about it is the \u201csolution\u201d. You might go at this in one of many ways. Your decision\nrule might be a little algorithm \u201ctwo lefts, one right, two lefts, one right, etc.\u201d or may be a\nbit less structured \u201cthis way looks good.\u201d And your decision rules are likely to evolve.\nThe important point is that the problem is easier to define than the solution.\nAs it turns out, scientists have actually done this maze experiment, and found that the\ncollective \u201cpath\u201d of a group of individuals with diverse decisions rules is consistently\nshorter\u2014that is, better\u2014than the average individual. Collective maze solving is more\neffective than individual maze solving.\nSo we can now see that the second objection to using the discounted cash flow model\nconfuses the problem with the solution. That investors use a diverse set of solutions in\nno way changes the problem. Indeed, diverse approaches help assure that individuals\nsolve the problem effectively. Further, it helps explain why empirical studies of the stock\nmarket show that it follows an economic model (collective problem solving) even though\nvery few individuals adhere to the pure economic approach (various decision rules).\nConclusion\nImagine strolling into a casino. Would you be willing to join a card game and wager your\nmoney, with a hope of winning, if you didn\u2019t completely understand the workings of the\ngame? Investors that lack a firm sense of valuation are in just such a set of\ncircumstances.\nValuation is important in fundamental analysis. Thoughtful investors have a firm grasp of\nthe market\u2019s mechanism, as well as well as what they can and can\u2019t know. We know\nthat many individual investors with different strategies interact through a market making\nmechanism, and that fluctuating prices result. Further, scientists have done experiments\nthat strongly suggest that the collective derives a better answer than the average\nindividual. But given that stock prices are a function of expectations, there is no\nobjective way to determine \u201cright\u201d answer.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager or co-manager\nof a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies mentioned.\n"
