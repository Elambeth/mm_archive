The headline was, \u201cAmazon\u2019s empire.\u201d An article in \nthe issue had a title that asked, \u201cAre investors too optimistic about \nAmazon?\u201d1 The stock would go on to appreciate 37.8 percent \nannually in the next four years versus a total shareholder return of \n15.8 percent for the S&P 500 Index. That growth translated into an \nincrease in market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. \nThe body of the article cites an analyst who forecasted that \nAmazon would grow its sales at a 16 percent compound annual \nrate through 2025. Of note, Amazon\u2019s total sales were $136 billion \nin 2016, suggesting the company\u2019s sales at the end of the period \nwould be $517 billion.  \nThe same paragraph mentions work that we did in 2016 revealing \nthat no company with $100 billion or more in base year sales had \never grown at that mid-teens rate for that long.2 Our data were from \n1950-2015 and reflected sales figures unadjusted for acquisitions \nand divestitures but adjusted for inflation. The analysis was not \nspecific to any particular business, but the clear implication was \nthat it was improbable that a company that big could grow that fast.  \nAmazon will be at a $515 billion-plus sales run rate by the second \nquarter of 2022 and will have a 6-year sales growth rate ended \n2022 of 27.6 percent, if the consensus estimates are accurate. That \ngrowth rate is more than 11 percentage points above the analyst\u2019s \nseemingly \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d view. If achieved, Amazon\u2019s results will \nrecast the base rate data. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n5780763 Exp. 06/30/2024 \n2 \n \nTwo Ways to Make a Forecast \nThere are broadly two ways to make a forecast, which is really a judgment about the future.3 The first method is \nto think causally, which is called taking the inside view. You gather lots of information about what is of interest, \ncombine it with your own input and experience, and project into the future. Analyst models are a good example \nof this approach. The analyst studies a company\u2019s businesses and projects sales and operating profit margins \nbased on a combination of macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and the company\u2019s competitive position.  \nCausal thinking is a form of storytelling that comes naturally. It is a compelling way to anticipate the future and \na convincing way to explain the past. Our minds are great at creating facile narratives to explain what happens \nin the world around us.       \nThe second method is to think statistically, commonly referred to as the outside view. Rather than weaving a \nstory based on causal links, the statistical approach examines what happened to an appropriate reference class \nof cases in the past. The results of the reference class are called base rates. Now the analyst builds her model \nnot by seeking causal links but rather by asking, \u201chow did other companies perform that were in a similar position \nto the one I am studying?\u201d Instead of relying on your own experience, you tap the experience of others.    \nThis type of thinking is unnatural because it features statistics rather than stories. Further, base rates may not \nbe readily available. But research shows that a thoughtful combination of the inside and outside views leads to \nmore accurate forecasts.4  \nOne of the keys to using base rates effectively is finding an appropriate reference class. In many instances, the \ndistribution of outcomes is straightforward. In these cases, the outcomes don\u2019t fall too far from the average, and \noutliers are rare. Measures of corporate results, such as sales growth rates, generally fit into this camp. Base \nrates are very effective for assessing outcomes that follow, or resemble, a bell-shaped distribution.    \nIn other instances, the distribution of outcomes has a variance that is large, the concept of an average is \nmeaningless, and outliers skew the results.5 For example, most books, songs, and movies have very modest \nsales while only a handful are blockbusters. Base rates are more difficult to apply, but knowledge of the \ndistribution itself is very useful. In our experience, underutilization of base rates is a bigger problem than \noverutilization of them.  \nOne important point to bear in mind is that outcomes of a proper reference class can change over time.6 That \nAmazon\u2019s sales growth is on pace to be greater than anything we have seen in the past 70 years proves the \npoint. That means that base rates can be very instructive but are not the final word. Indeed, there is reason to \nbelieve that some measures of corporate performance are shifting because the nature of business has changed. \nGrowth Rates in a World of Intangible Assets \nThe basic way that companies grow is by earning a return on investments. Return is measured by profits, which \nare the product of sales and margins. Investments can be tangible or intangible assets. Tangible assets are \nthings you can touch and feel, such as factories, trucks, and machines. Intangible assets lack a physical \nexistence and include software, the secret recipe for Coca-Cola, and the formulation of a life-saving drug.  \nOne important distinction between corporate tangible and intangible assets is access. Only one company can \nuse a tangible asset at a time, whereas many can use an intangible asset at the same time.7 In reality, the \n"

But the main point is that the marginal cost of sharing an \nintangible asset can be very low.  \nIntangible assets have two characteristics that are important for considering corporate growth rates.8 The first is \nthat they can enjoy strong economies of scale because they are commonly cheap to reproduce and share. \nEconomies of scale are a measure of cost per unit as a function of output. Think of software as an example. The \noriginal code may be very expensive to produce but the cost per unit sold drops rapidly because it is inexpensive \nto share. That is the good news. \nThe second is obsolescence and the related concept of sunkenness. The value of intangible assets can drop \nprecipitously when a new and better version comes along and makes the old version obsolete. And because the \nold version has very limited value, the investment cost is sunk. Let\u2019s continue with our example of software. \nOnce a company introduces a new operating system for a computer or mobile phone, the old one is of little \nrelevance or value. That is the bad news. \nThese characteristics highlight the contrast between tangible and intangible assets that are relevant for growth \nrates. Intangible assets are more scalable than tangible assets. That means successful companies that rely on \nintangible assets can grow faster than companies built on tangible assets. As the overall mix of investments \nshifts from tangible to intangible, we should expect to see faster growth rates for the winners than we have seen \nin the base rate data. \nOn the other hand, obsolescence means that companies that rely on intangible assets can decline more rapidly \nthan those built on tangible assets. Intangible assets are rarely standard, unlike tangible assets, which means \nthey have limited salvage value. A company with obsolete software cannot get much for it while a company with \na failed store can recoup some value by selling inventory and furnishings. This means that we should also expect \nto see slower growth rates, or a greater rate of decline, for the losers than the base rate data reflect.          \nThese observations about growth rates are important because overall investment spending has shifted in recent \ndecades from being predominately tangible to intangible. We estimate that intangible investments for companies \nin the Russell 3000, which captures the vast majority of the investable U.S. equity market, was around $1.8 \ntrillion in 2020. This is more than double the $800 billion those companies spent on capital expenditures.  \nThis discussion suggests two hypotheses that we can test. The first is that intangible-based businesses can \ngrow faster than what the base rate data show. In essence, the right tail of the distribution of growth rates is \nextending outward from the average. Amazon\u2019s results provide anecdotal evidence for this. \nThe second is that we should observe greater variance in the distribution of growth rates for intangible-based \nbusinesses. That means that the left tail of the distribution of growth rates is also spreading further from the \naverage. BlackBerry\u2019s 26.7 percent average annual revenue decline in the past decade through February 2021 \nis a case in point.  \nThis provides investors with good and bad news. The good news is there will be some businesses that grow in \nexcess of what history would suggest, creating opportunity. The bad news is some businesses will lose their \npositions of prominence and decline more rapidly than their predecessors did. Base rates remain extremely \ninformative, but we must have the mental flexibility to acknowledge how the population of companies has \nchanged over time.      \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5780763 Exp. 06/30/2024 \n4 \n \nBase Rates Based on Intangible Asset Intensity  \nTo test these ideas, we first need to sort the companies based on their intangible asset intensity. In a recent \npaper, three finance professors built a model to infer the value of intangible assets by examining market prices \nand merger and acquisition (M&A) deals.9 High market prices relative to stated book values suggest a failure to \nrecognize some intangible assets. When one company acquires another, the acquirer\u2019s accountants have to \nrecord the difference between the purchase price and tangible assets as goodwill or intangible assets. Using \npopular measures of knowledge and organizational capital as a benchmark, they found that the M&A data did a \nbetter job of estimating the value of intangible assets than did the market price technique. \nThe professors applied the M&A method to a large sample of companies from 1978-2017 to figure out where \nintangible asset intensity was highest. They found that the order of ranking from highest to lowest by industry \nwas healthcare, technology, consumer, and manufacturing. They also placed about one-third of the companies \ninto an \u201cother\u201d category because they didn\u2019t fit neatly into one of the industries.  \nWe calculated the median sales growth rate for companies in each of those categories using the constituents of \nthe Russell 3000 from 1984-2020. We also examined the standard deviation, a measure of the dispersion, of \nthe distributions. Exhibit 1 shows the results for the full sample. \nExhibit 1: Base Rates for Sales Growth by Industry, 1984-2020 \n \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Constituents of the Russell 3000 Index as of year-end; growth rates are based on nominal sales; CAGR=compound \nannual growth rate. \nThe sales growth rates, measured either as the median or average, consistently go from highest for companies \nthat are most intangible-asset intentive to lowest for those that are least intensive. While the short-term numbers \nare noisy, the relationship holds true over 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods. Consider the median compound annual \nsales growth rates over five-year periods. Growth was 10.4 percent for healthcare, 7.9 percent for technology, \n6.0 percent for consumer, and 5.0 percent for manufacturing. The median across all companies was 6.5 percent. \nThis supports the first hypothesis. \nThe standard deviation of the growth rates follows the same pattern. Where intangible asset intensity is high, \nthe standard deviation is also high. Assuming these distributions are normally distributed, an imperfect but \nillustrative assumption, about two-thirds of healthcare companies had 5-year sales growth rates between -18.0 \nand 43.2 percent. The comparable figures for manufacturing companies were -7.0 and 19.2 percent. This is \nconsistent with the second thesis.        \nTo capture the potential impact of size, we broke the universe into seven bins based on starting year sales. A \ncouple of patterns emerge. The first is that the average and median sales growth rates and standard deviations \ntend to decline as companies get bigger. This replicates a finding that has been established empirically.10 The \nIndustry\n1-yr\n3-yr\n5-yr\n10-yr\n1-yr\n3-yr\n5-yr\n10-yr\n1-yr\n3-yr\n5-yr\n10-yr\nHealthcare\n11.5%\n10.8%\n10.4%\n9.3%\n52.6%\n16.8%\n12.6%\n9.3%\n406.3%\n45.9%\n30.6%\n22.5%\nTechnology\n9.7%\n8.4%\n7.9%\n7.2%\n15.4%\n10.6%\n9.0%\n7.3%\n49.0%\n21.9%\n16.5%\n13.0%\nAll\n7.4%\n6.9%\n6.5%\n6.2%\n16.6%\n9.5%\n8.0%\n6.7%\n177.3%\n23.2%\n16.4%\n12.0%\nConsumer\n6.9%\n6.4%\n6.0%\n5.9%\n13.5%\n8.9%\n7.7%\n6.6%\n164.7%\n18.8%\n13.9%\n9.5%\nManufacturing\n5.4%\n5.1%\n5.0%\n5.5%\n9.3%\n6.8%\n6.1%\n6.0%\n50.4%\n17.5%\n13.1%\n9.4%\nOther\n7.6%\n7.3%\n6.9%\n6.3%\n16.2%\n9.6%\n8.1%\n6.6%\n194.5%\n22.5%\n15.8%\n12.2%\nMedian CAGR\nMean CAGR\nStandard Deviation\n"

(See the appendix for more detail.)  \nThe global pandemic in 2020 was a substantial challenge for global health and economic growth. One silver \nlining was the ability of digital companies, built largely on intangible assets, to thrive in the chaos. We examined \nthe sales growth rates of the companies in the Russell 1000, the largest one thousand companies in the U.S., \nto see which companies fared well. Healthcare and technology, the industries with the highest intangible asset \nintensity, represented over 60 percent of the top 20, 50, and 100 growers despite being only 29 percent of the \nuniverse (see exhibit 2).  \nExhibit 2: Intangible Asset-Intense Industries Among the Fastest Growers in 2020 \nIndustry \nTop 20 \nTop 50 \nTop 100 \nFull Index \nHealthcare \n8 \n12 \n22 \n81 \nTechnology \n5 \n19 \n42 \n203 \nConsumer \n4 \n8 \n15 \n189 \nManufacturing \n1 \n2 \n3 \n192 \nOther \n2 \n9 \n18 \n327 \nTotal \n20 \n50 \n100 \n992 \nHealthcare + Technology, Number \n13 \n31 \n64 \n284 \nHealthcare + Technology, Percent of Total \n65% \n62% \n64% \n29% \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Includes companies with sales data for calendar years 2019 and 2020. \nConclusion \nAccurate forecasts combine causal and statistical thinking in proper measure. Statistical thinking relies on \nidentifying an appropriate reference class of past outcomes. An overreliance on base rates can lead to faulty \nforecasts if the statistical properties of a reference class change over time. That said, we believe that forecasters \ndon\u2019t use base rates as frequently as they should. \nCompanies grow by generating a return on investment. The nature of investment has changed markedly in \nrecent decades, from one dominated by tangible assets to one mostly in the form of intangible assets. Intangible \nassets have some characteristics that distinguish them from tangible assets, including greater potential \neconomies of scale and higher risk of obsolescence. The good news is that intangible-intensive companies can \ngrow faster than their tangible counterparts. The bad news is they can also become irrelevant and shrink fast.  \nAs a consequence, we should see two effects in the data: higher growth and more dispersion in the outcomes. \nOur analysis of the results from companies in the Russell 3000 from 1984-2020 reveals both of these. The base \nrate of sales growth is getting stretched from the average in both the positive and negative direction.  \nThere are two main lessons for investors. First, it is important to be mindful of the potential shift in the base rate \nas the result of the rise of intangibles. Second, skillful investors may be able to identify the companies that will \ngrow faster than expected, hence providing the potential for attractive returns.  \n \n \n"
