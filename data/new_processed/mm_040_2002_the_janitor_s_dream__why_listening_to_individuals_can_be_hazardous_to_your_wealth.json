      "text": "\u201cIn the existing sciences much of the emphasis over the past century or so has been on\nbreaking systems down to find their underlying parts, then trying to analyze these parts in as\nmuch detail as possible . . . But just how these components act together to produce even some\nof the most obvious features of the overall behavior we see has in the past remained an almost\ncomplete mystery.\u201d\nStephen Wolfram\nA New Kind of Science\nBeyond Newton\nWhere does consciousness come from? This question has bedeviled philosophers and\nscientists for centuries. We have cured diseases, put men on the moon, and probed many\ndetails of our physical world. Yet even the best thinkers today have difficulty defining\nconsciousness, let alone explaining it. Why have we had so much success in some scientific\nrealms and so little in others, like unveiling the mysteries of consciousness?\nNot all systems are alike, and we can\u2019t understand the workings of all systems on the same\nlevel. Let\u2019s start with the systems that we do understand. Many of science\u2019s triumphs over the\npast few centuries are rooted in Isaac Newton\u2019s principles. Newton\u2019s world is a mechanical one,\nwhere cause and effect are clear and systems follow universal laws. With sufficient\nunderstanding of a system\u2019s underlying components, we can predict precisely how the system\nwill behave.\nReductionism is the cornerstone of discovery in the Newtonian world, the basis for much of\nscience\u2019s breathtaking advance in the 17th-19th centuries. As scientist John Holland explains,\n\u201cThe idea is that you could understand the world, all of nature, by examining smaller and smaller\npieces of it. When assembled, the small pieces would explain the whole.\u201d1 In many systems,\nreductionism works brilliantly.\nBut reductionism has its limits. In systems that rely on complex interaction of many components,\nthe whole system often has properties and characteristics that are distinct from the aggregation\nof the underlying components. Since the whole of the system emerges from the interaction of\nthe components, we cannot understand the whole simply by looking at the parts. Reductionism\nfails.\nNeuroscientist William Calvin, who is in the thick of the consciousness dialogue, notes that we\ncan approach the problem in various ways but that the key to understanding consciousness\ncertainly is not in the \u201cbasement\u201d of neural chemistry or the \u201csubbasement\u201d of quantum\nmechanics. There are too many layers of interaction in the brain. The parts don\u2019t explain the\nwhole. Calvin calls the leap from the subbasement of quantum mechanics directly to the\npenthouse of consciousness the janitor\u2019s dream. 2\nWhy should investors care about the janitor\u2019s dream? If the stock market is a system that\nemerges from the interaction of many different investors then reductionism\u2014understanding\nindividuals\u2014does not give a good picture of how the market works.

An\ninappropriate perspective of the market can lead to poor judgments and value-destroying decisions.\nSorting Systems\nWhen a system has low complexity and we can define interactions linearly, reductionism is very useful.\nMany engineered systems fit this bill. A skilled artisan can take apart your wristwatch, study the components,\nand have a complete understanding of how the system works. Such systems also lend themselves to\ncentralized decision making. Many companies in the industrial revolution were good examples of engineered\nsystems\u2014a product went down a manufacturing line and each worker contributed to the end product.\nThrough scientific refinement, managers could continually improve the system\u2019s performance.\nOn the other hand, centralized control fails for systems with sufficient complexity. Scientists call these\ncomplex adaptive systems, and refer to the components of the system as agents. Complex adaptive\nsystems exhibit a number of essential properties and mechanisms: 3\n\u2022 \nAggregation. Aggregation is the emergence of complex, large-scale behavior from the collective\ninteractions of many less-complex agents.\n\u2022 \nAdaptive decision rules. Agents within a complex adaptive system take information from the\nenvironment, combine it with their own interaction with the environment, and derive decision rules. In\nturn, various decision rules compete with one another based on their fitness, with the most effective\nrules surviving.\n\u2022 \nNonlinearity. In a linear model, the whole equals the sum of the parts. In nonlinear systems, the\naggregate behavior is more complicated than would be predicted by totaling the parts.\n\u2022 \nFeedback loops. A feedback system is one in which the output of one iteration becomes the input of\nthe next iteration. Feedback loops can amplify or dampen an effect. 4\nComplex adaptive systems include governments, many corporations, and capital markets. Efforts to assert\ntop-down control of these systems generally leads to failure, as we saw with the former Soviet Union. Figure\n1 contrasts the two types of systems.\nThinking about the market as a complex adaptive system is in stark contrast to classical economic and\nfinance theory that depicts the world in Newtonian terms. Economists treat agents as if they are\nhomogenous and build linear models\u2014supply and demand, risk and reward, price and quantity. None of\nthis, of course, much resembles the real world. 4\nFigure 1: Complexity and Decision-Making\nIllustration by Sente Corporation. See www.senteco.com.The Stock Market as a Complex Adaptive\n"

      "text": "Page 3\nSystem\nThe stock market has all of the characteristics of a complex adaptive system. Investors with different\ninvestments styles and time horizons (adaptive decision rules) trade with one another (aggregation), and we\nsee fat-tail price distributions (non-linearity) and imitation (feedback loops). An agent-based approach to\nunderstanding markets is gaining broader acceptance. But this better descriptive framework does not offer the\nneat solutions that the current economic models do.5\nInvestors who view the stock market as a complex adaptive system avoid two cognitive traps. The first is the\nconstant search for a cause for all effects. Critical points, where large-scale reactions are the result of small-\nscale perturbations, are a characteristic of complex adaptive systems. So cause and effect are not always\neasy to link. Following the stock market crash of 1987, for instance, the government commissioned a study to\nisolate the \u201ccause\u201d of the crash. After an exhaustive study, the Brady commission was unable to earth a\nparticular cause. The point here is not that cause and effect don\u2019t exist, but rather that not every effect has a\nproportionate cause. As humans like to identify a cause for every effect, this concept is difficult to internalize.\nThe second trap is to dwell on the input of any individual at the expense of understanding the market itself. For\nexample, executives often question how it is that the empirical evidence shows the market follows cash flows\nwhen most investors talk about accounting results. The answer is that every individual operates with his or her\nown decision rules, while the market represents the aggregation of these rules. Further, studies of systems\nwith sufficient complexity, show that a collective of diverse individuals tends to solve problems better than\nindividuals can\u2014even individuals that are so-called \u201cexperts.\u201d 6\nUsing What You\u2019ve Got\nTime-pressured decision-makers often rely on rules-of-thumb, or heuristics, for their decision-making. While\nheuristics don\u2019t always lead to the best answer in a particular situation, they are often useful precisely because\nthey save time for their users. However, heuristics can also lead investors to make biased decisions. One\nfacet of successful decision-making is gaining an understanding of these biases so as to mitigate their cost. 7\nThe availability heuristic allows investors to assess the frequency or likely cause of an event by the degree to\nwhich similar events are \u201cavailable\u201d in memory. Ease of recall is one bias that emanates from the availability\nheuristic. In other words, investors or managers may place greater emphasis on information that is available\nthan on information that is relevant.\nWe believe this bias is at the heart of the janitor\u2019s dream problem. Investors and managers spend a lot of time\nfocusing on information that is available, like current earnings and multiples, rather than on information that is\nmore meaningful\u2014i.e., what the market reveals about expectations for future performance. Corporate\nmanagers see analyst reports that dwell on earnings, and hence incorrectly assume that the market is a\nsimple addition of these agents.\nInvestors and corporate managers trying to understand the market must recognize that it\u2019s a complex adaptive\nsystem. The market\u2019s action reflects the interaction of many agents, each with varying knowledge, resources,\nand motivation. So a disproportionate focus on individual opinions can be hazardous to wealth creation.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager or co-manager of a public offering of securities for\nor makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies mentioned.\n_____________________________\n1 Sandra Blakeslee, \u201cScientist at Work: John Henry Holland; Searching for Simple Rules of Complexity,\u201d The New York\nTimes, December 26, 1995.\n2 William H.
