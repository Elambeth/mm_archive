The way to manage and evaluate \na new company that is expanding rapidly is very different than it \nis for an old company that serves a mature and saturated market.  \nExhibit 1 is a classic picture of the company life cycle. Early on, \nthe spread between return on invested capital (ROIC) and the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) is negative as the \ncompany invests to create a good or service that the market will \ndemand.2 The business then grows and the spread between \nROIC and WACC turns positive and ultimately peaks. In the end, \nmarket saturation and competition lead to a decline in the spread \nuntil the firm\u2019s returns are equal to, or less than, the cost of capital. \nThe magnitude and sustainability of the spread between ROIC \nand WACC are the defining features of competitive advantage. \nProperly placing a company within a life cycle is challenging \nbecause most firms offer multiple goods or services that are often \nat different points in their individual product life cycles. Further, \ncompanies transition from one stage to another. \nExhibit 1: The Classic Company Life Cycle \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Age is a common proxy. This makes sense as it anthropomorphizes companies. We will see that the \naverage age of companies in the middle and later stages is higher than that in the early stages. But age has \nlimitations, including the fact that some industries move through the life cycle faster than others, some firms are \nquicker learners than their peers, and we can measure age in different ways, such as by listing or founding date.3 \nOther proxies include size and profitability. The notion of size is that small companies are early, and large \ncompanies late, in the life cycle. We find that size does not add much to the analysis. The correlation between \nage and size, while positive, is low. Profitability, measured by ROIC, helps place companies in stages when it is \ncombined with investment opportunity.4 \nWe examined the spread between ROIC and WACC for companies that did an initial public offering (IPO) from \n1990 to 2022. We expected to see a pattern similar to that in exhibit 1: low or negative spreads between ROIC \nand WACC for companies newly listed, rising spreads as they mature, and a decline in senescence. But what \nwe found was nearly the opposite. The spread at the date of the IPO was high and narrowed before stabilizing \naround year five (see exhibit 2).5 \nThis report analyzes the corporate life cycle and its implications for investors. We start by building on a \nframework for establishing stages within the life cycle and describe how to use the statement of cash flows to \nplace companies in the appropriate stage. We then show the aggregate results, by stage, following the process \nof sorting. These include the average ROIC, age, and growth of the companies in each stage. Next, we show \nthe rate at which companies transition from one stage to another, noting that they can move back and forth in \nthe cycle. We also show the historical total shareholder returns (TSRs) that investors have earned from the \nstocks of companies that have either transitioned between stages or stayed in the same stage. Finally, we create \na list of relevant considerations for the stages within the life cycle. \nExhibit 2: Median ROIC \u2013 WACC Spread for Companies from IPO to Year 15, 1990 to 2022 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: ROIC adjusted for intangible investment; Russell 3000 excluding the financial and real estate sectors. \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nMedian Adjusted ROIC-WACC (Percent)\nYears after IPO\n"

All rights reserved. \n5953219 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n3\n \n \nDefining Stages in the Life Cycle       \nThere are a lot of frameworks of the corporate life cycle.6 Most are descriptive and not based on empirical \nanalysis. But all of them sketch a similar picture. Early on, companies have profitability that is below their ultimate \npotential and they have abundant investment opportunities. It is common for them to invest more than they earn. \nIn the middle stages, companies reach their peak profitability and investment prospects are more limited. \nEarnings are greater than investments. Finally, in the later stages, companies see their profitability and \ninvestment options wane. \nThe economists Michael Gort and Steven Klepper developed a life cycle framework based on five stages. \nVictoria Dickinson, a professor of accounting at the University of Mississippi, named the stages introduction, \ngrowth, maturity, shake-out, and decline.7 (We change her \u201cmature\u201d stage to \u201cmaturity\u201d for clarity.) Dickinson \nadded rigor to the classification by linking the stages to results within the statement of cash flows.8 Her approach \nprovides a way to place companies in the appropriate stage, which allows us to determine when companies \ntransition between stages.9 These insights, complemented by data on shareholder returns, can help guide \nexecutives and investors. \nThe statement of cash flows has three parts: cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from investing \nactivities, and cash flow from financing activities. The net of these categories explains the change in a company\u2019s \ncash and cash equivalents from a prior period to the end of the reporting period. The Financial Accounting \nStandards Board in the U.S. mandated that companies include the statement in its current form in 1988, making \nit a relatively new financial statement. Finance textbooks tend to focus more on the income statement and \nbalance sheet than on the statement of cash flows.10 \nDickinson\u2019s insight is that the combination of results from each part of the statement of cash flows indicates \nwhere a company is within its life cycle. Cash flow from operating activities reveals the cash in and out from \ncustomer activity and therefore indicates profitability. Cash flow from investing activities shows the magnitude \nof the company\u2019s investment in pursuit of growth that ostensibly creates value. Cash flow from financing activities \nreconciles the difference between the cash flows associated with operations and investments.  \nEach part of the statement can either be an inflow (cash coming into the firm) or an outflow (cash going out of \nthe firm). There are two outcomes and three sections, which means that there are eight possible combinations \n(23). The framework folds the eight possibilities into the five stages. Here is a brief discussion of the stages and \nhow the inflows or outflows on the statement of cash flows help identify them: \n\u2022 Introduction. Companies in this stage launch a good or service they hope will be commercially viable. \nFor promising industries, lots of competitors tend to enter at the same time. How long a company stays in \nthis stage is often related to the rate of diffusion for the technology. Cash flow from operations is an \noutflow, as the company must absorb pre-production costs and is below efficient economies of scale. \nCash flow from investing is also an outflow because there are substantial investment prospects. Cash flow \nfrom financing is an inflow as the company must raise capital to fund its expansion. \n\u2022 Growth. In this stage the marketplace has accepted the good or service but the threat of new entrants \nremains. Cash flow from operations is an inflow, as the company reaches profitability. Cash flow from \ninvesting remains an outflow because the company continues to invest to sustain growth and deter entry. \nCash flow from financing is also an inflow, albeit to a lesser degree than in the introduction stage, as the \ncompany still needs capital to support growth. \n"

Here the company reaches scale and entrance and exit in the industry are in rough balance. \nCash flow from operations is an inflow as the company maximizes profits. Cash flow from investing is an \noutflow, although near maintenance levels. Cash flow from financing flips to an outflow, as the company \nhas the resources to retire debt or pay shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. \n\u2022 Shake-out. In this stage, the industry starts to contract and firms exit. It reflects three of the eight possible \ncombinations for cash flows and is a catchall for companies that do not fall clearly in another stage. Cash \nflow from operations may be an inflow or outflow and is an inflow in two of the three combinations. Cash \nflow from investing can also be an inflow or an outflow, with the same ratio. Cash flow from financing is \nalso split between an inflow and outflow, with two of the three combinations being outflows. \n\u2022 Decline. In this stage the company, reflecting the markets it serves, is in decline reflecting either market \nsaturation or product obsolescence. Cash flow from operations is an outflow as profitability is elusive. \nCash flow from investing is an inflow as the company disinvests. Cash flow from financing can be either \nan inflow or outflow depending on profitability and proceeds from asset liquidation. \nExhibit 3 summarizes the link between the life cycle stages and the statement of cash flows. The combinations \nthat Dickinson selects to define each stage are based on economic and finance theory, with the exception of the \nshake-out stage. The link between theory and financial statement results allows us to move beyond qualitative \nassessments and into data analysis. The introduction stage was about 6 percent of our sample, growth 38 \npercent, maturity 43 percent, shake-out 7 percent, and decline 6 percent.  \nExhibit 3: Summary of Link Between Life Cycle Stage and Statement of Cash Flows \n \n \nLife Cycle Stage \nCash Flow Type \nIntroduction \nGrowth \nMaturity \nShake-Out \nDecline \nOperating \nOutflow (-) \nInflow (+) \nInflow (+) \nInflow/inflow/outflow (+/-) \nOutflow (-) \nPremise \nAbsorbing  \ncosts \nImproving \nprofitability \nImproved  \nefficiency \nDeclining growth and \nprices \nDeclining growth \nand prices \nInvesting \nOutflow (-) \nOutflow (-) \nOutflow (-) \nInflow/inflow/outflow (+/-) \nInflow (+) \nPremise \nSubstantial \ninvestment \nInvest to \ndeter entry \nMaintenance \nspending \n  \nLiquidate  \nassets \nFinancing  \nInflow (+) \nInflow (+) \nOutflow (-) \nInflow/outflow/outflow (+/-) \nInflow/outflow (+/-) \nPremise \nRaise capital \nfor growth \nRaise capital \nfor growth \nReturn of \ncapital \n  \nDebt repayment or \nrenegotiation \n \nSource: Victoria Dickinson, \u201cCash Flow Patterns as a Proxy for Firm Life Cycle,\u201d Accounting Review, Vol. 86, No. 6, \nNovember 2011, 1969-1994 and Counterpoint Global. \nWe have argued that the statement of cash flows has become increasingly misleading in recent years.11 As a \nresult, we make three adjustments to the statement to better reflect the economics of businesses. We believe \nthat these changes, which we apply to our full sample, align with life cycle theory. \nThe first adjustment moves stock-based compensation (SBC) from cash flow from operations to cash flow from \nfinancing. The rationale is that SBC is in effect one figure that captures both financing and compensation.12 A \nfirm issues shares (financing) and uses the proceeds to remunerate employees (compensation). For this reason, \nit makes sense to remove the benefit of adding back SBC to cash flow from operations. This adjustment has the \nlargest impact on relatively small companies in the technology and health care sectors.13 \n"

All rights reserved. \n5953219 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n5\n \n \nThe second adjustment moves intangible investment from cash flow from operations to cash flow from investing. \nAn investment is an outlay today that is expected to generate future cash flows. Tangible assets, including new \nstores or distribution centers, are physical and accountants record them on the balance sheet as assets and on \nthe statement of cash flows as cash flow from investing.  \nIntangible assets, such as advertising and software, are not physical, and companies expense them on the \nincome statement. Cash flow from operations and investing are both understated as a result. \nThis is important because intangible investments now exceed tangible investments for public companies in the \nU.S. For example, we estimate that intangible SG&A investment was $1.9 trillion, and capital expenditures $1.1 \ntrillion, for companies in the Russell 3000 in 2022, excluding companies in the financial and real estate sectors. \nThe Russell 3000 is an index that tracks the largest stocks in the U.S. by market capitalization.  \nMaking this adjustment requires judgment about how much of the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) \nexpense is necessary to support current operations and how much is an intangible investment that is \ndiscretionary. Further, the adjustment requires an estimate of the useful lives of these assets. This allows us to \nestimate amortization. Estimating the magnitude of intangible investment and appropriate asset lives is an active \narea of research in finance and accounting.14  \nThe final adjustment is to remove the purchases and sales of marketable securities from cash flow from \ninvesting. We do this because we want to focus on investments in the business rather than changes in the \nholdings of liquid securities. \nExhibit 4 illustrates the point by showing all three adjustments for Amazon for their annual results in 2022. Cash \nflow from operations goes from a reported total of $46.8 billion to an adjusted total of $105.6 billion, more than \ndoubling. The sharp increase is the result of substantial intangible investment, net of amortization, and is despite \nthe $19.6 billion reduction as the result of eliminating the benefit of adding back SBC. Cash flow from investing \ngoes from a reported outflow of $37.6 billion to an adjusted outflow of $145.0 billion, underscoring the company\u2019s \nmassive investment. Finally, cash flow from financing goes from a reported inflow of $9.7 to an adjusted inflow \nof $29.3 billion, with the greatest part of the increase coming from the restatement of SBC. Based on these \nadjusted figures, Amazon is in the growth stage of the life cycle. \nNote these adjustments affect neither Amazon\u2019s free cash flow nor the ability of the statement of cash flows to \nreconcile the balance of cash and marketable securities from one year to the next. But they do reclassify items \nto gain better insight into Amazon\u2019s stage in the life cycle. \nExhibit 4: Summary of Adjustments to Amazon\u2019s Statement of Cash Flows, 2022 \n  \n                                  Cash Flow Type \n \n \n  Operating     \n  Activities \nInvesting \nActivities \n       Financing \n       Activities \nReported total \n $46.8 billion \n       -$37.6 billion \n       $9.7 billion \nStock-based compensation \n  -19.6 \n \n       19.6 \nIntangible investments, net \n   78.4  \n         -78.4 \n  \nMarketable securities \n \n         -29.0 \n \nAdjusted total \n$105.6 billion \n     -$145.0 billion \n    $29.3 billion \nSource: Amazon and Counterpoint Global estimates and adjustments. \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5953219 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n6\n \n \nResults for Life Cycle Stages \nWe categorize companies in stages by using Dickinson\u2019s method and including our adjustments. The analysis \nincludes the companies of the stocks in the Russell 3000, excluding those in the financial and real estate sectors, \nfrom 1990 to 2022. The sample includes more than 65,000 observations. We then calculate other measures, \nincluding the ROIC, age since IPO, and the sales growth rate of the companies in each stage. \nWe start with ROIC, defined as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by invested capital. NOPAT, a \ncompany\u2019s cash earnings assuming no financial leverage, is derived primarily from the income statement. \nInvested capital, equivalently the net assets necessary to generate NOPAT and how the company finances \nthose assets, is calculated using the balance sheet.  \nThe adjustment for intangible investment increases NOPAT and invested capital. The adjustment to NOPAT has \nless impact than that for invested capital for certain companies with high traditional ROICs. That means that the \nROIC adjusted for intangibles is lower than the traditional one. For some firms with low traditional ROICs, the \nadjustment to NOPAT is more significant than that for invested capital, which makes the adjusted ROIC higher. \nAverage ROICs are similar for the traditional and adjusted calculations, but the extremes regress toward the \naverage when we consider intangible investments.15  \nExhibit 5 shows the median, average, and aggregate adjusted ROICs by stage in the life cycle. Note the pattern \nis consistent with the traditional life cycle (exhibit 1). ROICs are negative in the introduction stage as companies \nseek to establish their good or service and absorb preproduction costs. ROICs then climb in the growth and \nmaturity stages and again drift lower in the shake-out and decline stages. The average annual adjusted ROIC \nwas 9.2 percent for companies in the Russell 3000 from 1990 to 2022, excluding financials and real estate. \nExhibit 5: Adjusted ROICs for Companies in Each Life Cycle Stage \n \nStage \n   Median \n    Average \n  Aggregate \nIntroduction \n  -7.6% \n-10.1% \n-3.2% \nGrowth \n11.2 \n14.6 \n9.4 \nMaturity \n10.3 \n12.7 \n11.5 \nShake-Out \n3.0 \n3.5 \n4.7 \nDecline \n-13.8 \n-18.9 \n-9.4 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Median and average ROICs based on ROICs winsorized at 1st and 99th percentiles. \nExhibit 6 presents the median and average age, calculated as the age since IPO, for companies in each stage. \nThere is a steady increase in age from introduction through maturity, followed by a decrease in the decline stage. \nTwo points are worth emphasizing.

All rights reserved. \n5953219 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n10\n \n \nHow the Life Cycle Provides a Framework to Understand Businesses \nThe life cycle framework puts companies in categories that can help executives and investors assess and value \nthem. For example, life cycle theory is relevant for capital allocation, the cost of financing, corporate governance, \nand valuation. We briefly discuss each of these topics. \n\u2022 Capital allocation. Introduction, growth, and maturity are the first three stages of the life cycle, and all \nhave outflows from investments. Companies can find, fund, and execute only a finite amount of investment \nopportunities that promise to create value. Some companies run the risk of making investments that \ndestroy value in the pursuit of sales or profit growth.  \nThe retail industry offers a good illustration. Academics studied retailers that had reached the maturity \nstage. It made sense for these companies to slow growth in capital expenditures because the ROIC on \nincremental investments was subpar. They found that those retailers that curtailed growth generated \nsubstantially higher TSRs than those that proceeded with a growth strategy.21    \nThe retail case is clear because new stores are visible and measurable investments, but similar thinking \napplies to all investments. As noted, intangible investments now exceed tangible ones for public \ncompanies in the U.S., so executives and investors have to assess the return on those incremental \ninvestments with the same care.22   \nThe general story is that companies invest substantially in the early stages of the life cycle and return \ncapital to debt and equity holders in the latter ones. Free cash flow, which equals NOPAT minus \ninvestment in future growth, is a measure of a company\u2019s ability to disburse capital to claimholders.  \nCompanies commonly invest more than they earn when they are young and hence have negative free \ncash flow. They must finance the gap through the issuance of equity or debt. Companies generally earn \nmore than they invest when they are mature and therefore generate positive free cash flow. This allows \nthem to return capital. The pattern of cash holdings, as well as equity and debt issuance, are consistent \nwith this sketch.23 \n\u2022 Financing costs. The combination of underlying business risk and the mix of debt and equity financing \ndetermines a company\u2019s financing costs. Business risk is the perceived volatility of operating profits. \nInvestors use unlevered beta, also known as asset beta, to measure business risk. Unlevered beta is a \ncompany\u2019s market risk excluding the effect of debt. The debt-to-total capital ratio, debt divided by the sum \nof debt and the market value of equity, captures the mix of debt and equity financing. Interest expense \nfrom debt financing is essentially a fixed cost. As a result, adding debt increases risk.24 \nExhibit 13 presents the association between unlevered beta and the debt-to-total capital ratio for nearly \n100 industries using data provided by Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance. In general, industries \nwith high business risk have lower debt-to-total capital ratios than industries with low business risk do.  \n \n \n \n \n \n"

This is precisely what the research shows. Using Dickinson\u2019s life cycle \ncategorization, the cost of equity and the cost of debt both follow a \u201cU\u201d shape: high in the introduction \nstage, low in the growth and maturity stages, and high again in the shake-out and decline stages.26  \nExhibit 14 shows these results based on academic studies.

Exhibit 15 shows \nthe debt-to-total capital ratio for companies by stage in the life cycle. The broad pattern that emerges is \nthat the maturity stage tends to be the one with the lowest leverage, and leverage is higher in earlier and \nlater stages. \nExhibit 15: Aggregate, Median, and Average Debt-to-Total Capital by Stage in the Life Cycle \nDebt/Total Capital \nAggregate \n   Median \nAverage \nIntroduction \n32.3% \n8.6% \n19.5% \nGrowth \n      22.1 \n    12.9 \n      19.4 \nMaturity \n      16.4 \n    14.0 \n19.3 \nShake-Out \n      27.3 \n    20.3 \n25.4 \nDecline \n      28.9 \n    11.9 \n21.5 \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \n\u2022 Corporate governance. One straightforward observation is that a company\u2019s incentives and the skills of \nits leaders should align with an assessment of the business\u2019s stage in the life cycle. As noted, companies \nhave dynamic capabilities, which means that they can revert to an earlier stage with the appropriate \ninvestment. However, empirical research shows that there is a lot of inertia in the investment decisions \nthat companies make and that most companies would be better off with more dynamic capital allocation.27   \nDifferent skills are useful in the various stages of the life cycle. Aswath Damodaran attaches evocative \nnames to the chief executive officers (CEOs) he deems to have the right skills by stage, including \u201cSteve, \nthe Visionary,\u201d \u201cBob, the Builder,\u201d \u201cDonna, the Defender,\u201d and \u201cLarry, the Liquidator.\u201d28 Further, CEOs tend \nto seek less risk the longer they have been in the job.  \nIncentives matter, too. Companies appropriately focus on growth early on to meet market demand and \nachieve necessary economies of scale. But as the industry and business matures, executives need to \nshift their emphasis from growth to a balance between growth and ROIC. As we saw with the example of \nthe retailers, a singular focus on growth can lead to investments in projects that destroy shareholder value. \nFinally, there are appropriate strategies for declining businesses.29 Few executives want to manage \nshrinking operations, but the ability to return cash from these operations to investors who can use the \nfunds to invest in more promising parts of the economy is a vital component of the market system.  \n\u2022 Valuation. The value of a company is the present value of the cash flows it will generate in the future. \nHowever, the visibility, predictability, and growth of cash flows vary by stage. This creates different \nvaluation challenges for each one. For example, companies in the introduction stage may not be profitable \nbut have substantial potential for growth and value creation. Companies in the decline stage generate \nmost of their cash from disinvestment, essentially extracting the remaining capital from the business.  \nThe concept of duration is also relevant for valuation across all the stages. Duration measures the \nweighted average time investors expect to wait before they receive cash flows. For instance, the duration \nand maturity are the same for a zero-coupon bond because you get all your money back at the end. Credit \ninvestors use duration more often than equity investors do. \nAcademic research suggests that having substantial investment opportunities, which describes \ncompanies in the introduction stage, is linked to long duration. Firms with limited or no investment \n"

All rights reserved. \n5953219 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n13\n \n \nprospects, such as those in the shake-out or decline stages, have short durations.30 Duration also \nindicates the sensitivity of an asset price to changes in the opportunity cost of capital. The stocks of \ncompanies with long durations react more to changes in interest rates than those of companies with short \ndurations.  \nA few concepts are useful in valuing companies in the introduction stage. The first is to focus intently on \nthe basic unit of analysis, or how a company makes money. For brick-and-mortar retailers, for instance, it \nwould be the return on investment from building a new store. For a subscription business, it is lifetime \ncustomer value, defined as the cash flows a customer will generate over his or her lifetime minus the cost \nto acquire the customer.31 When the basic unit of analysis indicates a company\u2019s investments create value, \nshort-term losses and negative free cash flow are not only acceptable but generally desirable. \nBecause companies in the introduction stage need to raise capital to sustain their operations, having a \nCEO who tells a good story to stakeholders, including employees, customers, and capital providers, is \noften crucial.32 This skill becomes less important as the business establishes itself in the market.  \nFinally, companies in the introduction stage may have real options, the right but not the obligation to make \ninvestments in the business. The value of these options is difficult to capture using a discounted cash flow \nmodel based on current operations.33 Real options analysis may be useful for companies that compete in \nbusinesses with high uncertainty, have management teams skilled at cultivating and exercising options, \nand are market leaders.  \nA classic approach to valuing a business is to add the steady-state value to the future opportunities for \nvalue creation.34 The steady-state value assumes that today\u2019s earnings will continue indefinitely, and it \ncan be readily translated into a multiple by dividing 1 by the cost of equity.  \nFor example, the baseline price-earnings ratio today, assuming current earnings persist and that there are \nno opportunities to create value, is 11.1 times, or 1 divided by a current estimate of the cost of equity of 9 \npercent (1/.09).35 Historically, we estimate that about two-thirds of the stock market\u2019s value is from the \nsteady state and one-third from the prospect of future value creation. \nYou can think of valuation in the growth and maturity stages with this breakdown in mind. The value of \ngrowth businesses will rely more on future value creation, and the value of mature businesses will depend \nmore on the steady state. In all cases, understanding the magnitude and return on incremental investment \nis crucial.  \nMultiples for businesses in decline can be valued with a variation of the Gordon Growth Model, D/(k-g), \nwhere D is distributable cash, k is the weighted average cost of capital, and g is the growth in perpetuity.36 \nIn the case of businesses in decline, growth is a negative number. That means that distributable cash is \ndivided by a higher number (subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart). \nThis lowers the value. For example, the appropriate multiple is 6.7 times assuming that growth is -6 \npercent (1/[.09 + .06] = 6.7).   \nThe core concepts of valuation apply across all stages of the life cycle. But the points of emphasis shift, \nin terms of both cash flow patterns and the cost of capital, as companies move through the life cycle.  \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5953219 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n14\n \n \nConclusion \nInvestors commonly apply various frameworks to assess the characteristics and prospects of the businesses \nthey are analyzing. One such framework is the corporate life cycle, the stages of a company\u2019s existence, which \ncan provide insight into capital allocation, financing costs, governance, and valuation.  \nThere are many models of the corporate life cycle, but few are grounded in theory. A simple approach based \nsolely on age yields a pattern inconsistent with the concept. Victoria Dickinson, a professor of accounting, \ncreated a way to place companies in one of five stages of the life cycle based on results from the statement of \ncash flows. The stages are introduction, growth, maturity, shake-out, and decline. Dickinson melds theory and \ndata.  \nWe use Dickinson\u2019s framework with three adjustments to the statement of cash flows. We move stock-based \ncompensation from cash flow from operations to cash flow from financing, which decreases cash flow from \noperations and increases cash flow from financing. We also reflect intangible SG&A investments, which \nincreases cash flow from operations and the outflow of cash flow from investing. And we remove the purchases \nand sales of marketable securities from cash flow from investing. These adjustments have no impact on free \ncash flow or the function of the cash flow statement to reconcile cash balances from one period to the next. \nWe apply this analysis to companies in the Russell 3000, excluding financials and real estate, from 1990 to \n2022. We then examine the output of our categorization, including the ROIC, age, and sales growth by stage. \nAbout 80 percent of companies in our sample are in the growth or maturity stages. The patterns that emerge \nare consistent with the concept of the corporate life cycle and appear more informative than classification \napproaches that are qualitative. \nFirms do not pass through the stages linearly but rather transition between the stages. This reflects dynamic \ncapabilities and competition. We analyze this pattern of transition and examine the TSRs that result from the \nvarious combinations of starting and ending stages over three years. The highest TSRs, on average, are for \nthose companies that end up in the growth stage. \nWe finish by offering some thoughts on how the life cycle framework can assist executives and investors to \nassess and value companies. We focus on capital allocation, the cost of financing, corporate governance, and \nvaluation. In each case, the needs and emphasis for a company shift, which means that the mindset and skills \nof managers must align with a company\u2019s priorities.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
