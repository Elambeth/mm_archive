      "text": "June 14, 2016  \n \nOperating Leverage \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nFor a fundamental investor, anticipating revisions in expectations is the key to generating attractive returns.2 \nSources of those revisions include fundamental outcomes (typically earnings revisions) and an assessment of \nhow the market will value those fundamentals (multiple expansion or contraction). Investors who are able to \nforecast earnings in a year\u2019s time that are substantially different than today\u2019s expectations can earn \nmeaningful excess returns.3  \n \nAnalysts are commonly too optimistic about earnings growth and often miss estimates by a wide margin.4 This \nis especially pronounced for companies that have high operating leverage and surprise the market with weak \nsales.5 Buy-side analysts are generally more optimistic and less accurate than sell-side analysts.6   \n \nOperating leverage measures the change in operating profit as a function of the change in sales. Operating \nleverage is high when a company realizes a relatively large change in operating profit for every dollar of change \nin sales. Operating leverage is low when operating profit is mostly unchanged for every dollar of change in \nsales. Operating profit is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and is the same as operating income.  \n \nThis report outlines a systematic way to assess earnings revisions with a specific emphasis on operating \nleverage. The goal is to be able to better anticipate revisions in expectations. The issue of operating leverage \ndoes not receive enough attention, in our view, and it can provide insight into excess returns. For instance, \nthere is empirical evidence that operating leverage can help explain the value premium.7 \n \nExhibit 1 is the roadmap for this analysis. The process starts on the left side with an analysis of the change in \nsales. Sales changes, in turn, can be refined using \u201cvalue factors\u201d to determine the impact on operating profit. \nThe value factors are based on established microeconomic principles. Consideration of sales changes and the \nrole of the value factors allows you to calculate operating leverage, or \u201coperating margin beta (\u03b2).\u201d You can \nthen incorporate the degree of financial leverage to determine the variability of earnings.  \n \nThe main utility of exhibit 1 is to allow you to understand the cause and effect of changes in earnings. The \ninteraction between sales and operating profit is crucial. Not all sales growth has the same effect on \nprofitability. Note that you can use the roadmap to analyze the past as well as to anticipate the future.     \n \nExhibit 1: Framework for Assessing Operating Leverage \n \nSource: Alfred Rappaport and Michael J.

      "text": "June 14, 2016  \n \nOperating Leverage \n3 \nThe easiest way to think about operating leverage is as the ratio of fixed to variable costs. Fixed costs are \ncosts that a company must bear irrespective of its sales level. If sales shrink, fixed costs don\u2019t budge and \nprofits fall sharply. Conversely, profits rise substantially if sales grow. Theme parks are an example of a \nbusiness with high operating leverage. Roughly three-quarters of the costs for that business are fixed, with \nlabor as the largest component.8  \n \nVariable costs are linked to output. These costs rise and fall in tandem with sales. The commissions a \ncompany pays to its sales force is an example of a variable cost. Commissions move together with sales, \nlimiting the degree of operating leverage.    \n \nExhibit 2 illustrates the impact that sales changes have on operating profit margins for businesses with high \n(75 percent) or low (25 percent) fixed costs. The operating profit margin is 20 percent for both businesses \nwhen sales are $10 million. At $25 million of sales, the high-fixed-cost business sees its operating profit \nmargin soar to nearly 60 percent, while the low-fixed-cost business has an operating profit margin of only \nslightly above 30 percent. At $5 million of sales, however, the business with high fixed costs loses money and \nrecords a margin of -40 percent, while the business with low variable costs breaks even.    \n \nExhibit 2: Cost Structure Composition and Operating Profit Scalability \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.  \nNote: Cost structure based on $10 million in sales. \n \nExhibit 3 shows the ratio of fixed assets to total assets by sector. A fixed asset is not sold or consumed during \nthe normal course of business. Examples include land, manufacturing plants, and acquired intangibles. The \nbasic idea is that companies that rely on a high ratio of fixed to total assets have high fixed costs. There is a \npositive correlation between the ratio of fixed assets to total assets and operating leverage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nOperating Profit  Margin (Percent)\nSales ($ Millions)\n75% Fixed / 25% Variable\n25% Fixed / 75% Variable\n"

While the distinction between fixed and \nvariable costs is practical and useful for modeling purposes, companies can reduce fixed and variable costs if \nsales decline.9 Further, growth eventually dilutes the advantage of an incumbent in a business with high fixed \ncosts, because the ratio of fixed to variable costs declines as the industry grows.10  \n \nExhibit 4 shows the drivers of operating profit changes for the largest 1,000 global companies, by market \ncapitalization, for the last 65 years.

Next we review the empirical results \nof our analysis of operating margin \u03b2, or how the change in operating profit relates to the change in sales. We \nconclude with data on financial leverage. Companies with debt incur interest expense, which serves to amplify \nthe changes in operating earnings. Companies with high operating and financial leverage have greater swings \nin earnings, and hence risk, than those with low operating and financial leverage.11   \n \nSales Growth \n \nWe can forecast sales growth using a number of approaches.

      "text": "June 14, 2016  \n \nOperating Leverage \n7 \nIndustry growth is the primary factor that analysts consider when they make sales forecasts.12 There are a \nnumber of issues to consider when assessing industry growth.13 The first is where the industry is in its life \ncycle.14 Industry growth tends to follow an S-curve, where there is rapid sales growth for a time followed by \nflattened sales growth. Industries have different rates of growth as well as variations in growth rates.15  \n \nOne common analytical mistake is to extrapolate high growth in the middle of an S-curve. One famous \nexample is the production of color television sets, which were launched in the late 1950s and reached a sales \npeak in 1968. The industry grew rapidly in the 1960s, which encouraged manufacturers to add capacity. But \nthey extrapolated the sharp growth and failed to recognize the top of the S-curve. The result was \nmanufacturing capacity in the later 1960s of 14 million units and peak unit sales of 6 million units. A sensible \njudgment of the number of potential customers multiplied by the revenue per customer informs the \nassessment of industry size.  \n    \nMergers and acquisitions (M&A) are also important in determining sales growth. One study of the sales growth \nof large companies found that M&A accounted for about one-third of total top-line gain.16 Large M&A deals \nmerit careful analysis because they can change the nature of a company\u2019s operating leverage. However, the \nevidence shows it is challenging to create substantial value through M&A.17   \n \nChanges in a company\u2019s market share within an industry also influence sales growth rates. Market shares \ntend to be volatile in emerging industries, as technological change is rapid and entry and exit is rampant.18 But \nmarket shares tend to settle down as an industry matures. There is a positive correlation between market \nshare and profitability. But there is also evidence that corporate objectives focused on competitors, including \nmarket share targets, are mostly harmful to a firm\u2019s profitability.19    \n \nThere are two basic ways to forecast. One is to gather information and create a bottom-up forecast. The other \nis to look at the outcomes of instances in a similar reference class.20 For instance, you might forecast a \nbeverage company\u2019s sales by estimating the price and volume of future servings. Alternatively, you might \nconsider the distribution of the sales growth rates for companies of a similar size. In the latter case, you are \nconsidering the commonality with other businesses rather than focusing on the uniqueness of the situation. \n \nOur report, \u201cThe Base Rate Book\u2014Sales Growth,\u201d provides the base rates of sales growth for thousands of \ncompanies going back to 1950, offering a reality check for forecasts.21 This research shows that analysts and \ncompanies are commonly too optimistic about sales growth rates, that sales declines occur much more \nfrequently than forecasts suggest, and that mean and median sales growth rates decline as firm size increases.  \n \nSales growth is the most important value driver for most companies because it is the largest source of cash \nand affects four of the value factors. But it is important to emphasize that sales growth, profit growth, and \nvalue creation are distinct. Sales growth only creates value when a company earns a rate of return on \ninvestment that is above the cost of capital. As a result, companies can grow profits without creating value. \nIndeed, sales growth destroys value for a company earning a return below the cost of capital. \n \nThe threshold margin is the level of operating profit margin at which a company earns its cost of capital.22 To \nbreak even in terms of economic value, a company with higher capital intensity requires a higher operating \nprofit margin than a company with lower capital intensity. So threshold margin is an analytically sound way to \nmake the connection between sales growth, profits, and value creation. Appendix A defines threshold margin \nand incremental threshold margin. Appendix B shows that the overall rise in operating profit margin has been \ndriven by companies in the highest margin quintile and documents the history of operating profit margin by \nsector. \n \n"

      "text": "June 14, 2016  \n \nOperating Leverage \n8 \nValue Factors \n \nSales changes can have varying effects on operating profit margins. Careful consideration of the value factors, \nincluding volume, price and mix, operating leverage, and economies of scale, will allow you to sort out cause \nand effect. Here\u2019s a quick description of the value factors:23 \n \uf402\n Volume. Volume captures the potential revision in expectations for the number of units a company sells. \nVolume changes lead to sales changes and can influence operating profit margins through operating \nleverage and economies of scale.  \n \uf402\n Price and Mix. Change in selling price means that a company sells the same unit at a different price. If a \ncompany can raise its price in an amount greater than its incremental cost, margins will rise. Warren \nBuffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the most successful \ninvestors in the past half century, argued that \u201cthe single most important decision in evaluating a business \nis pricing power.\u201d This is not just relevant for established businesses. Marc Andreessen, co-founder and \ngeneral partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, recently said \u201cprobably the single \nnumber one thing we try to get our companies to do is raise prices.\u201d24  \n \nPrice elasticity, a measure of the change in the demand for the quantity of a good or service relative to a \nchange in price, is one way to assess pricing power. Goods or services that are inelastic (e.g., cigarettes \nand gasoline) have small changes in demand for a given price change, whereas price changes create \nlarge changes in demand for elastic goods (e.g., leisure airline travel and high-end spirits). One study of \nprice elasticity for a sample of roughly 370 goods found that a 1 percent change in price would lead to \nan average of a 1.76 percent change in demand.25      \n \nPrice mix captures the change in sales of high- and low-margin products. Goodyear Tire & Rubber is an \nexample of a company that has had a positive sales mix in recent years. Goodyear\u2019s sales in 2015 were \n28 percent lower than those in 2011 and its total unit volume was 8 percent less. Both sales and volume \ndeclined in each year since 2011 with the exception of 2015 for volume. Yet the company\u2019s operating \nincome rose nearly 50 percent over that period, while its operating profit margin expanded 6 percentage \npoints. A shift in mix from low-margin commodity tires to high-margin premium tires allowed the company \nto increase operating margins.26 Exhibit 7 summarizes these figures. \n \nExhibit 7: Goodyear Tire & Rubber Change in Sales Mix (2011-2015) \n \nSource: Company reports. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nOperating Profit Margin (Percent)\nSales (Billions U.S. Dollars)\nSales\nOperating Profit Margin\n"

      "text": "June 14, 2016  \n \nOperating Leverage \n9 \uf402\n Operating Leverage. Businesses almost always invest money before they can generate sales and \nprofits. These outlays are called \u201cpreproduction costs.\u201d For some companies, including those in the \nchemical, steel, and utility businesses, the costs relate to physical facilities. These investments are \ncapitalized on the balance sheet and the accountants depreciate their value on the income statement \nover time. Other companies, such as those in the biotechnology or software industries, make huge \ninvestments in research and development or in writing code but expense most of those investments.  \n \nPreproduction costs lower operating profit margins in the short run. But as subsequent sales of the good \nor service occur, margins rise. Think of it this way: Say a manufacturing company incurs substantial \npreproduction costs to build a factory that can produce 100 widgets but only produces 50 today. As \nvolume rises from 50 to 100 widgets, the incremental investment is small and operating margins rise. \nOperating leverage is relevant when you see a company in a position to reap the benefit of its spending \non preproduction costs.  \n \nCapacity utilization is one way to assess operating leverage (see exhibit 8). Operating margins tend to \nshrink when capacity utilization falls and expand when utilization rises. Exhibit 9 shows this relationship.     \n \nExhibit 8: Capacity Utilization: Total Industry (1967-April 2016) \n \nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.). \nNote: Monthly data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n1967\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\n2015\nPercent of Capacity\n"

A company enjoys economies of scale when it can perform key activities at a \nlower cost per unit as its volume increases. These tasks include purchasing, production, marketing, sales, \nand distribution. Economies of scale lead to greater efficiency as volume increases. This is distinct from \noperating leverage, where margin improvement is the result of spreading preproduction costs over larger \nvolumes. Mistaking operating leverage for economies of scale may lead to the incorrect conclusion that \nunit costs will decline even as the company expands to meet new demand. \n \nThe financial results of Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer in the United States, are an \nexample of economies of scale. Home Depot\u2019s gross margins expanded from 27.7 percent in fiscal \n1996 to 29.9 percent in fiscal 2001 as it added incremental sales in excess of $30 billion. The company \nattributed the improvement in its profitability to the ability to use its size to get better prices from its \nsuppliers. \n \uf402\n Cost Efficiencies. Cost efficiencies can also affect operating profit margin but are unrelated to sales \nchanges and hence not relevant to a discussion of operating leverage. Still, you must account for \noperating margin changes as the result of cost efficiencies. These efficiencies come about in two ways. \nA company can either reduce costs within an activity or it can reconfigure its activities.27  \n \nThe discussion of sales changes and the value factors provides you with a framework to consider operating \nleverage, or how operating profit rises or falls as a function of a change in sales.

The error in analyst forecasts tends to be larger in sectors and \nindustries where the operating margin \u03b2 is high. For example, earnings surprises are large in the metal industry \nbut small in the food industry.28 Understanding the full framework for assessing operating leverage is \nparticularly important for sectors and industries with high operating margin \u03b2\u2019s.  \n \nAnalyst errors tend to be large at peaks and troughs in industrial production. When industrial production \ngrowth accelerates, the errors in analyst forecasts tend to fall. When industrial production decelerates, errors \ntend to rise. Analysts, who are normally optimistic, are rewarded when economic conditions are favorable and \nmiss the mark substantially when conditions are poor.29    \n \nNotwithstanding the errors that analysts make when the economy is expanding or contracting, their earnings \nforecasts are more accurate than those of management for businesses with high operating margin \u03b2. \nManagement forecasts are better than those of analysts when a firm is dealing with unusual issues such as \nlosses, inventory increases, and excess capacity. Overall, forecasts by management are more accurate than \nanalysts about half of the time, suggesting that the information advantage executives have may not be as \nsignificant as macroeconomic factors in determining the accuracy of their forecasts.30     \n \nAt this point, we have developed a framework to anticipate changes in operating profit. The process involves \nconsideration of macroeconomic outcomes and microeconomic factors, informed by empirical results. This \nanalysis is the basis for \u201casset beta,\u201d the risk of a company based on the volatility of operating income and \nwithout regard for financial policy. We now introduce the role of financial leverage as a final step to understand \nvolatility in earnings.       \n \nFinancial Leverage \n \nEarnings volatility for a company is determined by the combination of volatility in operating profit and financial \nleverage. Financial leverage captures the amount of debt a company assumes, net of the cash that it holds. \nLots of debt increases the volatility of earnings because a company has to pay interest expense, which you \ncan think of as another fixed cost. As a result, financial leverage amplifies changes in operating income. In \nexhibit 1, we refer to this as \u201cfinancial leverage beta (\u03b2).\u201d  \n \nTo illustrate the impact of financial leverage \u03b2, consider two companies, A and B, which have the same \nscenarios for operating profit next year: \n \n \n \nSince A is free of debt, the variability of pretax profit mirrors that of operating profit. In this case, the highest \nprofit scenario ($120) is 50 percent greater than the lowest ($80). \n \n \nCompany A\nOperating profit\nInterest expense\nPretax profit\nBullish scenario\n$120\n$0\n$120\nBase case scenario\n100\n0\n100\nBearish scenario\n80\n0\n80\nCompany B\nOperating profit\nInterest expense\nPretax profit\nBullish scenario\n$120\n$30\n$90\nBase case scenario\n100\n30\n70\nBearish scenario\n80\n30\n50\n"

The addition of debt creates more \nvolatility in earnings and may suggest different values for the businesses.   \n \nExhibit 13 shows the debt-to-total capital ratios by sector. This ratio uses the book value of debt and the \nmarket value of equity. Higher ratios of debt to total capital are consistent with higher financial leverage. \nHowever, the substantial increase in cash holdings distorts this relationship. For example, Apple\u2019s debt-to-\ntotal-capital ratio was approximately 13 percent on March 31, 2016 (debt of $78 billion and market value of \nequity of $540 billion).

One way to do this is to calculate the threshold margin, or the level of operating profit margin at \nwhich a company earns its cost of capital. To break even in terms of economic value, a company with higher \ncapital intensity requires a higher margin than a company with lower capital intensity.33 \n \nLet\u2019s examine a simple example. Assume a company has the following financial characteristics:  \n \nBase sales \n$100  \nSales growth \n8.0% \nOperating profit margin (base) \n8.4% \nOperating profit margin (incremental) \n8.4% \nIncremental fixed capital rate \n35% \nIncremental working capital rate \n25% \nTax rate \n35% \nCost of capital \n10% \n \nThe definitions for sales growth, operating profit margin, tax rate, and the cost of capital are straightforward. \nThe incremental fixed capital rate captures how much a company will spend on incremental investments in \nfixed capital (more formally, capital expenditures minus depreciation) and is measured as a percentage change \nin sales.  \n \nFor example, if sales grow by $10 and the incremental fixed capital rate is 35 percent, the company\u2019s capital \nexpenditure, net of depreciation, is $3.5. The same idea applies to working capital. For every incremental \ndollar in sales, the incremental working capital rate measures the percent a company needs to reinvest in \nworking capital.  \n \nWe get these figures if we apply the numbers to five years of free cash flow: \n \nYear 0 \nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nYear 3 \nYear 4 \nYear 5 \nSales \n$100.0 \n108.0 \n116.6 \n126.0 \n136.0 \n146.9 \nOperating income \n8.4 \n9.1 \n9.8 \n10.6 \n11.4 \n12.3 \nTaxes \n3.2 \n3.4 \n3.7 \n4.0 \n4.3 \nIncremental fixed capital  \n2.8 \n3.0 \n3.3 \n3.5 \n3.8 \nIncremental fixed capital  \n2.0 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n2.7 \nFree cash flow \n1.1 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.5 \n \nWe can see that the company is growing modestly. But the question is whether it is creating shareholder value. \nWe can only assess that by determining whether the company earns a return on its incremental investments \nthat exceeds the cost of capital.  \n \nThe answer is that this company is value neutral (see the column \u201cshareholder value added\u201d at the far right \nbelow). It earns its cost of capital on its investments. This demonstrates that growth does not equal value \ncreation.  \n \n"

During the same time, the healthcare and technology sectors went from 17 to 34 percent of the \nmarket capitalization. \n \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1950\n1954\n1958\n1962\n1966\n1970\n1974\n1978\n1982\n1986\n1990\n1994\n1998\n2002\n2006\n2010\n2014\nOperating Profit Margin (Percent)\n"

Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default variables and incorporated into the \nalgorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and earnings data provided by outside data vendors are \nsubject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying economics of firm performance. These adjustments provide \nconsistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies across industries or national borders. The default scenario that is \nproduced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline valuation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce \nalternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request.  \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation \nmodel establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default variables may also \nbe adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur.
