      "text": "May 3, 2016  \n \nThoughts on Dividends and Buybacks \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nThe value of a company is determined by the cash that it pays to its owners over its life. A firm can return \ncapital to shareholders through dividends, share buybacks, or by selling the company for cash. Ultimately, \nvalue boils down to cash in the pocket. Empirical evidence supports the theory. \n \nCompanies in a position to pay a dividend or to buy back stock have to weigh those alternatives against \ninvesting the money back into the business. The idea is that an attractive internal investment will allow the \ncompany to return even more money in the future, adjusted for risk and inflation, and will therefore enrich \ncurrent investors. Most investors agree on these points. Appendix A examines the concern that companies \ntoday are underinvesting in their businesses. \n \nThe relative merits of dividends, buybacks, and investment are contentious. Share buybacks, in particular, \nseem to stir emotion, much of it negative.2 The purpose of this report is to address a handful of \nmisconceptions: \n \uf402\n Dividends are the major contributor to capital accumulation over time; \n \uf402\n Buybacks destroy value or waste money; \n \uf402\n Shareholders can be passive with regard to share buyback policy. \n \nPrice Appreciation and Dividends  \n \nInvestment managers and pundits often make the claim that dividends are the primary source of total \nshareholder return over the long haul.3 But it is crucial to distinguish between the equity rate of return for one \nyear, which is simply the change in the stock price plus the dividend, and the capital accumulation rate, or total \nshareholder return (TSR) over time. The central difference is that total shareholder return incorporates the \nreinvestment of dividends. As a result, these are very distinct concepts.4   \n \nFor example, a stock that has price appreciation (g) of 7 percent with a dividend yield (d) of 3 percent in a \ngiven year has an equity rate of return of 10 percent. But if the g and d remain constant over time, the total \nshareholder return is 10.21 percent, based on this formula: \n \n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc60\u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b= \ud835\udc54+ (1 + \ud835\udc54)\ud835\udc51 \n  \nOnce you appreciate this distinction, you can see that \u201cprice appreciation is the sole source of investment \nreturns that increase accumulated capital.\u201d5 This quotation comes from Alfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus \nat the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and it surprises even experienced investors. \nThe conventional wisdom is that the income component makes a crucial contribution to accumulated capital \nand that its contribution grows over time. This is wrong. \n \nTo see why, let\u2019s slow things down and again distinguish between the equity rate of return and total \nshareholder return. We\u2019ll use a $100 stock and the same g of 7 percent and d of 3 percent.  \n  \nIf you consider results for one year, it is pretty simple. You start with an investment of $100 and end the year \nwith a stock worth $107 and $3 in cash. You begin with $100 and end with $110 for a 10 percent return. So \nfar, so good. \n \n"

      "text": "May 3, 2016  \n \nThoughts on Dividends and Buybacks \n3 \nNow let\u2019s go to the total shareholder return case. The TSR calculation makes the crucial assumption that 100 \npercent of dividends are reinvested in the stock. So if at the end of the year you have a $107 stock and a $3 \ndividend, you use the cash dividend to buy more stock, getting your investment in the stock back up to $110. \nOnce you make the decision to reinvest all of your dividends, it becomes clear that capital accumulation \ndepends entirely on the price change over the time you invest. \n \nThe key to understanding TSR is that it is a measure over multiple periods. In year two, the stock rises to \n$117.70 and the dividend is $3.30, yielding a total value of $121. The dividend is again reinvested in the \nstock, meaning that you have $121 in stock at the end of two periods. The process repeats.     \n \nVery few investors actually earn the TSR because it demands that they fully reinvest all dividends. In reality, \nmany investors choose to spend their dividends. This has utility for those investors, of course, but prevents \nthem from earning the TSR.  \n \nFurther, because the government taxes dividends, investors in a taxable account cannot reinvest the full \namount of their dividends. For companies that pay a dividend, only investors who reinvest 100 percent of their \ndividends in a tax-free account actually realize the TSR. This is a very small percentage of the investing \npopulation. Indeed, the value of the stock market rises at a lower rate than the market\u2019s TSR as investors and \ngovernments extract value along the way.6 \n \nSaving is the act of deferring current consumption in order to consume more in the future. Investors save to \nfund retirement, pay for education, or to ensure that an institution such as a university can thrive in the future. \nIn each case, the investor cares about capital accumulation.  \n \nFor equities, price appreciation is the only source of investment return that increases accumulated capital. The \nreason is that an investor makes an investment decision to reinvest the dividend into the stock. Say you own a \nstock that trades at $100 and declares a $3 dividend. The day the dividend is paid, you have a stock worth \n$97 and cash of $3.7 You must put the $3 back into the stock to earn the total shareholder return. \n \nThe Value Conservation Principle \n \nYou commonly hear complaints that companies buy back stock at prices that are too high and thus \u201cdestroy \nshareholder value\u201d or \u201cwaste money.\u201d8 This is a simplistic assessment that confuses two issues. \n \nThe first issue is what happens to the value of a firm when it pays out capital. Say a company is worth $1,000 \nand it chooses to pay out $200 to its shareholders. It should be obvious that the value of the firm following the \ndisbursement is $800. Indeed, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the company pays a dividend, buys back stock, or \ndonates the $200 to a charity. The value of the firm adjusts accordingly.  \n \nThe second issue is the plight of the ongoing versus selling shareholders. If a company buys back stock that is \novervalued, the sellers benefit at the expense of the continuing shareholders. If a company buys back stock \nthat is undervalued, the ongoing shareholders benefit at the expense of the selling shareholders. All \nshareholders are treated the same if a company pays a dividend or buys back stock at fair value.  \n \nThe important point is that there is a value conservation principle: the winners and the losers offset one \nanother.9 It is true that ongoing shareholders suffer if a company buys back stock at $50 per share and it \nsubsequently drops to $30. But you can\u2019t forget that the sellers at $50 made out well.  \n \n"

      "text": "May 3, 2016  \n \nThoughts on Dividends and Buybacks \n4 \nHere is another point to consider if you are a fan of dividends. If you agree that buying back undervalued \nshares adds value for ongoing shareholders and you believe your portfolio contains undervalued stocks, why \nwould you ever want one of your holdings to pay a dividend? As Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive \nofficer of Berkshire Hathaway, has written, \u201cIndeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds \nintelligently: It\u2019s hard to go wrong when you\u2019re buying dollar bills for 80\u00a2 or less.\u201d10 \n   \nDoing Nothing Is Doing Something \n \nImagine you were a shareholder of a company that paid a dividend when the stock was at $50 and then it \nsubsequently dropped to $30. Would you have any complaints about the dividend? Now imagine that you \nwere a shareholder of a company that repurchased shares at $50 (you did not sell) and then the stock \nslumped to $30. How would you feel?  \n \nChances are you would not have any complaints about the dividend. Indeed, the dividend you received might \nsoften the psychological blow of the steep price decline.11 But you would likely be irritated by the inopportune \nbuyback. This is despite the fact that you own the stock because you found it attractive at a higher price. \n \nIf you rewind the situation with the buyback, it is easy to see that you could have sold a prorated number of \nshares that would have resulted in a homemade dividend and the same percentage ownership in the company. \nThis leads to an important point: if you own the shares of a company buying back stock, doing nothing is \ndoing something. That something is increasing your percentage ownership in the company.  \n \nSome of the misgiving about buybacks is well placed, as companies pursue them with multiple motivations. \nThe fair value school takes a steady and consistent approach to buybacks. The intrinsic value school seeks to \nbuy back shares only when management deems them to be undervalued. But perhaps the largest group is the \nimpure motives school, which seeks to boost accounting numbers or offset dilution from compensation \nplans.12 Research shows that there is no correlation between share repurchase intensity, measured as the \ndifference between the growth in net income and earnings per share, and TSR.13 \n \nInvestors must be diligent in assessing management\u2019s motivation for its buyback program and need to \nrecognize the consequences of inactivity when companies do buy back shares.  \n \nConclusion  \n \nThe value of a business is the present value of future cash flow disbursed to the owners. Appendix B \nsummarizes the details of buybacks and dividends for the S&P 500 Index in 2015 and shows the long-term \ntrends in spending. The primary mechanisms to return cash to shareholders are dividends and share buybacks. \nYet there is a great deal of muddled thinking about the role that dividends and buybacks play in building \nwealth.  \n \nIn spite of claims that dividends contribute substantially to long-term TSR, price appreciation is the only source \nof investment return that increases accumulated capital. The key is to recognize that TSR is a multi-period \nmeasure that assumes dividends are fully reinvested in the stock. Because investors commonly use dividends \nto consume and dividends are frequently taxable, a small minority of shareholders earn the TSR.    \n \nThere is a value conservation principle associated with buybacks. The value of a firm declines by the amount \nof capital it disburses. Buying back shares that are over- or undervalued creates offsetting winners and losers. \n"

Finally, if you own the shares of a \ncompany buying back stock, doing nothing is doing something.

      "text": "May 3, 2016  \n \nThoughts on Dividends and Buybacks \n6 \nAppendix A: The Perils of Asset Growth (or Why Paying Out Capital Is Good) \n \nOne of today\u2019s concerns is that companies are paying out too much to investors, whether in the form of \ndividends or buybacks.14 Companies must find an appropriate balance between investing in the business and \nreturning cash to shareholders. The extremely low interest rates that prevail today make financial engineering \nvery attractive, as increases in earnings per share are sure, immediate, and easy to calculate.   \n \nBut on one point the empirical evidence is quite clear: companies that have rapid asset growth have lower \nrisk-adjusted TSRs than companies with slow asset growth. Finance scholars studied the topic and conclude, \n\u201cThe findings suggest that corporate events associated with asset expansion (i.e., acquisitions, public equity \nofferings, public debt offerings, and bank loan initiations) tend to be followed by periods of abnormally low \nreturns, whereas events associated with asset contraction (i.e., spinoffs, share repurchases, debt \nprepayments, and dividend initiations) tend to be followed by periods of abnormally high returns.\u201d15 This also \napplies to 40 markets outside the U.S.16  \n \nThere are a couple of theories that may explain this finding. One is that investors underestimate the degree of \nempire building. As earnings releases reveal that returns on investment are below expectations, the TSRs for \ncompanies with high asset growth are relatively poor.17  \n \nAnother theory is that companies pay less attention to their prospective return on investment and more to the \nperceived cost of capital.18 Companies invest more when they perceive that the cost of capital is low and less \nwhen they perceive it is high. Assuming that the return on investment is relatively stable, this theory predicts \nthat asset expansion leads to subpar TSRs.  \n \n \n"

If you seek to maximize value over one period, \nthe proper method is to find the highest arithmetic return. This is where mean-variance maximization is \nappropriate. If you are parlaying your capital so that your investment sum at the end of one period becomes \nthe starting sum of the next, you want to consider geometric mean maximization. See Javier Estrada, \n\u201cGeometric Mean Maximization: An Overlooked Portfolio Approach?\u201d Journal of Investing, Vol. 19, No. 4, \nWinter 2010, 134-147. For a less technical discussion, see William Poundstone, Fortune\u2019s Formula: The \nUntold Story of the Scientific Betting System that Beat the Casinos and Wall Street (New York: Hill and Wang, \n2005), 197-201.   \n5 Alfred Rappaport, \u201cDividend Reinvestment, Price Appreciation and Capital Accumulation,\u201d Journal of Portfolio \nManagement, Vol. 32, No. 3, Spring 2006, 119-123. \n6 Jeremy J. Siegel, Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns and Long-\nTerm Investment Strategies, Fifth Edition (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2014), 76.  \n7 As an empirical matter, the stock price doesn\u2019t go down by the exact amount of the dividend because of the \nimpact of taxes. The basic equation to determine how much a stock will drop when it goes ex-dividend is as \nfollows: \n \n \n \n \nPb \u2013 Pa = (1-to) \n \n \n \n     D  \n \n(1-tcg) \n \nWhere Pb is the stock price before the ex-dividend date, Pa is the price after the ex-dividend date, to is the tax \nrate on dividend income, and tcg is the tax rate on capital gains. So if the tax rates on dividends and capital \ngains are the same (as they are today), then the decline in the stock price is roughly equivalent to the dividend. \nIf the tax rate on dividends is higher than that on capital gains, which has been true for most of the last half \ncentury, then the decline in stock price will be less than the dividend. See Aswath Damodaran, \u201cReturning \nCash to the Owners: Dividend Policy,\u201d available at \nhttp://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/ovhds/ch10.pdf.  \n8 For example, see David Trainer, \u201cHow Stock Buybacks Destroy Shareholder Value,\u201d Forbes, February 24, \n2016, and Ritholtz (2016). \n9 See exhibit 8 in Michael J.
