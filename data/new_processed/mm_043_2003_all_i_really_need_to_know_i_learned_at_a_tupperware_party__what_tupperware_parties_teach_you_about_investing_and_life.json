      "text": "Anybody familiar with the workings of a Tupperware party will recognize the use of various\nweapons of influence . . .\nRobert Cialdini\nInfluence: The Psychology of Persuasion 1\nTupperware . . . developed what I believe to be a corrupt system of psychological manipulation.\nBut the practice . . . worked and had legs. Tupperware parties sold billions of dollars of\nmerchandise for decades.\nCharlie Munger\nCharlie Munger Speaks-Part 2 2\nA Tip from Shining Shoes\nNearby our old office building, the window of a shoe store advertised the generous offer of a\nfree shoeshine. I walked by this store dozens of times and thought nothing of it. One day,\nthough, with my shoes looking a little scuffed and some time on my hands, I decided to avail\nmyself of this small bounty.\nAfter my shine, I offered the shoeshine man a tip. He refused. Free was free, he said. I climbed\ndown from the chair feeling distinctly indebted. \u201cHow could this guy shine my shoes,\u201d I thought,\n\u201cand expect nothing?\u201d\nSo I did what I suspect most people who take the offer do\u2014I looked around for something to\nbuy. I had to even the score, somehow. Since I didn\u2019t need shoes, I found myself mindlessly\nperusing shoetrees, laces, and polish. Finally, I slinked out of the store empty-handed and\nuneasy. Even though I had managed to escape without pulling out my wallet, I was sure many\nothers weren\u2019t so fortunate.\nA topic that is fascinating in investing (and in life) is why humans act the way they do. A few\nmonths after my sweat-on-the-brow-inducing shine, I read Robert Cialdini\u2019s Influence: The\nPsychology of Persuasion, a book that provides many of the answers to this question.\nCialdini\u2019s work over the past three decades has concentrated on what induces a specific form\nof behavior change: compliance with a request. Cialdini argues that six tendencies of human\nbehavior spur a positive response to a request. 3 All these tendencies are important to\nunderstand for life, and a few of them are particularly important for investors.\nAs I read Cialdini I realized that the shoe store was preying on an essential rule of human\nconduct\u2014the code of reciprocity. If someone gives you something, you feel that you must give\nsomething in return. If you want to use this innate tendency to your advantage, you give\nsomething small and ask for something large in return. A two-dollar shoeshine for two-hundred-\ndollar wing tips is a good trade.\nWe will take a brief look at each of the six tendencies, discuss how party sellers use them, and\nhighlight the three tendencies most important for investors.\nMichael J. Mauboussin\n212-325-3108\nmichael.mauboussin@csfb.com\nKristen Bartholdson\n212-325-2788\nkristen.bartholdson@csfb.com\nFebruary 25, 2003\nVolume 2, Issue 4\nAll I Really Need to Know\nI Learned at a Tupperware Party\nWhat Tupperware Parties Teach You about Investing and Life\n"

      "text": "Page 2\nYou Can Fool Mother Nature\nHere are the six tendencies\u2014reciprocation, consistency, social validation, liking, authority, and scarcity\u2014\nalong with brief descriptions. While Cialdini does not strongly stress the point, we believe these tendencies\nare deeply rooted in evolutionary psychology. Each behavior likely contributed to the reproductive success of\nour forebears.\n\u2022 \nReciprocation. We\u2019ve already encountered reciprocity. Research shows that there is no human\nsociety that does not feel the obligation to reciprocate. 4 Companies make ample use of this\ntendency, from charitable organizations sending free address labels to real estate firms offering free\nhouse appraisals.\n\u2022 \nCommitment and consistency. Once we have made a decision, and especially if we\u2019ve validated that\ndecision through public affirmation, we\u2019re loath to change our view. Cialdini offers two deep-seated\nreasons for this. First, consistency allows us to stop thinking about the issue\u2014it gives us a mental\nbreak. And second, consistency allows us to avoid the consequence of reason\u2014namely, that we\nhave to change. The first allows us to avoid thinking; the second allows us to avoid acting.\n\u2022 \nSocial validation. One of the main ways we make decisions is by observing the decisions of others. 5\nIn a famous illustration of this point, psychologist Solomon Asch put a group of eight subjects in a\nroom and showed them a series of slides with vertical lines of various lengths. He asked the group\nto identify which line on the right matched the length of the one on the left. (See Exhibit 1.) The\nanswer was obvious, but Asch instructed every member of the group, save one, to give the same,\nwrong answer.\nThe subjects, bright college students, were clearly confused and one-third of them went with the\nmajority view even though it was obviously incorrect. While extreme, Asch\u2019s experiment shows how\nwe all rely to some degree on what others do. 6\nExhibit 1: The Asch Experiment\nA\nB\nC\nA\nB\nC\nSource: Duncan J. Watts, Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2003), 207.\n\u2022 \nLiking. We all prefer to say yes to people we like. We tend to like people who are similar to us, who\ncompliment us, cooperate with us, and who are attractive.\n\u2022 \nAuthority. In one of the most enlightening and unsettling human experiments ever, social\npsychologist Stanley Milgram (of six degrees of separation fame) had subjects come in and play the\nrole of \u201cteacher\u201d for a \u201clearner.\u201d The subjects asked the learner questions, and were told by a stern,\nlab-coated supervisor to administer progressively stronger electric shocks in return for incorrect\nanswers. The learners would scream in pain and beg for mercy to avoid the increasingly painful\nshocks. Even though they were never forced to do anything, nor were they subject to reprisal, many\nof the subjects ended up doling out lethal shocks.\nThe learners in this experiment were actors and the shocks fake, but Milgram\u2019s findings were real\nand chilling: People obey authority figures against their better judgment. Here again, the behavior\ngenerally makes sense\u2014authorities often know more than others about their field\u2014but such\nobedience can lead to inappropriate responses. 7\n"

      "text": "Page 3\n\u2022 \nScarcity. Evidence shows humans find items and information more attractive if they are either\nscarce, or perceived to be scarce. Companies routinely leverage this tendency by offering products\nor services for a limited time only.\nThese tendencies are singularly powerful. But when they are invoked in combinations, they are even more\npotent and create what Charlie Munger calls lollapalooza effects. (Yes, lollapalooza is in the dictionary.)\nAll I Really Need to Know . . .\nThe seemingly innocuous Tupperware party, which according to The New York Times is \u201cback with a\nvengeance\u201d in the affluent suburbs of New York City, captures such lollapalooza effects. 8 The Tupperware\nparty takes advantage of four of the six tendencies. This is big business: Tupperware generates annual\nsales of about $1 billion from its in-home \u201cconsultants.\u201d\nFirst is reciprocity. Early in the party, there is a quiz game that allows participants to win play money that\nthey can \u201cspend\u201d on giveaway items. Each participant is also encouraged to share with the group the uses of\nproducts she has already purchased\u2014evidence of commitment. Once the buying starts, each transaction\ndemonstrates that others want the product, providing social validation.\nBut perhaps the single most important facet of the Tupperware formula is the tendency to say yes to people\nyou like. The purchase request comes not from a stranger, but rather a friend. Indeed the Tupperware\nhandbook counsels the salespeople to use the \u201cfeel, felt, found\u201d method, effectively encouraging similarity\nthrough empathy while still highlighting product features.\nCombine these effects, and it\u2019s not hard to see why many people try to avoid going to a Tupperware party in\nthe first place, because they know that once they are there, they will buy something. For example, the Times\nreported that one attendee spent \u201cfar more than she had planned,\u201d no doubt swept up by the lollapalooza\neffect.\nThe Psychology of Investing\nInvestors need to pay a great deal of attention to what influences their behavior. Three of Cialdini\u2019s six\ntendencies are particularly relevant for investors: consistency and commitment, social validation, and\nscarcity.\nPsychologists discovered that after bettors at a racetrack put down their money, they are more confident in\nthe prospects of their horses winning than immediately before they placed their bets. 9 After making a\ndecision, we feel pressure (both internal and external) to remain consistent to that view, even if subsequent\nevidence questions the validity of the initial decision.\nSo an investor that has taken a position in a particular stock, recommended it publicly, or encouraged\ncolleagues to participate, will feel the need to stick with the call. Related to this tendency is the confirmation\ntrap, post-decision openness to confirming data coupled with disavowal or denial of disconfirming data. One\nuseful technique to mitigate consistency is to think about the world in ranges of values with associated\nprobabilities versus single points. Acknowledging multiple scenarios provides psychological shelter to\nchange views when appropriate.\nA large body of work about the role of social validation in investing exists. Investing is an inherently social\nactivity, and investors periodically act in concert. Awareness of breakdowns in the diversity of opinion and\nrespect for extreme valuations can help offset the deleterious impact of social validation.\nFinally, scarcity has an important role in investing (and certainly plays a large role in the minds of corporate\nexecutives). Investors in particular seek informational scarcity. The challenge is to distinguish between what\nis truly scarce information and what is not. One means to do this is to reverse-engineer market\nexpectations\u2014in other words, figure out what the market already thinks.\n"
