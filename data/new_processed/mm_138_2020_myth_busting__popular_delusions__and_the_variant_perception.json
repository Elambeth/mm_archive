It\u2019s a real pleasure for me to join you today, as these \nroundtable sessions always prompt me to organize my thoughts on \nimportant topics. This morning\u2019s theme is a particularly interesting \none because it provides an opportunity to critically examine some \nissues that are often understood superficially. \nI should mention that I first participated in a session with the \nRoundtable 15 years ago, and was on a panel with the great \neconomist, historian, and author, Peter Bernstein. I said then that I \nwanted to grow up to be like Peter Bernstein. Fifteen years later, I \nhave aged but I have not grown up! \nI will address four myths or popular delusions: \n\uf0b7 The first one relates to short-termism. You hear a lot of fretting \nabout the deleterious impact of short-termism, without a lot of \nconcrete evidence for its existence. We\u2019ll critically examine \nsome of the arguments to see if they hold water;  \n\uf0b7 The second is the idea that dividends play a large role in equity \nreturns over time. I will demonstrate that price appreciation is \nthe only source of investment return that increases \naccumulated capital; \n\uf0b7 Third is the notion that investing in money-losing companies is \na bad idea. It can be a bad idea, but much more nuance is \nnecessary; and \n\uf0b7 The final one relates to the idea that the rise of indexing has \nmade it easier to be an active manager. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

We\u2019ll define it as the tendency to make decisions that \nappear beneficial in the short term at the expense of decisions that have a higher payoff in the long term. This \ntends to come in two flavors, investor short-termism and managerial short-termism.1 \nIt is easy to find concerns about short-termism throughout history\u2014I have examples that go back decades. But \na quote from a Harvard Business Review article captures the current mood: \n\u201c. . . the shadow of short-termism has continued to advance\u2014and the situation may actually be getting \nworse. As a result, companies are less able to invest and build value for the long term, undermining \nbroad economic growth and lowering returns on investment for savers.\u201d2 \nLet\u2019s look at three aspects of this. The first is why some shortening of time horizon may be fully justified by the \neconomic facts. For example, consider the rate of diffusion of new technologies: it took 71 years for one-half of \nthe U.S. population to get a telephone, 18 years for a color television, and 10 years for internet access. As these \ndiffusions speed up, so does change.3 \nAnother is asset lives. The asset lives for technology companies are generally 6-7 years, whereas asset lives \nfor energy and materials companies are roughly 17-18 years. As the composition of the economy and the stock \nmarket have shifted away from asset-heavy to asset-light industries over the past 30 years, the average asset \nlife has shrunk. Further, it turns out that governance scores, as calculated by Credit Suisse HOLT, are highest \nfor industries with the longest asset lives and lowest for businesses with the shortest asset lives. \nThe most fundamental way to assess the market\u2019s short-termism is to look at asset prices themselves. It is easy \nto find pundits who suggest the stock market is overvalued, and this notion is backed by evidence such as the \nCAPE ratio.4 \nThat alone should give some pause to those arguing for short-termism: high valuations mean the market is \nrecognizing and paying for cash flows many years into the future. It\u2019s the very opposite of short-termism. \nHere\u2019s a simple exercise I do with my students at Columbia Business School to make this point. I take five stocks \nfrom the Dow Jones Industrial Average and calculate the present value of the dividends they are expected to \npay over the next 5 years, according to estimates by Value Line (see exhibit 1). That value represents only 11 \npercent of the prevailing equity value, which means that more than 90 percent is for cash flows beyond 5 years. \nAssume buybacks that are as large as dividends and you still only get to about 20 percent. In other words, most \nof the value is reflected in long-term cash flows. \nExhibit 1: Percentage of Value Attributable to Dividends beyond the Next Five Years \nCompany \nPrice, \n12/31/2019 \nCumulative Present \nValue, Next 5 Years \nof Dividends \nPercentage of \nShare Value \nBeyond 5 Years \nAmerican Express \n $124.49  \n $9.01  \n     92.8%  \nCoca-Cola \n     55.35  \n   7.89  \n 85.7  \nMerck \n     90.95  \n 12.72  \n 86.0  \nMicrosoft \n   157.70  \n 11.37  \n 92.8  \nProcter & Gamble \n   124.90  \n 14.49  \n 88.4  \nAverage \n \n \n 89.1 \nSource: Value Line Investment Survey. \nThese opinions and forecasts are those of its author and may not actually come to pass.

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3088039 Exp. 05/31/2021 \n3 \n \nPerhaps the most popular argument for short-termism is the holding period of money managers. For example, \nMichael Porter, a professor known for his work on competitive strategy, noted that \u201cthe average holding period \nof stocks has declined from over seven years in 1960 to about two years today . . . it is perhaps the most telling \nevidence of shortening investor horizons.\u201d5 \nPorter is indeed correct: portfolio turnover was much lower in the 1950s and 1960s than in recent times.6 But \nyou might ask why that is. \nA long-term chart of portfolio turnover shows a spike starting on May 1, 1975 (see exhibit 2). That was the day \ncommissions on stock trading were deregulated. To give you some sense of the situation, the cost of trading \n10,000 shares of a $40 stock was $0.43 per share. And, of course, bid-offer spreads were expressed in eighths. \nSo the cost of trading was vastly higher, hence limiting activity.7 \nExhibit 2: Portfolio Turnover, 1946-2019 \n \nSource: Bogle Financial Markets Research Center and Investment Company Institute. \nNote: U.S.-based mutual funds; Annual turnover rate is weighted by assets. \nPortfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers. Portfolio \nturnover is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the amount of securities sold - \nwhichever is less - over a particular period, divided by the total net asset value of the fund. \nFurther, turnover is actually down in the last 20 years. The latest reading of asset-weighted turnover is 25-30 \npercent, the lowest since the 1970s.8 Now there are entities that trade frequently, but they are only around \nbecause the cost to trade has come down so much. For example, index funds weren\u2019t viable prior to 1975 \nbecause of cost. \nIt\u2019s also worth noting companies such as Amazon.com have taken a long-term view and have been rewarded \nby the market. The idea that a company that has been public for 23 years is loved only because it trained its \nshareholders doesn\u2019t really fit the narrative of short-termism.9 \nLet me finish this point with a couple of thoughts. I recognize that managers and investors feel pressure to deliver \nshort-term results. All of us who seek to have successful long-term careers also feel short-term pressure\u2014and \nthat\u2019s because the long term is an aggregation of short terms. The key is to do the right thing. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n1946\n1950\n1954\n1958\n1962\n1966\n1970\n1974\n1978\n1982\n1986\n1990\n1994\n1998\n2002\n2006\n2010\n2014\n2018\nTurnover Rate (Percent)\n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3088039 Exp. 05/31/2021 \n4 \n \nSecond, the reason investor holding periods are shorter than the number of years of cash flows reflected in stock \nprices is that investors make short-term bets on long-term outcomes.10 If you want to understand the market\u2019s \ntime horizon, do not look at, or talk to, the investors. Look at the market, which is a product of all investors.11 \nII. The second myth is about the role of dividends in capital accumulation. In a paper he co-authored, Peter \nBernstein wrote, \u201cThese data put the lie to the conventional view that equities derive most of their returns from \ncapital appreciation, that income is far less important, if not irrelevant.\u201d12 A large investment management firm \nput out research that was ever more emphatic, stating, \u201cSome may be surprised to learn that 90 percent of U.S. \nequity returns over the last century have been delivered by dividends and dividend growth.\u201d13 Yes, that would \nbe surprising\u2014especially if it were true. \nLet\u2019s take a step back. The reason we save, or defer current consumption, is to accumulate capital to satisfy \nfuture liabilities, whether it\u2019s paying for a child\u2019s college education or retiring comfortably.  \nWhen we discuss the stock market in general or specific stocks, we often refer to \u201ctotal shareholder return\u201d \n(TSR), which assumes that dividends are reinvested with no friction. Here is the equation to calculate TSR: \nTSR = g + (1 + g) * d \nIn this equation, g stands for the stock price appreciation rate and d stands for the dividend yield.  \nThe focus on TSR can lead to a couple of points of confusion.14 \nThe first is that almost no one earns the TSR for a stock that pays a dividend. In order to do so, you must have \nan automatic dividend reinvestment plan with zero taxes. The number of people who fall into this camp are de \nminimis. Most people spend the dividends they receive, and most funds allow the sum simply to go to cash. So \none should be very careful relying on past TSRs to plan for the future.  \nThe second is the belief that dividends are the main driver of investment performance. In reality, price \nappreciation is the only source of investment returns that increases accumulated capital.  \nTo understand this, let\u2019s slow down the process. Say you have a $100 stock that pays a $3 dividend. The day \nthat dividend is paid, you have a stock worth $97 and a dividend worth $3 (the stock is actually marked down on \nthe ex-dividend date). You earn the TSR only if you reinvest the full $3 into the stock to restore your investment \nto $100. From there, it is clear that price appreciation is the driver of accumulated wealth. \nYour capital accumulation is a function of how much you invest, how long you invest, and price appreciation. By \nthe way, there is also massive confusion about share buybacks, which I won\u2019t go into now.  \nI will add that there is very robust evidence about the relationship between asset growth and TSRs. Companies \nthat have grown assets rapidly have tended to deliver poor returns, whereas those that have grown modestly, \nor even contracted, have done well. So returning capital to shareholders is important.15 \nOne last note: much of what I\u2019ve just discussed about dividends is summarized in a paper that was published in \nthe Journal of Portfolio Management in 2006 by my mentor, collaborator, and friend, Al Rappaport. Peter \nBernstein read the paper and called it \u201cmasterful\u201d and wondered out loud why no one had pointed out this \nanalysis to him before. Bernstein was still open to learning at the age of 86! \nIII. The third myth is about companies that lose money. Jay Ritter, a professor of finance and a leading authority \non initial public offerings (IPO\u2019s), reports that 74 percent of companies that did an IPO in 2019 lost money, which \nis about where the level was in 1999, near the peak of the dot-com bubble.16 Further, about 40 percent of listed \n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3088039 Exp. 05/31/2021 \n5 \n \ncompanies in the U.S. lose money\u2014all this against a backdrop of a solid economy.17 The implication is that \nthings have returned to a frothy state\u2014and certainly the saga of WeWork fanned the flames of that narrative. \nHere\u2019s a short quiz for you: what if I offered you shares of a company just listed on the New York Stock Exchange \nand told you with absolute certainty it would have negative free cash flow for each of the next 15 years. Would \nyou buy it? \nWell, there was a little company like that and it was called Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. From the beginning of 1972 \nthrough the end of 1986, Walmart generated TSRs of 33 percent versus the S&P 500\u2019s 11 percent. Investors in \nWalmart would have ended the period with almost 16 times more capital than investors in the broader market.  \nWalmart was such a good stock because it earned a very high return on its investments. In those cases, you \nwant a company to invest as much as it possibly can\u2014even if the investment is larger than earnings and the \ncompany has to access external sources of capital to do so.  \nSo what does that have to do with what\u2019s going on now? There has been a watershed change in the form in \nwhich companies invest. In 1977, tangible investment was 2 times that of intangible investment. Today, \nintangible investment is 1.5 times tangible investment (see exhibit 3). Tangible investments appear on the \nbalance sheet; intangible assets tend to appear on the income statement as an expense.18 \nExhibit 3: The Rise of Intangible Investments, 1977-2017 \n \nSource: Unpublished update to Corrado and Hulten (2010) using methods and sources developed in Corrado and Hao \n(2013) and in Corrado et al. (2016) and Corrado et al. (2017) for INTAN-Invest\u00a9 and the SPINTAN project, respectively. \nThe SPINTAN project was funded by the European Commission FP-7 grant agreement 612774. \nNote: Nonresidential business investment relative to business sector gross value added. \nSo what\u2019s the solution? If you want apples-to-apples comparisons, you must capitalize the investments that are \nnow on the income statement. In other words, put them on the balance sheet as we used to. The immediate \nimpact is that earnings and book value both go up.19  \nThis relates to the challenging time for value investors, who tend to build portfolios that rely on statistical factors \nsuch as price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples. Baruch Lev and Anup Srivastava, professors of \naccounting, made these adjustments and found that 40-60 percent of stocks that had been classified as \u201cvalue\u201d \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\nInvestment as a Percentage of \nGross Value Added\nIntangible\nTangible\n"

Further, they found that the adjustments lead to factors with much better signals \nfor building portfolios.20 \nThis also addresses the concern that companies are underinvesting and returning too much money to \nshareholders. If investments on the income statement are properly categorized, firms have actually been \nincreasing their operating investments over time. \nI believe this myth has created opportunity for investors who are willing to roll up their sleeves to really \nunderstand unit economics.21 If you knew how good Walmart\u2019s store economics were, you would have stood \nbehind them applauding as they spent more on investments than they earned in income. Likewise, some \ncompanies today are losing money but have extremely attractive economics, and others are losing money the \nold-fashioned way\u2014with bad business models. \nIV. I hear a lot of successful investors say that the rise of indexing has made it easier to be an active manager. \nSeth Klarman, the founder and CEO of the Baupost Group whom I admire deeply, echoed this refrain when he \nsaid, \u201c[Indexing] should give long-term value investors a distinct advantage. The inherent irony of the efficient \nmarket theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more \ninefficient the market is likely to become.\u201d22  \nOn the surface, this sounds like a plausible case: fewer people are competing and less information is finding its \nway into markets, hence it\u2019s easier to express your skill by finding mispriced assets. But I think the opposite may \nbe true, and here\u2019s why. \nA good starting point is \u201cThe Arithmetic of Active Management\u201d by professor of finance and Nobel-Prize winner, \nBill Sharpe.23 The idea is simple: Before costs, the return on the average actively managed dollar will equal the \nreturn on the average passively managed dollar. And after costs, the return on the average actively-managed \ndollar will be less than the return on the average passively-managed dollar. \nNow this isn\u2019t by itself any revelation for active managers. Alpha before fees is zero by definition. What is \nimportant is that for you to earn positive alpha, someone on the other side of your trades has to earn negative \nalpha.  \nTo make this more vivid, imagine that I invite you to my house Friday night to play poker, and let\u2019s assume that \nyou want to make some money. Upon receiving the invitation, your first question should be, \u201cWho else will be \nthere?\u201d  \nIf I tell you there will be some rich people who are much worse players than you are, you\u2019ll immediately make \nplans to join me. There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll win, but over time your skill will allow you to take money from those \npatsies. \nOn the other hand, if I tell you that the players who are coming over are all better players than you are, you \nshould arrange some alternative plans. In this case, it should be clear that you are the patsy\u2014which is not good \nif you like to keep your money.24 \nI think the poker story carries over well to the investment management industry. My conjecture is that the \ninvestors who have turned to indexing are on average the weaker players.  \nTo stretch this analogy, the weak players are sitting at your poker table drinking your beer but are not playing\u2014\nso they can\u2019t win or lose. And the reason I mention that they are drinking your beer is because they really are \n"

So active management fees \nsubsidize the index management industry. \nSo if my argument is reasonably accurate, you are left playing the stronger players, making it harder, not easier, \nto generate risk-adjusted excess returns, or alpha. And while there\u2019s little doubt that indexing has and will create \ndistortions in markets, there remain a substantial number of active managers at the ready to arbitrage those \nopportunities.  \nIn summary, I want to encourage you to always go back to first principles when considering what the pundits \nsay or assert.

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3088039 Exp. 05/31/2021 \n9 \n \nRisk Considerations \n \nPredictions are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass.  \nThere is no assurance that the techniques mentioned in this article will be successful in helping improve the \naccuracy of predictions. \n \nThere is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, \nwhich is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value \nof Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing \nin this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities \nsecurities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets \nentail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in \nemerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. \nPrivately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly \navailable information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell \nthem (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant \nimpact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market \nrisks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk).  \n \n \nDISTRIBUTION \nThis communication is only intended for and will only be distributed to persons resident in jurisdictions where \nsuch distribution or availability would not be contrary to local laws or regulations. \nIreland: Morgan Stanley Investment Management (Ireland) Limited.
