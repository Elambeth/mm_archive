A \ncompany\u2019s stock is worth the present value of the cash flows it will \ngenerate for its owners until it is no more. Valuation approaches, \nwhether based on simple multiples or elaborate discounted cash \nflow (DCF) models, generally assume a company will exist in \nperpetuity. \nTake a price-earnings multiple of 18 as an example. We can \ntranslate that into a simple valuation model by assuming the cost \nof equity is 9 percent, earnings are a proxy for distributable cash, \nand that the company will grow at a 3.5 percent rate forever \n(18=1/(.09-.035)).1 Discounted cash flow models are more \ncomplicated, but it is common for most of the value to come from \nthe continuing value, which captures what happens after the \nexplicit forecast period ends. Methods to estimate the continuing \nvalue often assume business results that are more of the same.2 \nA thoughtful valuation requires confronting some empirical \nrealties: most companies do not live that long and do not generate \ngood returns for shareholders while they are alive.  \nFor this discussion, a company is \u201cborn\u201d when its stock starts \ntrading on a public exchange and \u201cdies\u201d when it stops trading \nthere. We also examine the time between when founders \nincorporate a company and when it is born. And a company can \ndie for a good reason, such as being acquired at a large premium, \nor a bad reason, including going bankrupt. Roughly one-half of \npublic companies have traded for ten years or less over the last \ncentury. \nHendrik Bessembinder, a professor of finance at Arizona State \nUniversity, has documented an extraordinary pattern of wealth \ncreation in public equity markets.3 Nearly 60 percent of companies \nthat have been public in the U.S. over the last century or so have \nfailed to create value, defined as earning total shareholder returns \nin excess of one-month Treasury bills. And only 2 percent of \ncompanies were responsible for more than 90 percent of the \naggregate net wealth creation. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

But these patterns of longevity and value creation are worthy of \nattention. They hold for international markets as well and are consistent with regularities found in other studies \nof the social sciences.4  \nThese concepts have particular relevance for valuation and portfolio construction. For valuation, it may be time \nto revisit the basic construction of a DCF model, which typically includes an explicit forecast period plus a simple \nestimate of continuing value, and tailor projections of cash flows to reflect these observed patterns.5 Researchers \ndeveloped the concept of continuing value nearly a century ago, when computation was slow and costly.6 Today, \ndata and technology are relatively inexpensive and allow for a richer exploration of possible end states rather \nthan a simple extrapolation of results following a forecast period. \nThe data on wealth creation suggest two strategies for portfolio construction. One is to recognize that an investor \ncan capture the skewness, or asymmetry of a distribution, in long-term total shareholder returns by holding a \ndiversified portfolio. Index funds are an effective way to implement this approach. While an index will include \nstocks with poor returns, it will also have the handful of companies that generate most of the aggregate value.  \nThe other strategy is to build a relatively concentrated portfolio that seeks to include the companies that have \nthe potential to generate high returns and avoid those that do not.7 We will share some insights into the \ncharacteristics of the winning businesses and their stocks.         \nIn this report, we examine how companies are born and how long they live, why they die, and patterns of \nshareholder returns. We focus primarily on the last half century of results in the U.S. and note waves in both \ninitial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that may not repeat. We also discuss how the \ncomposition of the U.S. market has changed over the decades and what that means for investors.  \nHow Many Companies Are Born and How Long Do They Live?  \nWe start the discussion on the demographic trends of public companies in the U.S. with a review of how the \npopulation has changed over time. Exhibit 1 shows the number of public companies in the U.S. from 1976 to \n2022. There were just under 4,800 listed companies in 1976, the total rose to more than 7,300 at the peak in \n1996, and the sum has descended to a little more than 4,200 companies today.  \nThe FT Wilshire 5000 IndexSM attempts to include all stocks that trade actively in the U.S., weighted by market \ncapitalization. Wilshire Associates, an investment management consulting firm, launched the index in 1974 and \npicked the number \u201c5000\u201d to match the investable universe. That index had more than 7,000 constituents at one \npoint in the 1990s but only 3,478 as of March 31, 2023.8 There were fewer public companies in the U.S. in 2022 \nthan there were in 1976 notwithstanding that the population in 2022 was 1.5 times that of 1976, real gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita was 2.2 times higher, and the number of firms was roughly 1.5 times greater.9 \nThe \u201clisting gap\u201d is the difference between how many public companies are listed and an estimate of how many \nshould be listed, given the size of the population and economy as well as listings in other countries. Researchers \nestimate the gap in the U.S. is 5,800 to 12,200 companies.10    \n \n \n \n"

But they are big and important. \nFor example, the combined sales of the top 100 public companies were nearly 7 times those of the top 100 \nprivate companies in 2021.11 And the market capitalization of the U.S. stock market was 1.5 times GDP at the \nend of 2022. This ratio is off its all-time high but remains well above the long-term average. \nWe can track births and deaths to see how the demographics of public companies have changed, just as we do \nwith figures for the population of humans.

Ritter and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Includes IPOs with an offer price of at least $5.00 and excludes American depositary receipts, unit offers, closed-end \nfunds, real estate investment trusts, special purpose acquisition companies, natural resource limited partnerships, small \nbest-efforts offers, banks and savings and loan associations, and stocks not listed in the Center for Research in Security \nPrices database. \nTwo big waves are apparent, from 1980 to 1987 and 1991 to 2000. There were previous IPO waves in 1959-\n1961 and 1968-1969. In fact, there were 780 IPOs in 1969 alone, which is 18 percent of the total number of \npublic companies today.12 Ritter\u2019s data show only 39 IPOs in 2022, the fewest since 2008 when the economy \nwas in the throes of the Great Recession. \nA SPAC is another way for a company\u2019s stock to become publicly listed. SPACs represented 11 percent of the \nbirth of public companies from 1976 to 2022 but were a signifcant factor for new listings in 2021 and 2022. \nA sponsor creates a SPAC and raises capital via a public offering with the intention of merging with a company \nthat is not public. Once a merger is complete, the operating company is a listed public company. A SPAC that \nfails to find a suitable target within a designated time, usually two years, is liquidated and the sponsor returns \nthe pool of capital to the holders.13 Ritter does not count a SPAC as an IPO because it is uncertain whether it \nwill remain as a listed company.  \nThere was a modest wave of SPACs in 2005-2007, with 124 deals, but the market really took off in 2020 and \n2021, when there were 861 offerings. To put that into context, the deals that came to market in those two years \nwere about two-thirds of the total number of SPACs ever issued.14  \nExhibit 3 shows the number of SPAC IPOs from 2009 through the first half of 2023 as well as the number that \ncompleted or announced a merger, were liquidated, or are still searching for a deal. Of the 613 SPAC IPOs in \n2021, the peak year of issuance, 209 have liquidated. There were more than 110 liquidations in the first half of \n2023, continuing the trend.15 The number of SPAC IPOs overstates the birth of public companies even though \na majority of SPACs end up as listed companies.  \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\n2022\nNumber\n"

A spin-off is when a public company distributes \nshares of a wholly-owned subsidiary to its shareholders on a pro-rata and tax-free basis. For example, General \nElectric, a conglomerate, announced in late 2021 that it intended to split into three companies by doing two spin-\noffs.

Along with 2008, this was one of the only two times \nthis has happened in the last half century.  \nOur calculation of the number of public companies in the U.S. follows the approach of Craig Doidge, Andrew \nKarolyi, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, professors of finance.16 We take the total number of companies and delistings each \nyear, and calculate the number of new listings that reconciles the annual change. While our number of new \nlistings varies somewhat from those in the Ritter data, the two series are highly correlated.17 \nThe primary explanation for the lower birth rate of U.S. public companies in the 21st century is the sharp decline \nin IPOs. For example, from 1976 to 2000 there were 282 IPOs per year, on average. Since 2000, that average \nhas dipped to 124. The main question is why the rate of IPOs has dropped so much in recent decades.  \nWe can analyze the inclination of private companies to go public by assessing the costs and benefits. The costs \ninclude exchange fees, regulatory requirements, loss of confidentiality as the result of disclosure, and investor \nrelations. Further, management often feels that being public creates an expectation to achieve short-term \nfinancial results, invites media scrutiny, and introduces the possibility of having shareholders that may be \ndemanding. On balance, these are fixed costs and have gone up over time.  \nThe benefits of listing include access to equity capital for internal uses or acquisitions, transparency and \nenhanced liquidity for stock-based compensation programs, a stock price that reflects current market \nexpectations, and coverage by research analysts.  \nDoidge, Karolyi, and Stulz consider these costs and benefits and conclude that the propensity to go public in \nrecent years is roughly one-half of what it was in the mid-1990s.18  \nOther factors affect the decision to list. Private companies have had more access to capital in recent decades \nthan they did before. For example, investments in private companies by mutual funds and hedge funds rose \nsharply in the 2000s and 2010s.19 In the fall of 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the National Securities Markets \nImprovement Act, which deregulated key securities laws. This allowed investors more flexibility to invest in \nprivate companies.20  \nIncreasing regulatory burdens, including expanded disclosure requirements for the boards, management, and \naccounting firms of public companies in the U.S. as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, also contributed \nto the costs of being public.21 But it does not appear that these costs are decisive in the choice to list.22  \nResearch suggests that large companies have gained strength relative to small companies in recent decades.23 \nThe evidence shows that it is more difficult than it used to be for small companies to become medium or large, \nand that the gap in profitability between small and large companies has been growing.24   \nThat small companies face limited mobility and profitability means that they may be better off as part of a big \ncompany. This is consistent with economies of scope, the idea that overall costs can come down as companies \nexpand their offerings. In recent decades, many small companies found it more attractive to sell their business \nto a big company than to go public.25 Companies have to be larger, on average, to cover the costs of going public \nthan they had to be in prior decades.  \nAnother consideration is the liquidity demands of mutual funds, which are the predominant buyers of IPOs. \nAcademics suggest that the turning point was in 1998, following the devaluation of the Russian ruble and the \nAsian financial crisis in the prior year. The argument is that mutual funds were willing to participate in small IPOs \n"

For example, small IPOs were 56 percent of deals from 1994-1998 \nbut only 13 percent from 1999-2003.26  \nCompanies have been waiting longer to come public than they used to as a result of the higher costs of being \npublic, greater access to private capital, limited mobility, and demand for liquidity. Exhibit 5 shows the median \nage at IPO from 1976-2022. That figure was 7.9 years from 1976 to 2000 and rose to 9.5 years from 2001 to \n2022.  \nExhibit 5: Median Age at IPO, 1976-2022 \n \nSource: Jay R. Ritter and Counterpoint Global. \nOne implication of companies staying private longer is that wealth creation has shifted to private markets from \nthe public markets. Importantly, not all investors have access to private markets. To illustrate the point, Amazon\u2019s \nmarket capitalization was $749 million when it went public in 1997 and $1.3 trillion as of June 30, 2023 (in 2022 \ndollars). The company was three years old when it did its IPO. Essentially all of its wealth creation occurred \nwhen it was public. Meta Platforms\u2019s market capitalization was $133 billion when it went public in 2012, 8 years \nafter its founding, and $622 billion as of June 30, 2023 (in 2022 dollars). The company was called Facebook \nwhen it went public but changed its name to Meta Platforms in 2021. One-fifth of the company\u2019s wealth creation \noccurred as a private company. \nWe now look at how long companies live, defined as the time from new listing to delisting. Exhibit 6 shows the \nlongevity of nearly 23,000 companies that have been public since 1926, based on data from Hendrik \nBessembinder. The horizontal axis reflects age at death, and the vertical axis is frequency.

But financial deals, where a \nfinancial sponsor acquires a public company in a buyout, have been on the rise since 2000. Investors call this \nasset class \u201cprivate equity\u201d because buyout firms own companies that are not public. Exhibit 11 shows M&A \nprivate equity buyouts as a percent of total delistings due to M&A from 1977 to 2022.

In fact, it is usually better to be \na seller than a buyer.31 The seller commonly receives a premium to its stock price before the deal is announced \nand lives on as part of another company.  \nExhibit 12 shows the median annual deal premium from 1985 to 2022. The premium is defined as the percentage \nthe buyer offers in excess of the seller\u2019s stock price five days prior to the announcement. The median premium \nis 29 percent over the full period. The average premium is closer to 45 percent and tends to be higher when \nthere are multiple bidders.32  \nSellers can negotiate from a position of strength or weakness.33 Companies with strong prospects for growth \nand profitability can often command a large premium, especially when the buyer provides resources that allow \nthe seller to improve its prospects for value creation. Meta Platforms\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, which at the \ntime had no sales and about a dozen employees and no revenue, for $1 billion in 2012 is an example.

For \nexample, the New York Stock Exchange requires a stock to sustain a price of at least $1.00, have 400 or more \nshareholders, and maintain a market capitalization of no less than $15 million. Delisting as a result of failure to \nmeet requirements often leads to a drop in stock price and higher transaction costs through an increase in the \nbid-offer spread.34  \nA voluntary delisting is the least common explanation. This happens when a company decides that the cost of \nbeing public outstrips the benefit and is consistent with the thesis that the size threshold of listing has been on \nthe rise. The stocks of some of these companies continue to trade but are no longer registered with an exchange. \nThe mix of the size of public companies has changed a great deal since the mid-1970s. The full span from 1976 \nto 2022 can be broken into two parts that are roughly equal. From 1976 to 2000, there were lots of IPOs that \nincluded many small companies. From 2001 to 2022, the number of annual IPOs was less than one-half of the \nprior period with few small companies. This change, combined with ongoing M&A and higher costs associated \nwith regulation, suggests that we should now see fewer small companies that are public.35 \nThis is the case. Exhibit 14 shows the mix of mega-, mid-, small-, and micro-capitalization companies from 1976 \nto 2022.36 Mega-capitalization companies were 7 percent, and micro-capitalization 56 percent, of the total \nnumber of public companies at the peak in 1996. In 2022, mega stocks were 13 percent and micro stocks just \n33 percent of the total. More than 2,000 of the vanishing companies had micro capitalizations, defined as \ncompanies that make up two percent of the aggregate value of the U.S. stock market.   \nExhibit 14: Mix of Mega-, Mid-, Small-, and Micro-Cap U.S. Public Companies, 1976-2022 \n \nSource: Center for Research in Security Prices and Counterpoint Global. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1976\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nPercent of Total\nMicro\nSmall\nMid\nMega\n"

Second, a company that has recently completed an \nIPO may become a target of a buyer or an acquirer itself. Finally, entrepreneurs and early investors can compare \nthe value in the public and M&A markets to determine which is a more attractive way to monetize ownership. \nThese exit alternatives compete with one another assuming the seller wants to attain the highest value. \nBirths and deaths are related in other noteworthy ways. For instance, the delisting rate is different following an \nIPO in a \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d market.38 A hot market is characterized by a high volume of deals, strong investor \ndemand, and apparent IPO underpricing leading to sharp gains in the first day of trading. The IPO market in \n1999 and 2000 is a good illustration. According to Jay Ritter, there were 476 IPOs in 1999 with an average return \nin the first day of 57.4 percent (weighted by proceeds) and another 380 in 2000 with a return of 45.8 percent.39   \nA cold market is the opposite of a hot one: low volume, limited demand, and subdued gains. The years 2001 \nand 2002 are an example. There were 80 IPOs in 2001 with an average gain of 8.4 percent and 66 in 2002 with \na return of 5.1 percent. IPO volume and gains in the first day of trading were down more than 80 percent in \n2001-2002 versus 1999-2000. A large majority of IPOs occur in hot markets. \nThis is relevant because the delisting rate is higher for companies that come public during hot markets than it is \nfor those during cold markets. One study found that 41 percent of companies that listed in a hot market had \ndelisted within 5 years, whereas that rate was 30 percent for IPOs during cold markets. Further, of the companies \nthat delisted, M&A was responsible 60 percent of the time in hot markets and 70 percent in cold markets.40 \nAnother relevant consideration is the risk of death, either due to failure or takeover, as a function of age and \nsize.41 On the one hand, young companies may appear vulnerable because they have yet to fully establish their \nplace in the market and to achieve consistent profitability. Older companies, by contrast, have been successful \nand are established organizations. Researchers call the risks faced by young companies the liabilities of \nnewness and adolescence.42 \nOn the other hand, older companies may appear more susceptible to death because their structures have \nbecome rigid and they are less innovative.43 Further, the capital raised in an IPO may provide a new company \nwith resources to weather early competitive and organizational storms. The hazards for older companies are \ncalled the liabilities of senescence and obsolescence.  \nThe empirical data do not reveal an easy answer. A number of studies show that the risk of death declines with \nage, although the pattern is not always linear.44 Another analysis shows that \u201cmortality rates for publicly traded \ncompanies are approximately age independent.\u201d45 Academics have built models that seek to integrate the \nhazard rates across the life of a company.46 One noteworthy result is that companies with low stock prices, \nindependent of market capitalization, have a higher mortality rate than companies with higher prices.47   \nA final thought on birth and death, although not limited to public companies, is the pattern they follow during the \nindustry lifecycle.48 The simple version is that there is substantial entry as an industry emerges, with new firms \ntrying out novel products and processes in order to capture a share of the growing economic pie. Once the \nmarket settles on certain products and processes, there is little entry and substantial exit. The final number of \ncompanies in the industry ends up being relatively small.  \n"

Examples include manias and subsequent crashes in the U.K. canal stocks in the 1790s, the U.K. railway \nstocks in the 1840s, and the internet stocks in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Each marked an epoch of \nsubstantial birth followed by sweeping death.49  \nNot only are there fewer public companies than in the past but those that exist today are on average much older \nand larger than they were previously. We estimate the average age of a listed company went from 12 years in \n1996 to nearly 20 years in 2022.50  \nOver the same period, the average market capitalization for companies in the S&P 500, an index that tracks the \nperformance of the 500 largest U.S. listed companies, went from $21 billion to $78 billion (in 2022 dollars) and \nthe median market capitalization went from $9 billion to $30 billion.

At the end of the day, however, investors care about \nthe returns that they earn. This requires returning to the work of Hendrik Bessembinder on the pattern of value \ncreation, and considering how births and deaths relate to those results. \nOver the long term, a small percentage of companies create most of the aggregate wealth in the stock market. \nIn statistics, skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution and kurtosis reflects the fatness of the tails, or \nnumber of extreme values. Long-term equity returns for firms are positively skewed and have high kurtosis.53 \nBessembinder studied roughly 28,100 public companies in the U.S. that have been listed since 1926.54 He \ndefined wealth creation as earning a return higher than one-month Treasury bills. He found that about 16,500, \nor just under 60 percent of the sample, destroyed $9.1 trillion in value through December 2022. The other 11,600 \nor so, slightly more than 40 percent, created $64.2 trillion in value. Of the net wealth creation of $55.1 trillion, \nmore than $50 trillion was attributable to just 2 percent of the sample. The top 3 (\u00bd of 1 percent of the 2 percent), \nApple, Microsoft, and ExxonMobil, alone added almost $6 trillion.  \nExhibit 16 shows the age and total wealth created by the top 20 wealth creators from 1926 to December 2022. \nAge is the number of years the company has traded publicly since 1926.

First, Bessembinder\u2019s \ncalculation translates relative total shareholder gains and losses from percentages into dollars. This is akin to \nthe relationship between ROIC (percentages) and economic profit (dollars) in the study of corporate results.55  \nActive investors focus predominantly on the percentage changes in their portfolios measured relative to \nappropriate benchmarks. A portfolio manager will consider two distinct positions of the same size that outperform \na benchmark by 10 percentage points over equal timespans to be equivalent, all else being constant. But if the \nbeginning market capitalization of the first company is $3 trillion and that of the second is $30 billion, the wealth \ncreation in the first case is 100 times that of the second.56 Investors need to consider dollar changes only when \nthe size of the deployable assets is sufficiently large relative to the asset class.   \nSecond, the leader board of wealth creation can reflect outperformance from decades ago. Return to exhibit 16 \nand focus on the companies in the bottom right corner. The stocks of many of these companies have been \nlaggards for decades, yet they still appear high on the list because of how they did long ago. For instance, \nExxonMobil, IBM, General Electric, and General Motors are in the top 20 in part because of the performance of \ntheir stock in the 1950s. These were large capitalization companies that did well enough to allow them into the \nwealth creation hall of fame.  \nThe pattern of wealth creation is not limited to the U.S. Bessembinder and his co-authors do a similar analysis \nof nearly 47,000 stocks outside the U.S., which include those in 26 developed and 16 developing economies. \nThe period they examine, 1990 to 2020, is shorter, but the full sample of non-U.S. and U.S. stocks exceeds \n64,000. They find essentially the same result outside the U.S. as they do inside it: 55-60 percent of stocks \nunderperform Treasury bills and a small fraction of stocks produce the vast majority of the value. Indeed, these \nfeatures are even more pronounced outside the U.S.57 \nThese results appear highly relevant for long-term shareholders. But investors can lose sight of these extreme \noutcomes because they are a consequence of compounding over lots of years. Further, while returns for \nindividual stocks exhibit positive skewness, returns for the aggregate stock market have negative skewness.58  \nEven investors with long investment horizons, including endowments and pension funds, tend to evaluate results \nover periods that are too short for the revelation of the full effect of compounding.59 Bessembinder uses some \nsimplified assumptions to show how portfolio concentration and the frequency of rebalancing affect skewness. \nHigh concentration and infrequent rebalancing lead to high skewness.60 Long-term returns for investment funds \nalso convey different information than short-term returns.61  \nThis raises another issue. Most institutional money managers have a fiduciary responsibility to put the interests \nof clients first. This commonly includes guidelines for portfolio diversification and risk management. For example, \nstocks that compound at a high rate can become too large in a mutual fund portfolio and violate parameters for \ndiversification, market capitalization, or risk that are described in the fund prospectus.62 Index funds, for the most \npart, do not have this problem.63 Most of the richest people in the U.S. have the vast majority of their wealth in \na single asset, usually the stock of the company they founded or of which they are large owners.64   \nThe counterpoint is that the list of the top wealth creators is based on what they have done rather than what they \nmay do. Exhibit 17 shows the annual wealth creation for Microsoft from its IPO in March 1986 to December \n2022. The aggregate wealth creation is nearly $2.1 trillion, placing the company number 2 on the total wealth \ncreation list as of 2022.

These included 74 percent from May \n1983 to August 1985, 80 percent from February 1992 to December 1997, and 79 percent from March \n2000 to March 2003. Apple was the top wealth creator through the end of 2022, but most investors \nwould have struggled to hold the shares through these declines. The shares of Amazon offer another \ncase, having suffered a drawdown of more than 91 percent from February 2000 to September 2001 on \ntheir way to being among the best wealth creators. \n\u2022 \nNot just technology.66 While companies in the information technology sector may come to mind first \nwhen considering the top wealth creators, Bessembinder found that these companies were \nunderrepresented among than the best. Sectors that were overrepresented among the winners included \nhealthcare and energy. Industries with high variance in return on invested capital tend to be represented \namong the top and bottom groups in wealth creation.  \n\u2022 \nCommon characteristics of the winners.67 Bessembinder considered a slew of financial metrics to \nassess which ones, if any, were consistent with substantial wealth creation. Large increases in net \nincome, rapid asset and sales growth that the company generated internally, a rising return on assets, \nabove-average research and development (R&D) spending, and cash accumulation were among the \ncharacteristics of the top wealth creators. An investor can measure these characteristics objectively, \nand they may help anticipate good and bad prospects for wealth creation.68 \n-1,000\n-800\n-600\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nWealth Creation ($ Billions)\n"

All rights reserved. \n5820305 Exp. 7/31/2024 \n19\n \n \nFinally, we turn to the relationship between company earnings, stock returns, and corporate demographics \nthrough a remarkable study of more than 16,300 firms that started trading after the beginning of 1975.69 The \nauthors, Sanjeev Bhojraj, Ashish Ochani, and Shiva Rajgopal, are professors of accounting who wanted to know \nif the price the stock market sets as a public company is born is an accurate reflection of future earnings.  \nThey separated the IPOs into companies that survived as public companies, those that merged, and those that \ndelisted for other reasons. They then examined whether the present value of its actual future earnings could \njustify the price at which the stock closed on the day of its IPO. They discounted the earnings by the cost of \nequity, calculated as the risk-free rate plus an estimate of the market risk premium. They used the yield on the \n10-year Treasury note as the risk-free rate, estimates of the market risk premium from Aswath Damodaran, a \nprofessor of finance, and made no additional adjustments for risk.70 They also ran the figures using free cash \nflow versus earnings and found similar, albeit lower, values. \nIn the case of survivors, they calculated the value of the actual earnings and added a terminal value. For those \ncompanies that merged, they assumed the acquisition price. For delisted companies, they used the earnings \nplus the liquidating dividend paid to the last shareholders if relevant.  \nExhibit 18 summarizes the results. They found that the \u201caverage lifetime earnings at the aggregate level slightly \nexceeds first day price,\u201d which is reflected in the 1.1 mean, or average, ratio in the bottom row of the exhibit. \nFirms that merged, which make up the largest percentage of the sample, drove most of this outcome. Further, \nthe medians were greatly lower than the means, indicating substantial skewness. Nearly two-thirds of the \ncompanies failed to generate sufficient earnings to justify their stock prices on the first day. \nExhibit 18: Mean and Median Lifetime Earnings to First Day Stock Price, 1975-2020 \nCategory \nNumber \nMean \nMedian \nSurviving \n2,757 \n1.5 \n0.4 \nMerged \n6,963 \n1.9 \n1.1 \nDelisted (Non-Merged) \n6,666 \n0.1 \n0.0 \nTotal \n16,386 \n1.1 \n0.3 \nSource: Sanjeev Bhojraj, Ashish Ochani, and Shiva Rajgopal, \u201cLifetime Earnings,\u201d Working Paper, October 2022 and \nCounterpoint Global. \nThe authors explicitly link their analysis of lifetime earnings to Bessembinder\u2019s work on wealth creation. They \nfind that lifetime earnings are \u201cpositively associated\u201d with future wealth creation. They also note that past wealth \ncreation, based on returns, has a negative correlation with subsequent wealth creation. They conclude that while \nprice and value may diverge in the short to medium term, they tend to converge in the long term.  \nConclusion \nInvestors seeking to generate excess returns can benefit from understanding the demographics of public \ncompanies and their pattern of wealth creation.71 There were nearly 3,100 more listed companies in the U.S. at \nthe peak in 1996 than in 2022. This means there were fewer new listings than delistings over that time. \nAcademics that compare the U.S. to other markets suggest there is a gap between how many companies are \nlisted and how many should be listed of 5,800 to 12,200 companies.  \nNew listings are generally the result of IPOs, and the number of deals from 2001-2022 was not even half of what \nit was from 1976-2000. A strong wave of SPACs in 2020, and especially 2021, lifted the number of listed stocks. \n"

All rights reserved. \n5820305 Exp. 7/31/2024 \n20\n \n \nBut about one-third of the SPACs launched in 2021 have liquidated and another one-quarter are still searching \nfor a deal.  \nDelistings are primarily the consequence of M&A or cause, which means the company went bankrupt or failed \nto meet listing requirements. About two-thirds of the delistings were companies with micro-capitalizations, \ndefined as the smallest two percent of listed companies as measured by market capitalization. The loss of these \nlistings has a very limited impact on the investable universe, but the mean and median market capitalization of \npublic companies has risen in the last two decades as a consequence. \nAbout one-half of all public companies since 1926 have delisted within 10 years of their listing. Corporate \nlongevity, which considers a listing as a birth and delisting as death, follows an exponential function, which \nmeans that a constant change in age has the same percentage change in the probability of death. Counter to a \npopular narrative of shrinking corporate longevity, we find that survival rates have increased in the 2000s and \n2010s relative to the 1980s and 1990s. \nHendrik Bessembinder, a professor of finance, has measured the wealth creation of more than 28,000 U.S. \nlisted companies since 1926. A company creates wealth if it generates returns in excess of one-month Treasury \nbill rates. He found that from 1926 to 2022, just under 60 percent of them destroyed $9.1 trillion and the other \n40 percent or so created $64.2 trillion. Just 2 percent of the sample created $50 trillion of the net total of $55.1 \ntrillion, and the top 3 firms (Apple, Microsoft, and ExxonMobil) created almost $6 trillion.  \nThese results reveal skewness, which measures the asymmetry of a distribution, that is eye-popping. But it is \nimportant to recognize that this calculation translates gains and losses in relative total shareholder returns from \npercentages into dollars. Active managers focus mostly on generating percentage returns, adjusted for risk, that \nare better than those of their benchmarks. Further, some of the leading wealth creators as measured today, \nincluding IBM and General Motors, reflect total shareholder returns and market capitalizations from decades ago. \nThese results have relevance for investors as they consider valuation and portfolio construction. Most investors \nacknowledge the value of a business is the present value of its future cash flows and assess value using \nmultiples or a DCF model. But even for a DCF model, the more sophisticated of the two approaches, most of \nthe value is commonly reflected in the continuing value. The continuing value seeks to represent the value \nfollowing the explicit forecast period and often assumes business results that are more of the same.72 The data \non the causes of death, hazard rates, and longevity provide investors with context to consider a diverse range \nof possible end states. \nThe skewness in corporate wealth creation suggests two potential investment approaches. The first is to seek \nbroad diversification in an index fund. If the future is similar to the past, the outperformance of the wealth creators \nwill more than make up for the underperformance of the losers.  \nThe second is to build a portfolio that seeks to avoid the wealth destroyers while owning the wealth creators. \nBessembinder finds that the wealth creators have certain financial characteristics that are identifiable, albeit \ndifficult to predict. He also finds that the stocks of many of the top wealth creators suffered major drawdowns, \nevents that often cause all but the hardiest shareholders to sell. He shows that a portfolio\u2019s exposure to the \nskewness is a function of its concentration and rebalancing frequency. Portfolios that are concentrated and do \nnot rebalance often are more exposed to skewness. \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 32-34 \n"

SPACs are typically sold as units, which include a share in the pool of \ncash raised and a warrant (or a fraction of a warrant). Most units trade at $10, and the warrants can be detached \nand traded separately. A warrant is the right but not the obligation to acquire the stock at a set price, often a 15 \npercent premium, or $11.50 per share. The sponsors put the money in a trust account that accrues interest and \nthen tries to find a suitable target. \nThe sponsors have some time, typically two years, to do a deal. If they fail, the sponsors dissolve the SPAC, \nand the holders get their money back plus the interest. When the sponsors identify a merger target, the SPAC \nholders get a stake in the new company. The sponsors receive a sizeable stake in the new entity as \ncompensation for their work. If the deal size is greater than the amount in the pool, the sponsors seek to raise \nthe additional capital through a private investment in public equity (PIPE).  \nOf note, SPAC holders can either take the share in the new company or opt out by redeeming their shares for \nthe $10, plus the interest. Redemption rates were more than 50 percent in 2021 and 2022. For more on SPACs, \nsee Matt Levine, \u201cMoney Stuff: SPAC Magic Isn\u2019t Free,\u201d Bloomberg, January 8, 2021. \n14 Jay R.

ROIC equals net \noperating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by invested capital. Investors commonly compare ROIC to the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) and a company creates value if ROIC is greater than WACC. Economic \nprofit equals ROIC \u2013 WACC \u00d7 invested capital. Two companies with the same ROIC \u2013 WACC spread but \ndifferent amounts of invested capital will result in different economic profits.  \n56 The market capitalizations may be relevant in cases when the benchmark is weighted by market capitalization. \nThis is the case with the S&P 500 Index, which is the benchmark most widely used. Bessembinder\u2019s benchmark \nis the return on one-month Treasury bills, so market capitalization does not play a role. \n57 Bessembinder, Chen, Choi, and Wei, \u201cLong-Term Shareholder Returns: Evidence from 64,000 Global Stocks.\u201d  \n58 Rui Albuquerque, \u201cSkewness in Stock Returns: Reconciling the Evidence on Firm Versus Aggregate Returns,\u201d \nReview of Financial Studies, Vol. 25, No. 5, May 2012, 1630-1673. \n59 Interestingly, in a survey of more than 200 institutional investors that collectively manage more than $4.1 \ntrillion, 68 percent said they invest with a manager for 5 or more years.  \n60 Hendrik Bessembinder, \u201cExtending Portfolio Theory to Compound Returns,\u201d Working Paper, July 2022.  \n61 Hendrik Bessembinder, Michael J. Cooper, and Feng Zhang, \u201cMutual Fund Performance at Long Horizons,\u201d \nJournal of Financial Economics, Vol. 147, No. 1, January 2023, 132-158. \n62 Some funds have operated outside of these constraints. For example, the Nomad Investment Partnership, \nfounded by Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria, at one point reportedly had 40 percent of the fund in Amazon and at \nanother had 16 percent in Costco. See William Green, Richer, Wiser, Happier: How the World\u2019s Greatest \nInvestors Win in Markets and Life (New York: Scribner, 2021). Another case is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment \nin Apple, which represented about 35 percent of the company\u2019s public equity portfolio as of mid-2023. Berkshire \nHathaway had gains of more than $140 billion in its stake in Apple at that time.  \n63 This is not strictly true. For time to time, index providers have to adjust their rules so that funds linked to the \nindex remain compliant with rules about diversification spelled out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission. For example, following strong gains by large technology companies in the first half of 2023, Nasdaq \n"
