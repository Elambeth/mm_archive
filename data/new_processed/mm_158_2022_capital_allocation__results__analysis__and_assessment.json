This entails taking inputs, including capital and labor, \nand making them worth more than their cost over time. Capital \nallocation, which describes how a company raises and spends \nmoney, plays a central role in value creation. Successful capital \nallocation creates lasting value for all stakeholders and can \nachieve other goals as well.1 But management\u2019s ultimate focus \nshould be on increasing long-term value per share.2 \nCreating value ought to be an imperative for at least two reasons. \nThe first is competition. A firm that does a poor job of managing \nits resources will lose in the marketplace to a company that is \nmanaged better. The second is consideration of the opportunity \ncost of capital. Companies have to explicitly acknowledge that all \ncapital has an opportunity cost, the rate of return they could earn \non the next best alternative. Capital that fails to earn the cost of \ncapital over the long term destroys value and imperils a \ncompany\u2019s prospects for prosperity.  \nEven though capital allocation is the most important responsibility \nof the chief executive officer (CEO), not all know how to do it well. \nThis is in large part because the skills that enable someone to \nbecome a CEO may not be the same as those that make that \nperson effective at overseeing how capital is raised, managed, \nand disbursed. Indeed, new CEOs commonly have the same \nfunctional background as the outgoing ones, and the experience \nof most CEOs is in general management.3 \nWarren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the \nmultinational conglomerate, gets to the point: \u201cOnce they become \nCEOs, they face new responsibilities. They now must make \ncapital allocation decisions, a critical job that they may have never \ntackled and that is not easily mastered.\u201d4  \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

For example, \nscholars measured how much capital companies reallocated from one business unit to another, with zero \nindicating that capital spending across divisions was the same as in the prior year and one reflecting complete \nreallocation. They then compared the degree of reallocation to the improvement in return on assets, a measure \nof corporate performance (see exhibit 1). In theory, a company should put capital to its best and highest use \nwithout consideration for how it spent money in the past. \nChanges in the competitive landscape and the prospects of the business units suggest that some reallocation \nis appropriate. The researchers in fact found an optimal degree of reallocation. But they also discovered that \nonly 38 of the 5,760 observations, or less than 1 percent, were above that threshold. In other words, the vast \nmajority of companies could improve their financial performance by increasing their reallocation.5 \nThis behavior is consistent with status quo bias, which suggests that people tend to continue doing what they \nare doing even in the presence of preferable alternatives.6 It is also compatible with the escalation of \ncommitment, the idea that we would rather escalate a commitment to a prior action than change course.7 \nExhibit 1: Capital Reallocation and Incremental Return on Assets  \n \nSource: Based on Dan Lovallo, Alexander L.

All rights reserved. \n6186732 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n4\n \nThere are a handful of factors that keep management teams from allocating capital as well as they could. The \nfirst, simply, is that they do not have a clear and correct process for doing so. Capital allocation is ultimately \nabout assessing opportunities and executing on the ones that are attractive. As such, it requires a willingness \nto be a buyer or a seller given the circumstances. This necessitates some dispassion and analytical agility. \nThe answer to nearly every capital allocation question is, \u201cit depends.\u201d Buying back stock at one price may be a \ngreat way to add value per share for ongoing holders whereas selling it at another price may be desireable.8 A \nstrategic acquisition will add to an acquirer\u2019s value at a certain price but destroy value at a higher one. And \ndivestitures, which many executives find less compelling than acquisitions, can be beneficial for shareholders.   \nValuation is the tie that binds these decisions. The valuation quotient divides a company\u2019s decisions that rely on \nvaluation by its market capitalization. This measures how important valuation is to overall shareholder value.9 \nExhibit 2 shows that the valuation quotient averaged 14 percent from 1985 through 2021. We use the market \ncapitalization of the Russell 3000, which tracks the largest stocks by market capitalization in the United States. \nThe valuation decisions we consider in the numerator include the proceeds from issuance of common and \npreferred stock, total mergers and acquisitions (M&A), cash paid for share buybacks, and total divestitures. We \ndivide the sum of these decisions by the market capitalization at the beginning of the year. For companies with \nhigh valuation quotients, valuation errors limit total shareholder returns (TSR), especially if they span multiple \nyears and capital allocation decisions. \nIn a sense, executives should act like investment portfolio managers in that they allocate capital to opportunities \nthat have the potential to earn excess returns and divest assets that are worth more to others. But capital \nallocation for executives is different than it is for investors in two ways that are meaningful.10 Decisions by \nexecutives are often hard to reverse. For example, unwinding a large acquisition can be costly and time \nconsuming. On the other hand, executives generally have some control over the outcomes for the investments \nthey make. This is because they can shift resources, strategies, and tactics as necessary.  \nExhibit 2: Valuation Quotient, 1985-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet; Counterpoint Global; Alfred Rappaport and Michael J.

These generally reflect the costs that \narise from the principal-agent problem. The goals of the owners of assets, the principals, and those in charge of \nmanaging the assets, the agents, can come into conflict. Shareholders are the principals and executives are the \nagents. For instance, there is a positive relationship between firm size and executive compensation. As a result, \nmanagers may have an incentive to grow through acquisitions even in cases where the deals add no value for \nshareholders. Further, executives may peg their compensation to financial or non-financial metrics that have no \ndirect link to value creation. These actions create \u201cagency costs\u201d for shareholders. \nFinally, there is what Warren Buffett calls the \u201cinstitutional imperative.\u201d11 This says executives will \u201cmindlessly\u201d \nimitate one another in their practices, including compensation and capital allocation, and that junior people within \na firm will be quick to come up with business justifications to support whatever the CEO wants to do.12 \nMorningstar, a financial services firm, provides a Capital Allocation Rating for more than 1,700 companies based \non balance sheet strength, investment acumen, and appropriate distributions to shareholders. Of the companies \nrated as of the end of the third quarter of 2022, 22 percent score high enough in each area to be deemed \nexemplary, 73 percent are standard, and 5 percent rate low enough to be considered poor.13 \nConsideration of where a company is in its life cycle is important in assessing capital allocation (see exhibit 3). \nEmpirical studies show that return on investment improves as a company goes from the early to middle of its life \ncycle, reflecting the absorption of upfront investment. Following a peak, return on investment tends to decline \nfrom the middle to the end of the company\u2019s life cycle as the result of industry maturation and competition.14 \nReflecting this pattern, investment in the business tends to be greatest toward the beginning of the life cycle and \nthe proclivity to return capital to shareholders is higher toward the end.   \nExhibit 3: Stylized Returns Through the Corporate Life Cycle \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global and Victoria Dickinson, \u201cCash Flow Patterns as a Proxy for Firm Life Cycle,\u201d Accounting Review, \nVol. 86, No. 6, November 2011, 1969-1994. \nNote: ROIC=return on invested capital; WACC=weighted average cost of capital. \n \nIntroduction\nGrowth\nMature\nShake-Out\nDecline\nROIC - WACC \nSpread\n"

The first establishes the foundation by reviewing the sources of capital, reviews how \ncapital can be allocated, and shows how companies in the Russell 3000 Index have allocated capital since 1985. \nWe also look at growth and return on invested capital to understand why capital allocation remains an important \nconsideration for executives and investors.  \nNext, we review each of the capital allocation alternatives in more detail. What is new in our work is the inclusion \nof intangible investments, which are undoubtedly important but inherently difficult to measure. We also draw on \nacademic research to gain a synoptic view and, where appropriate, provide a framework for thinking about the \nprospects for value creation. \nFinally, we offer some guidelines for assessing a company\u2019s capital allocation skills. These include examining \nhow the firm has allocated capital in the past, measurement of return on invested capital, consideration of the \nrole of incentives, and five core principles that should guide capital allocation. \nAcademic research has investigated the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for stock prices associated with \nvarious capital allocation alternatives, including M&A, share buybacks, and dividend initiations.15 The CAR \ncalculation tries to isolate the impact of an announcement by removing changes associated with the stock \nmarket. Combining this work with specific research on other forms of capital allocation allows us to create a \nrough ranking of the stock market\u2019s assessment of potential value creation by activity. Note that these summary \nresults do not consider the specific circumstances of each case. In other words, this analysis indicates what \nhappens on average, and individual cases may have very different outcomes.   \nSpin-offs, divestitures, dividend initiations, share buybacks, debt prepayments, capital expenditures, and some \nintangible investments are associated with positive excess TSRs. Research and development (R&D) tends to \nbe value neutral as is M&A for the buyer. And equity issuance, including initial public offerings and seasoned \nequity offerings, predicts negative excess returns on average.  \nAsset growth is a blunt tool that predicts abnormal returns. Specifically, companies with high asset growth earn \nlower TSRs than companies with low asset growth.16 Asset contraction is associated with higher TSRs than \nasset expansion. This empirical observation has been built into multi-factor asset pricing models and is worthy \nof attention.17 But asset growth is ultimately a poor proxy for investment and neglects the rise of investment in \ninternally-generated intangible assets.18 Changes in asset levels fueled either by equity issuance or retirement \nmight explain the broad result.19  \nWe now lay the foundation by reviewing the sources and uses of financial capital, how companies have spent \nthat capital since 1985, and why capital allocation remains an important investment consideration.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6186732 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n7\n \nFoundation: Where the Money Comes From and Where It Goes \nAn assessment of capital allocation begins with an understanding of where capital comes from and how \ncompanies spend it (see exhibit 4).   \nSources of Capital. The source of capital can be external or internal. External capital comes from the issuance \nof equity or debt (including leases). Startups and young companies commonly need to access external capital \nbecause they have to incur and cover costs before they can sell a good or service at sufficient scale to absorb \nthose pre-production expenses. \nExhibit 4: Sources and Uses of Financial Capital \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global.  \nOne way to assess whether a company will require external capital is to compare its growth rate in net operating \nprofit after taxes (NOPAT) to its return on invested capital (ROIC). Firms, young or old, that grow faster than \ntheir ROICs need to access external capital. This is fine, indeed desirable, if the company\u2019s ROIC is in excess \nof the cost of capital.20  \nA classic example is Walmart, a global retailer, which grew faster than its ROIC in its first 15 years as a public \ncompany. The important point is that the company created a lot of value because its ROICs were well in excess \nof the cost of capital. Even though Walmart required external capital to support its growth, the stock delivered \nan annual total shareholder return of 33 percent during that period, three times that of the S&P 500. \nInternal capital comes from the cash that the business generates. This includes cash flow from operations and \nasset sales, which are effectively trading a stream of future cash flows for a lump sum today. In cases where \ngrowth is below the ROIC, the company will have funds available to return to shareholders or to add to the \nbalance sheet.   \nExhibit 5 shows the sources of capital for U.S. corporations since 1980. Internal financing has been the primary \nsource. Companies have also added new debt steadily except for some years when the economy was in \nrecession. This issuance is consistent with a stable capital structure. Debt has also been more attractive in the \nlast dozen years as the result of lower interest rates. \n \n \nCapital uses\nBusiness\nMergers and acquisitions\nInvestment SG&A ex-R&D\nCapital sources\nBusiness\nOperational cash flow\nAsset sales\nCapital expenditures \nInvestment research & development\nNet working capital\nAccess cash \nfrom claimholders\nEquity issuance\nDebt issuance\nReturn cash \nTo claimholders\nShare buybacks\nCash dividends\nDebt prepayment\n"

Note that this analysis does not include \nequity issuance in the form of stock-based compensation (SBC). But net equity issuance is negative for the \nRussell 3000 even after taking SBC expense into consideration.21 \nThat internal financing funds a high percentage of investments can be viewed as a positive or a negative. The \npositive is that the ROIC for public companies in the U.S. is sufficiently high that there is little need to appeal to \ncapital markets to finance growth. The negative is that firms can allocate funds from internal operations to \ninvestments that destroy shareholder value. Raising money from the capital markets allows for scrutiny of a \ncompany\u2019s spending plans. In fact, the evidence shows that healthy capital markets improve capital allocation.22 \nPeter Bernstein, the celebrated economist and financial historian, proposed a mental experiment in which \ncompanies disburse all of their earnings to their shareholders and then ask the markets for funds to invest. His \nthinking was that since markets are better at allocating capital than companies, overall capital allocation would \nimprove as the result of this check by the capital markets.23 \nThe debt-to-total capital ratio is a measure of capital structure, or how companies finance their operations. \nExhibit 6 shows this ratio from 1985 to 2021 for the Russell 3000, excluding companies in the financial and real \nestate sectors. We define the debt-to-total capital ratio as the book value of debt divided by the book value of \ndebt plus the market value of equity. That ratio for 2021 was just under 16 percent versus the long-term average \nof about 31 percent. Note that capital structures have become more conservative in spite of a general decline in \ninterest rates during this period. For example, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note averaged 10.6 percent \nin 1985 and dropped to 1.5 percent in 2021.  \n \n \n \n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nPercent of Total Financing\nNew Equity\nInternal Financing\nNew Debt\n"

Companies can use capital either to invest in the business or to return capital to claimholders. \nInternal investments in the business include capital expenditures, working capital, investment R&D, and \ninvestment SG&A ex-R&D (which is an intangible investment). Firms can also make external investments such \nas M&A. It is important to distinguish between investments that reflect discretionary cash outlays in pursuit of \nvalue-creating growth and spending required to maintain the current operations.24     \nExhibit 7 shows how companies in the United States allocated capital in 2021, both in absolute dollar amounts \nand as a percentage of sales. Total spending was $7.1 trillion. While divestitures are included in this exhibit, \nthey were an inflow of $550 billion of cash.   \nExhibit 8 shows the spending by source since 1985. The data reveal some notable patterns: \n\u2022 \nM&A consistently represents the largest share of the capital that companies allocate. But M&A tends to \nbe very cyclical, matching the ebbs and flows of the economy and the stock market. For example, M&A \nwas as high as 22 percent of sales in 1998 during the dot-com boom and as low as 3 percent of sales \nin 1991 when the U.S. economy was in recession. The average was about 9 percent.  \n\u2022 \nInvestment SG&A ex-R&D is internal spending that creates an intangible asset. Reflecting the steady \nincrease in intangible investment across the economy, this item grew from 5.8 percent of sales in 1985 \nto 7.1 percent in 2021.25 If we add investment R&D, total spending on intangible investment went from \n7.1 to 9.4 percent of sales over the same span of time.    \n\u2022 \nCapital expenditures declined as a percentage of sales from 1985 through 2021, in line with the shift \nfrom tangible to intangible investment. Specifically, capital expenditures were 9.7 percent of sales in \n1985, peaked at 11 percent in 1988, and drifted lower to a trough of 5.4 percent in 2009. Spending has \nsince rebounded a bit and was 5.7 percent of sales in 2021.

For example, the growth in M&A was roughly twice as \nvolatile as that for capital expenditures, and share buybacks were nearly four times as volatile as \ndividends.

A buyout is a transaction where a financial sponsor purchases a company that has strong \ncash flows and finances the deal with a relatively high ratio of debt to equity. The buyer then seeks to improve \noperations, governance, and monitoring, pay down the debt, and sell the company at a profit. \nExhibit 15 shows private equity deals as a percentage of total U.S. M&A volume. The buyout industry had a \nwave of activity in the late 1980s that crashed in the early 1990s and recovered in the decade that followed. \nActivity grew sharply preceding the financial crisis of 2008, again dropped precipitously, and has grown steadily \nsince. Private equity deals have averaged 15 percent of deal volume since 2000 and 12 percent since 1985. \nThey peaked at 29 percent of volume in 2007 and troughed at 2 percent in 1998. \nExhibit 15: Private Equity as a Percentage of Total M&A Volume in the U.S., 1985-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet; Counterpoint Global; Michael Simkovic and Benjamin Kaminetzky, \u201cLeveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the \nProblem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution,\u201d Columbia Business Law Review, Vol. 2011, No. 1, 118, \n2011, Seton Hall Public Law Research Paper No. 1632084. \nCompanies generally attempt to do deals that strengthen their strategic position.31 In fact, most deals have a \nsensible strategic rationale. But deals must also make financial sense to create value for the acquirer. CEOs \nand boards often show hubris by bidding more than they should.32 Even a transaction that makes strategic sense \nmay be a poor capital allocation decision if the price is not right. \nThis is where Warren Buffett\u2019s institutional imperative comes into play. Aspects of the institutional imperative \ninclude having subordinates who are willing to support whatever action a leader wants to take and the tendency \nfor companies to imitate one another, including decisions related to M&A.33 \nAlfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at the Kellogg School of Management, and Mark Sirower, head of the \nMerger & Acquisition Strategy and Commercial Diligence practice at Deloitte Consulting, describe why creating \nvalue in M&A deals is hard for acquirers. The first reason is the risk of paying too much. Even smart strategic \ndeals don\u2019t pay off if the premium is too large for the buyer to recoup its investment.  \nDoing a deal provides a signal of strategic intent and requires effort. In some cases, competitors can recreate \nthe benefits of a deal a company does. They can also capitalize on its lack of focus as the buyer integrates its \ntarget. A seller generally demands a large payment up front for uncertain future benefits, creating justifiable \nskepticism among investors.

All rights reserved. \n6186732 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n16\n \nM&A creates value in the aggregate, measured by comparing the combined equity value of the buyer and seller \nbefore and after the deal. The problem is the value of the acquiring company\u2019s stock often goes down following \nthe announcement of a deal. In these cases, there is a wealth transfer from the shareholders of the buyer to the \nshareholders of the seller. This is the result of the premium buyers pay to sellers to convince them to do a deal.  \nOne recent study of 1,267 deals from 1995 to 2018 showed that the stock price of the buyer went down 60 \npercent of the time upon announcement and that the average change for the full sample was -1.6 percent.35 \nThese aggregates naturally hide a lot of variance. Plenty of transactions create value for the acquirers.   \nThe large body of research on M&A provides base rates that companies and investors can use to find  \nappropriate reference classes. The results of these reference classes provide insight into which types of deals \ngenerally add value. Here are a few of those reference classes:    \n\u2022 \nCash deals do better, on average, than deals funded with equity or a combination of cash and equity.36 \nThe basic idea is that management of the buyer will finance a deal with cash if it thinks the stock of its \ncompany is undervalued and will use stock if it thinks it is overvalued. Cash deals also provide a higher \npayoff for the shareholders of the acquirer if the deal\u2019s economics are attractive.  \n\u2022 \nDeals between companies with similar operations generate healthier results than those that seek to \ntransform the business.37 With operational deals, the core businesses of the target and the acquirer are \nrelated. These are commonly called \u201cbolt-on\u201d deals. Danaher Corporation, a diversified conglomerate, \nis an example of a company that has executed this strategy effectively over the years.38 \nTransformational deals seek to take a company in a radically new strategic direction. These transactions \ntend to create value for the buyer at a rate substantially below the average. One case in point is when \nAOL, a web portal and online service provider, agreed to acquire the media company, Time Warner, for \n$182 billion in 2000.39 \n\u2022 \nCompanies with specialized M&A teams generally outperform those without dedicated professionals.40 \nThese teams are made up of employees who spend the majority of their time analyzing the industry, \ncompetitors, customers, and possible targets. They also value targets and consider potential premiums \nto offer and synergies that may be reaped. A little over one-third of public companies in the U.S. have \nthis type of staff and the deals these companies do are greeted with higher abnormal returns on average. \n\u2022 \nHigher control premiums are associated with lower excess returns and lower premiums with higher \nreturns.41 A premium is how much the buyer is willing to pay above the target\u2019s fair value to own the \nbusiness. It is usually measured as a percentage of the target\u2019s share price unaffected by merger \nspeculation. Premiums tend to rise when the bid is hostile and the target has multiple potential bidders. \nLosers of contested deals have better subsequent stock price results, on average, than the winners.42  \nEvaluating capital allocation alternatives is tricky, and we will suggest a way to assess M&A in a moment. But it \nis worth noting that the accretion or dilution in earnings per share (EPS) after the deal is a point of emphasis for \nmany stakeholders. A survey by Kearney, a consulting firm, showed that investor relations professionals \nperceive EPS accretion to be the metric that executives, sell-side analysts, and investors care about the most \nwhen gauging an M&A deal. Three-quarters of the respondents said that stakeholders place a \u201cstrong emphasis\u201d \non EPS, and only 2 percent reported that it received \u201cno emphasis.\u201d  \nThe perceived importance of EPS accretion or dilution swamped the other metrics.43 There is no empirical \nfoundation for this view. Careful studies show excess returns for the buyer\u2019s stock is essentially independent of \nEPS changes.44  \n"

We then \nexamined the abnormal return for the stock of the buyer following the announcement.  \nWe placed each deal in a box based on a three-by-three grid. The columns captured the anticipated EPS effect \n(negative, neutral, positive) as articulated by management, and the rows reflected abnormal return (negative, \nneutral, positive). The most populated box in the grid, 45 of the 95 deals, was positive EPS and negative \nabnormal return. For these buyers, the earnings went up but the stocks went down.45 \nM&A, like other alternatives for capital allocation, is successful when the value the buyer realizes exceeds the \nprice it pays. Mark Sirower suggests that buyers and investors use this formula:46 \nNet present value of the deal = present value of the synergies \u2013 premium \nIn a nutshell, this formula seeks to quantify whether a buyer is getting more than it pays for. Note that companies \nincreasingly offer synergy estimates, which provide a basis to assess a deal.47 Research shows that the synergy \noften fails to justify the pledged premium.48 But the stock market\u2019s initial reaction is more favorable when the \npresent value of synergies exceeds the premium.49 Let\u2019s look at synergies and premiums. \nThe simple reality is that it is hard to realize synergies.50 While it is possible to define various types of synergies, \none simple breakdown is cost or revenue synergies.51 Most synergies are based on operations, although buyers \ncan capture financial synergies as well.52 The market deems synergies more credible if management shares \nconcrete figures that they explain effectively.53      \nConsistent with this, cost synergies are more reliable than revenue synergies.54 Exhibit 16 shows the results of \na survey by consultants at McKinsey who asked companies whether they achieved their targeted cost and \nrevenue synergies. Thirty six percent of companies reported reaching or exceeding their anticipated cost \nsynergies. Common reasons for coming up short are underestimating one-time costs and a failure to examine \npast deals to guide expectations. \nExhibit 16: Cost Synergies Are More Reliable Than Revenue Synergies \n \n \nSource: Based on Scott A.

Only 17 percent of companies said they surpassed their \nrevenue synergy forecasts. Sources of misplaced optimism include underestimating customer losses and \nunrealistic assumptions about market growth or target market share. It is hard to implement the process \nnecessary to realize sufficient synergies in M&A.55 \nExhibit 17 shows the average deal premium for each year from 1985 to 2021. The average over the full series \nis 45 percent. Each deal in this analysis receives an equal weight. Samples limited to larger deals have average \npremiums closer to 30 percent. The premium is calculated as the difference between the price a buyer pays and \nthe prevailing price of the target prior to any expectation of a deal. For example, if the stock of a target company \ntrades at $100 and a bidder offers $145, the premium is 45 percent ($45/$100). The premium is generally \nstraightforward to calculate for any specific transaction but it can be difficult to aggregate the series of premiums.  \nExhibit 17: Average Deal Premium in the U.S., 1985-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Patrick A. Gaughan, Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructurings-7th Ed. (Hoboken, NJ: John \nWiley & Sons, 2017), 611. \nShareholder value at risk (SVAR) is a useful way to gauge the downside risk for a buyer\u2019s stock price in an M&A \ndeal.56 In a cash deal, SVAR is defined as the premium pledged divided by the market capitalization of the buyer. \nFor example, if a buyer offers a $200 premium to acquire a target and the market capitalization of the buyer is \n$2,000, the SVAR is 10 percent ($200/$2,000).  \nSVAR represents the amount of wealth transfer from the buyer to the seller in the case that the combination has \nno synergies. It gives you a sense of the size of the bet and how much value is at risk. \nSVAR is always higher in a cash deal than a stock deal. In a stock deal, the SVAR is measured as the premium \npledged divided by the market capitalization of the buyer plus the seller (including the premium). To extend the \nprior figures, assume that the deal is now for stock and that the value of the seller before the deal was $800. \nThe SVAR would be 6.6 percent ($200/($2,000 + $1,000)). The insight is that by taking shares instead of cash, \nthe seller is sharing in the risk of achieving the synergies.

In cases where management reveals \ncost synergies, you can take the after-tax synergy guidance and divide it by the cost of capital and compare the \nresult to the premium offered. We have found that this calculation, while imperfect, is vastly more informative \nthan heuristics such as the change in EPS.  \nFinally, you can assess the market\u2019s take on a deal after it digests the news and reflects the opinion of investors. \nThis shows up as changes in stock price for the buyer and seller. Compare the predictions of the market\u2019s \nreaction with what actually happens. For example, the buyer\u2019s stock will trade lower than the formula suggests \nwhen the market is skeptical about the ability of the buyer to achieve its stated synergies. For acquisitions that \nare material, deeper analysis of potential synergies offers the opportunity for a differentiated opinion on a stock.  \nManagement teams and investors sometimes dismiss the feedback from market returns, suggesting that they \nare short-term oriented and hence uninformative. We return to the study of 1,267 deals that was recently \npublished. The analysis included deals between public companies, with purchase prices of $100 million or more, \nand where the value of the seller was at least 10 percent that of the buyer. The sample includes all of the deals \nannounced from 1995 to 2018 that met these criteria. \nExhibit 19 shows the results. First, the market greeted 508 of the deals, or 40 percent, with an average initial \nresponse of +7.7 percent. The market\u2019s average initial response to the other 60 percent of the deals was -7.8 \npercent. These are calculated by measuring the total return, adjusted for the industry, from five days before the \nannouncement to five days after.  \nOne noteworthy point is the success rate of buyers has improved over time. The authors of this study broke the \nsample into three time periods. From 1995-2002, buyers saw positive returns 36 percent of the time. From 2003-\n2010, that ratio rose to 40 percent. In the final period, 2011 to 2018, acquirers saw their stock go up 44 percent \nof the time. This is consistent with other research showing better returns for buyers in M&A since the end of the \nfinancial crisis of 2008-2009.59  \nExhibit 19: Short- and Long-Term Results for Selected M&A Deals in the U.S., 1995-2018 \n \nSource: Based on Mark Sirower and Jeff Weirens, The Synergy Solution: How Companies Win the Mergers and Acquisitions \nGame (Boston, MA: Harvard Business Review Press, 2022), 7.    \nNumber \nof Deals\nPercent \nof Deals\nAnnounce-\nment Return\nOne-Year \nReturn\nPremium\n290\n23%\n8.0%\n32.7%\n26.6%\n508\n40%\n7.7%\n  8.4%\n26.9%\n1,267\n100%\n-1.6%\n-2.1%\n30.1%\n759\n60%\n-7.8%\n-9.1%\n32.2%\n495\n39%\n-9.0%\n  -26.7%\n33.8%\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nRelative Total Shareholder Return (Percent)\nAnnouncement \nPeriod\n1 Year\nInitial \nPositive\nInitial \nNegative\nFull Sample\nInitial Positive, All\nInitial Positive, \nStayed Positive\nInitial Negative, All\nInitial Negative, \nStayed Negative\nFull Sample\n"

In recent decades, there has been a marked shift from tangible to intangible \ninvestment. For example, in the U.S. tangible investment was roughly double that of intangible investment in the \n1970s, and in recent years that ratio has flipped.60 Analysis that decomposes the market value of firms suggests \nthat 26 to 68 percent of the value is attributable to intangible capital.61 \nMost discussion of capital allocation focuses on tangible investment, including capital expenditures and working \ncapital. Tangible assets are those that you can touch. Intangible assets are nonphysical. Examples include \nsoftware code, marketing to build a brand, customer acquisition costs, and employee training (see exhibit 20).   \nExhibit 20: Categories of Intangible Assets \nBroad category \nType of investment \nType of legal property that might be created \nComputerized \ninformation \nSoftware development \nPatent, copyright, design intellectual property \nrights (IPR), trademark, other \nDatabase development \nCopyright, other \nInnovative property \nR&D \nPatents, design IPR  \nMineral exploration \nPatents, other \nCreating entertaining and \nartistic originals \nCopyright, design IPR \nDesign and other product \ndevelopment costs \nCopyright, design IPR, trademark \nEconomic \ncompetencies \nTraining \nOther \nMarket research and branding \nCopyright, trademark \nBusiness process re-\nengineering \nPatent, copyright, other \nSource: Based on Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake, Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy \n(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017), 44. \nMeasuring tangible investments is relatively straightforward because they show up on the statement of cash \nflows and balance sheet.

This is not without basis, as research shows the \npayoffs for R&D are more uncertain than those for capital expenditures.65 That said, there is now a large body \nof evidence confirming that recasting financial statements to reflect intangible investments improves their \nusefulness to explain asset prices.66 \nThe way to put tangible and intangible investments on equal footing is to capitalize intangible investments on \nthe balance sheet and to amortize them over time. The amortization expense appears on the income statement.   \nThe main challenge is determining how much of SG&A is a discretionary intangible investment and how much \nis a maintenance expense necessary to sustain current operations. But the challenge does not stop there. Once \nyou estimate the investment and create an internally-generated intangible asset, you need to assign useful lives \nto the assets to amortize them. This allows for tangible and intangible investments to be treated the same way. \nAcademics are actively researching methods to isolate intangible investment from SG&A and to estimate useful \nlives.67 The most common approach is to assume that all of R&D, and 30 percent of SG&A excluding R&D, is \nan intangible investment.68 Some more recent research tailors the estimates for intangible investment and asset \nlives by industry.69 Intangible-intensive industries have large adjustments to their financial statements while \ntangible-intensive industries see little change.70  \nTo estimate investment SG&A ex-R&D, we take the aggregate SG&A for companies in the Russell 3000, \nsubtract R&D, and apply the investment percentage estimated by Aneel Iqbal, a PhD candidate in accounting, \nand Shivaram Rajgopal, Anup Srivastava, and Rong Zhao, professors of accounting.71 Exhibit 21 shows the \nresults.

The first is maintenance capital \nexpenditures, the minimum spending required to maintain or replace the long-term assets in place. The second \nis investment spending in pursuit of growth that creates value. Investors who are surveyed say they want to be \nable to separate maintenance and growth capital expenditures.75   \nMany investors operate with the simple assumption that depreciation is a reasonable proxy for maintenance \ncapital spending. That makes sense because accountants record the cost of an asset on the balance sheet and \nthen estimate its useful life to determine a depreciation schedule. For instance, if a company pays $1,000 for a \nmachine that has a 5-year life, the company will depreciate $200 per year over that time in order to match \nrevenue and expense. If depreciation approximates maintenance needs, only the capital expenditures above \ndepreciation are an investment. \nInvestment capital expenditures were roughly 35 percent of overall capital expenditures over the full period. That \nmaintenance is essential explains a good deal of the stability of capital expenditures. Further, it suggests that in \nassessing the value creation prospects of capital expenditures, you are best served to focus on the component \nthat supports growth. Academic research shows that the distinction is useful for investors.76  \nExhibit 25 shows capital expenditures minus depreciation for the population we studied. Using this measure, \ninvestment as a percentage of sales peaked in 1988 at 6.9 percent and bottomed in 2020 at 0.5 percent of sales. \nThe average of the past decade was 1.8 percent. \nExhibit 25: Capital Expenditures Net of Depreciation for the Russell 3000, 1985-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nThe two substantial limitations to using depreciation as a proxy for maintenance capital expenditures include \ninflation and the risk of technological obsolescence. In periods of rising prices (such as 2022), the capital \nexpenditures required to replace new equipment will exceed depreciation because new expenditures reflect \ninflation whereas depreciation is based on historical costs.77 Technological obsolescence introduces the \nlikelihood that depreciation overestimates an asset\u2019s useful life.  \nVenkat Peddireddy, an assistant professor of accounting at China Europe International Business School, \ndeveloped a framework to measure maintenance spending called \u201ccumulative capacity cost.\u201d This is the sum of \ndepreciation and amortization (D&A), asset write-downs, loss on the sale of assets, goodwill impairment, and \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\n2019\n2021\nAs a percentage of sales\nAmount ($ Billions)\nAmount (left axis)\n% of sales (right axis)\n"

By including write-downs, losses, and impairments, this \nmeasure reflects evidence for technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. \nPeddireddy concludes that depreciation understates maintenance capital expenditures by about 20 percent (see \nexhibit 26). This percentage varies substantially by industry and there are certainly additional differences for \nindividual companies within the industries. We believe Peddireddy\u2019s approach has some limitations but that \nthere are sensible approaches to breaking capital expenditures into maintenance and growth parts.78 \nExhibit 26: Amount That Maintenance Capital Expenditures Exceed D&A, 1974-2016 \n \nSource: Venkat Ramana Reddy Peddireddy, \u201cEstimating Maintenance CapEx,\u201d PhD Thesis\u2014Columbia University, 2021. \nOverall, announcements of capital expenditure increases tend to be well received by the stock market.79 This \nsuggests they are deemed to be value creating. But the reception to capital expenditure guidance relies to a \nlarge degree on the set of perceived opportunites.80 Like many capital allocation options, the benefits appear to \nfollow the shape of an inverted U. Too little and too much spending is bad, and there is an optimal level for \ncreating value.81 \nResearch and Development. R&D is largely an intangible investment. Research is dedicated to innovation that \nallows for the introduction of new products or services. Development focuses on the process of making those \nproducts or services attractive to the market.  \nIn the U.S., businesses account for about 70-75 percent of total R&D spending, the federal government 20 \npercent, and academia and other entities the other 5-10 percent.82   \nU.S. businesses spend 20-25 percent of their R&D budget on research and 75-80 percent on development.83 \nThe information technology and healthcare sectors spend the most on R&D. In contrast, about 60-65 percent of \nthe federal government\u2019s R&D budget is dedicated to research and only 35-40 percent to development. \nConsistent with the fact a large majority of R&D spending is on development, researchers have argued that the \nentirety of R&D should not be considered a discretionary intangible investment.84 One recent study suggested \nthat about 75 percent of R&D should be deemed an investment using a weighted average of all industries.

Productivity is inherently difficult to measure because of the lag between investment and outcome. We \nlike the distinction between \u201cR&D efficiency,\u201d the cost to launch, and \u201cR&D effectiveness,\u201d the value per launch. \nEfficiency is closer to research and effectiveness to development.  \nThe company that is good at bringing a product to market may be different than the company that can create \nvalue through better capabilities in design, marketing, or distribution.86 This helps explain why large \npharmaceutical companies, which have R&D effectiveness, acquire small ones that have demonstrated R&D \nefficiency. \nOverall, the evidence suggests the returns to R&D have been declining in recent decades.87 Anne Marie Knott, \na professor of strategy at Washington University in St. Louis, developed a metric she calls \u201cresearch quotient\u201d \n(RQ). RQ uses a production function to measure the percentage increase in revenue (output) from a one percent \nincrease in R&D (input), holding other variables constant.88  \nHer analysis suggests that about one-third of companies spend below the optimal level of R&D and have the \nopportunity to create value by spending more. Nearly two-thirds spend too much and can cut costs without \njeopardizing value. She deems five percent of her sample to be close to optimal. Knott notes that activist \ninvestors are pretty good at identifying companies that overspend on R&D.89  \nRQ adds value as a measure of innovation and a determinant of value.90 RQ underscores the idea that the right \namount to spend on any of the capital allocation alternatives depends on the prevailing conditions.91 Average \nraw RQ has been declining in recent decades, indicative of deteriorating returns to R&D spending.  \nTaking a step back, long-run growth associated with innovation is a function of the number of researchers and \ntheir productivity. One thread of research shows that while research effort continues to increase, research \nproductivity is decreasing.92 For example, maintaining Moore\u2019s Law, the doubling of the number of transistors \non microchips every 2 years, requires 18 times the researchers today as it did in the early 1970s.93 \nThe real R&D cost to bring a drug to market has risen steadily over the decades, which provides additional \nevidence for the decline in returns associated with R&D.94 Some accounting professors suggest their research \nshows \u201cstrong evidence of a declining relation between R&D and future profitability.\u201d95 \nNet Working Capital. Net working capital is a measure of how much capital a company needs to operate under \nnormal conditions. It is defined as current assets minus non-interest-bearing current liabilities (NIBCLs). \n\u201cCurrent\u201d means the item is expected to be either an inflow or an outflow of cash in the next twelve months. \nCapital allocation focuses on the change in net working capital as a measure of incremental investment. \nNet working capital has lost significance as a factor in capital allocation in recent decades because there is less \nof it. Net working capital was nearly 30 percent of assets in the 1970s and is less than 10 percent of assets \ntoday. A reduction of inventory levels, the result of more sophisticated technology and a shift toward intangible-\nbased businesses, is the biggest driver of this decline.96 \nExhibit 28 shows the annual change in net working capital from 1985 through 2021. At the end of 2021, the \nRussell 3000 companies in our sample had net working capital of $1.75 trillion. Net working capital investment \nover this time averaged just 0.2 percent of sales, a percentage substantially lower than that of M&A, investment \nSG&A ex-R&D, capital expenditures, and investment R&D. \n \n"

As a result, a deal is an admission of a past mistake.103 Second, most managers \nwant to grow their businesses rather than shrink them.

This stands to reason. Analysis shows \nthat it is common for a relatively small percentage of a company\u2019s assets to create most of the value.104 In other \nwords, most companies have businesses that fail to earn the cost of capital and therefore may be more valuable \nto another strategic or financial owner. These divestitures lead to addition by subtraction, as the value of the \nproceeds exceeds the value of the operation as part of the company.105   \nAs we saw, M&A creates value in the aggregate but the seller frequently captures more than 100 percent of that \nvalue. It is better, on average, to be a seller than a buyer. \nSellers do particularly well when an asset has multiple suitors. In a contested deal, the buyer is often subject to \nthe \u201cwinner\u2019s curse.\u201d106 In this case, the \u201cwinner\u201d of an auction offers too much for the asset and has to accept \nthe \u201ccurse\u201d of overpaying. The winner\u2019s curse describes a wealth transfer from the buyer to the seller. \nAcademic papers on M&A outnumber those about divestitures by nearly a six to one margin.107 A meta-analysis \nof nearly 100 studies on divestitures concludes: \u201cIn the broadest possible terms, our results suggest that on \naverage, divestiture actions are associated with positive performance outcomes for the parent firm.\u201d108 \nSpin-offs generally create value for the spin-offs themselves as well as the corporate parents.109 The central \nfinding of a recent meta-analysis of the spin-off literature was: \u201cspin-offs, conglomerates, and stockholders \nbenefit from tax-free divestiture and subsequent refocusing by the companies.\u201d110 The drivers of this value \ncreation include sharpened managerial focus, better information about the business, and tax treatment.111 \nDividends. The sum of cash a company can pay shareholders over its lifetime ultimately determines shareholder \nvalue. Dividends, share buybacks, and proceeds from the sale of the company for cash are the three main ways \nshareholders get cash. A dividend is a cash payment to a shareholder that is generally funded by profits.  \nDividends and buybacks are equivalent under strict assumptions (see appendix).112 But how executives think of \nthem is meaningfully different. Dividends, once set, are considered equivalent to investment decisions such as \ncapital expenditures. Buybacks are seen more as a way to disburse residual cash after the firm has made all \nsuitable investments.113 As a result, dividends are much less volatile than buybacks (see exhibit 33). The \nstandard deviation of the growth rate of dividends from 1985 to 2021 is around one-quarter that of buybacks.   \nExhibit 33: Dividends and Buybacks for the Russell 3000, 1985-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \n0\n2,000\n4,000\n6,000\n8,000\n10,000\n12,000\n14,000\n16,000\n18,000\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\n2019\n2021\nRussell 3000 Total Return Index\nAmount ($ Billions)\nRussell 3000 Index (right axis)\nDividends (left axis)\nBuybacks (left axis)\n"

For example, in his new \nedition of Stocks for the Long Run, Jeremy Siegel, a professor emeritus from the Wharton School at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, examines long-term results for the stock market and asserts that \u201cdividends are by \nfar the most important source of shareholder return.\u201d119 This is wrong if you seek to measure accumulated \ncapital. Price appreciation is the only source of investment return that increases accumulated capital over time.120 \nThe annual equity rate of return, stock price change plus dividend yield, is easy to calculate. But TSR is a multi-\nperiod measure that assumes all dividends are reinvested in the stock. If you know the price appreciation and \ndividend yield, you calculate TSR as follows: \nTotal shareholder return (TSR) = Price appreciation + [(1 + price appreciation) \u00d7 dividend yield] \nA one-year equity rate of return is always lower than the TSR if price appreciation is positive because of the \ncompounding of reinvested dividends. For example, assume price appreciation of 8 percent and a dividend yield \nof 3 percent. The equity rate of return is 11 percent (.08 + .03) but the TSR is 11.24 percent (.08 + [(1 + .08) \u00d7 \n.03]). \nFor an investor to earn the TSR, dividends must be reinvested back into the stock in full. There are two problems \nwith this. Investors generally do not reinvest their dividends back into the stock and TSR does not consider the \nrole of taxes.  \nSubstantial research in recent years shows that few institutional or individual investors reinvest their dividends \nin the stock of the payer.121 Investors do not think of price appreciation and dividends in the same way. Further, \nmany investors and market commentators fall for the \u201cfree dividends fallacy,\u201d which deems dividends to be a \nbuffer against price fluctuations without recognizing that dividends come at the expense of the price level.122  \nUsing different assumptions about reinvestment, some academics conclude that TSRs are understated while \nothers contend they are overstated.123 This underscores the importance of understanding how investors actually \nuse their dividends and makes clear that the presumption of full reinvestment is rarely correct. \nTaxes are an important part of the equation. Investors who own stocks in taxable accounts must pay taxes on \nthe dividends they receive. Exhibit 36 shows the maximum individual marginal tax rate for capital gains and \ndividends from 1954 to the present. Assuming that only the non-taxed portion of dividends are reinvested drops \nthe TSR. Academic research supports the view that the tax rate on payouts affects shareholder returns.124 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The percent of net income that companies are paying out in buybacks was meaningfully \nhigher in the last ten years of this period than it was in the first ten years. \nExhibit 37: Share Buybacks for the Russell 3000, 1985-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Vertical axis truncated for visualization. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1954\n1956\n1958\n1960\n1962\n1964\n1966\n1968\n1970\n1972\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\n2022\nTax Rate (Percent)\nDividends\nCapital Gains\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\n2019\n2021\nAs a percentage of net income\nAmount ($ Billions)\nAmount (left axis)\n% of net income (right axis)\n"

For example, in 1962 companies on the New York Stock Exchange bought back $1.1 billion of stock ($10.4 \nbillion in today\u2019s dollars) versus $37.3 billion ($368.2 billion) in capital expenditures.127 Discussions at that time \nfocused on buybacks as a proportion of trading volume. The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 prohibited \nthe manipulation of securities prices but what constituted manipulation was not always clear. Indeed, from time \nto time the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged companies with manipulating their stock \nthrough buyback programs.128 \nThat changed when the SEC adopted Rule 10b-18 in 1982. The rule grants companies a safe harbor provided \nthey follow certain guidelines for their buyback programs in terms of manner, timing, price, and volume. The \nSEC has updated the rules over the years to reflect market conditions. Five years prior to the enactment of Rule \n10b-18, the payout via buybacks was four percent of earnings. Five years after the rule, that payout ratio was \nmore than 30 percent.129  \nBased on surveys of the motivations to pursue buybacks, we place companies into the fair value, intrinsic value, \nand accounting-driven schools of thought.130 Companies can be motivated by more than one school at a time. \nThe intrinsic value school is best for continuing shareholders.  \nThe fair value school takes a steady and consistent approach to buybacks. Management believes that it will buy \nback shares when they are both overvalued and undervalued, but over time the average price will be fair. This \napproach offers shareholders substantial flexibility as it allows them to either hold shares and defer tax liabilities \nor create homemade dividends by selling a pro-rated number of shares. \nWhile buybacks have surpassed dividends in overall corporate payouts, the aggregate payout has been \nremarkably steady. Exhibit 38 shows the shareholder yield, defined as buybacks plus dividends divided by the \nequity capital of the market, as well as an estimate of the cost of equity, from 1985 to 2021. We show the \nshareholder yield gross and net of equity issuance.  \nExhibit 38: Shareholder Yield and the Cost of Equity for the Russell 3000, 1985-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet, Aswath Damodaran, and Counterpoint Global. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\n2019\n2021\nPercent\nCost of equity\nTotal Shareholder Yield (Gross)\nTotal Shareholder Yield (Net)\n"

Total \nshareholder yield is among the key drivers of long-run stock market returns and provides more predictability \nthan dividend yield alone.131 \nThis school also supports the free cash flow hypothesis, which says that managers who have excess cash will \nbe tempted to invest in projects that have a negative net present value. Disbursing cash, whether through a \nbuyback or a dividend, lessens the risk that management will deploy the funds foolishly.132 The research also \nshows that many firms would do well by buying back stock consistently.133 \nThe intrinsic value school is based on the idea of market timing. Specifically, a firm should only buy back shares \nwhen they appear undervalued. To do this profitably, a company\u2019s management must have information that the \nstock price fails to reflect.  \nThe challenge is that CFOs, who often have a large say in matters of financial policy, are badly miscalibrated. \nFor example, 50-80 percent of them say the stock of their company is undervalued when surveyed in a typical \nquarter.134 The most common method that CFOs cite for valuing the stock of their company is \u201ccurrent price \nrelative to historic highs and lows.\u201d135 This does not instill confidence. \nFirms in the intrinsic value school adhere to the golden rule of share buybacks: \u201cA company should repurchase \nits shares only when its stock is trading below its expected value and when no better investment opportunities \nare available.\u201d136 \nThe golden rule sets an absolute benchmark while recognizing relative value. Buying stock below its intrinsic \nvalue is a surefire way to increase value per share. But companies should prioritize internal investment \nopportunities if they have higher returns than buybacks.  \nCFOs should ideally rank the expected value of various investment opportunities and fund them from highest to \nlowest. In reality, CFOs list \u201chaving extra cash/liquid assets\u201d as the most important factor determining their \ndecision to buy back stock.137  \nTo be clear, buying back undervalued or overvalued stock does not create or destroy value for the company. It \ntransfers wealth from one group of shareholders to another. A company that buys back undervalued stock \ntransfers wealth from the sellers to the ongoing holders. A company that buys back overvalued stock transfers \nvalue from the ongoing holders to the sellers.   \nExhibit 39 presents a simple example. The firm value is $100,000 and there are 1,000 shares outstanding, which \nmeans that the intrinsic value per share is $100 ($100,000/1,000). The company decides to return $20,000 to \nshareholders. We show three scenarios. We can see what happens if the stock price deviates meaningfully from \nintrinsic value or if the company pays a dividend.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

There is no \nvalue created or lost. Before the payout the firm is worth $100,000, and after the payout the firm is worth $80,000 \nand shareholders have $20,000 in their pocket. We want to understand the wealth transfers.   \nLet\u2019s start with the assumption that the stock price is $200, double the fair value. In scenario A, the company \nbuys 100 shares ($20,000/$200), which leaves $80,000 of corporate value and 900 shares outstanding. The \nselling shareholders gain $100 per share ($200 proceeds - $100 value = $100) and the continuing shareholders \nlose $11.11 per share ($88.89 continuing value - $100 initial value = -$11.11). Buying back overvalued stock \nbenefits sellers at the expense of ongoing holders. \nNow we look at what happens if the stock trades at $50 per share, one-half of its fair value. The company can \nbuy 400 shares in scenario B. This leaves $80,000 of value and 600 shares outstanding. The selling \nshareholders lose $50 per share ($50 proceeds - $100 value = -$50) and continuing shareholders gain $33.33 \nper share ($133.33 continuing value - $100 initial value = $33.33).

All rights reserved. \n6186732 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n39\n \nTo complete the analysis, scenario C considers the case when the company pays a $20 dividend to all \nshareholders. The stock price does not matter. The firm value drops to $80,000, each shareholder receives $20 \nper share ($20,000/1,000), and only tax considerations will determine how much each shareholder can keep. \nSome other features of this analysis are worth pointing out. First, if you own shares of a company buying back \nstock, inaction is equivalent to increasing your percentage ownership in the company. If you do not want your \npercentage stake to rise, you can sell shares in proportion to your ownership position. This effectively creates a \ndividend while maintaining the same percentage ownership in the business. \nSome investors, curiously, claim they prefer that the companies they hold in their portfolio pay a dividend rather \nthan buy back stock. Perhaps the focus is on the signal a dividend conveys. But if you own shares of a company \nbecause you correctly think it is undervalued, buybacks will by definition increase value per share.   \nWhile it would be reasonable to doubt management\u2019s ability to time the market, the empirical research converges \non some conclusions. First, on average companies can time the sale and purchase of equity so as to benefit \nongoing shareholders.138 But the wealth transfers are generally larger for sales of overpriced equity than they \nare for purchases of undervalued equity.139 Finally, institutional investors are usually more adept than individual \ninvestors at transacting with companies.140  \nBuybacks and equity issuance tend to be useful signals to investors, and 85 percent of financial executives \nagree or strongly agree that \u201crepurchase decisions convey information about our company to investors.\u201d141 A \nfew factors determine the strength of the signal.  \nCompleting programs that are announced is a good start. The method of buybacks also signals conviction. \nOpen-market purchases, the most commonly used by far, signal the weakest conviction. Dutch auctions and \ntender offers are now rare but suggest a strong positive signal, especially when the buyback is funded with \ndebt.142 Finally, large programs convey more information than small ones do and the credibility of the signal rises \nif there is high insider ownership and executives indicate that they do not intend to sell any shares.143  \nThe principal-agent problem and its associated agency costs show up in the discussion of buybacks. Buybacks \nhave the potential to either solve or create agency costs.144 They solve agency costs by returning capital to \nshareholders, thus limiting the potential for value-destroying investments. They create agency costs when \nbuybacks are used as a means to enrich executives or simply to make them look good.   \nThe accounting-driven school uses buybacks to improve accounting outcomes, including increasing earnings \nper share or reducing dilution associated with stock-based compensation (SBC). For example, in one survey, \n76 percent of CFOs said that increasing EPS was an important, or very important, factor in the decision to buy \nback stock. And 68 percent indicated that offsetting dilution from SBC was important or very important.145 \nResearch suggests that more than one-third of buybacks in recent years have gone to counter the increase in \nshares as the result of SBC.146  \nAs we saw with M&A, there is no evidence that increasing EPS increases shareholder value with buybacks.147 \nValue creation and changes in EPS are separate concepts, and EPS increases should not be used as a proxy \nfor value creation. Indeed, the presumption that buybacks always increase EPS is wrong. A buyback\u2019s impact \non EPS is a function of the price-earnings multiple and the foregone after-tax interest income or after-tax cost of \ndebt used to fund the program.148  \n"

There is plenty of evidence that companies buy back \nstock to manage earnings or to reach a financial objective that prompts a bonus.149 These goals are inconsistent \nwith the idea that management should allocate capital so as to create value for shareholders. \nKnowing about management\u2019s thought process and incentives can be helpful in assessing the value-creating \npotential of buybacks.

All rights reserved. \n6186732 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n41\n \nAssessing Management\u2019s Capital Allocation Skills \nIn an ideal world, corporate executives would allocate capital to maximize long-term value per share. But, for \nreasons that are mostly understandable, there\u2019s a lot of evidence that they fall short of this objective.151  \nIn his 2022 presidential address to the American Finance Association, John Graham, a professor of finance at \nDuke University, provides an excellent summary of how financial executives actually make decisions based on \ntheir survey responses over decades:152 \n\u2022 \nCFOs adopt conservative policies. For example, the average hurdle rate for a project is 600 basis points \nin excess of the cost of capital in order to accommodate the potential miscalculation of prospective cash \nflows. Further, dividends are set using a payout ratio that allows for earnings declines while preserving \nthe commitment. Capital structures are also targeted to be below the optimal level of debt so as to build \nin resilience. \n\u2022 \nThe forecasts of managers suffer from overprecision, a form of overconfidence.153 While the forecast \naverages tend to be fine, the assessment of the projected range of outcomes is vastly narrower than \nwhat actually occurs. Conservative policies are in part an attempt to counterbalance this overprecision.    \n\u2022 \nDecision making is sticky. We saw this in the introduction with how capital is allocated to divisions in a \nvery consistent fashion from year to year. CFOs tend to maintain their estimates of the cost of capital \nand the blend of debt and equity financing even in the face of large changes in interest rates. \n\u2022 \nCompanies generally employ simple decision rules. For example, CFOs rely more on the current price \nrelative to historic highs and lows than on an internal valuation. Further, the capital-asset pricing model \n(CAPM) is by far the most common way to estimate the cost of equity capital despite the model\u2019s \nempirical limitations.  \n\u2022 \nPaying dividends, once initiated, is as important as funding investment. More than 60 percent of CFOs \nsaid they would not cut dividends to fund a value-creating investment alternative. Those who indicated \nthey would consider reducing the dividend to invest in the business suggested they would need to earn \nan ROIC of at least 19 percent, more than double the cost of capital for most companies.   \n\u2022 \nIn recent decades there has been a shift away from shareholder primacy toward stakeholders. Firms \nthat score high in stakeholder orientation rank employees and customers ahead of shareholders. \nWith these findings in mind, we outline a framework for assessing the quality of a management team\u2019s capital \nallocation skills. We do this in four parts. We start with past capital allocation actions. As Warren Buffett notes, \n\u201cAfter ten years on the job, a CEO whose company annually retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth will have \nbeen responsible for the deployment of more than 60% of all the capital at work in the business.\u201d154  \nNext, we suggest studying a company\u2019s ROIC and return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC). A careful \nstudy of a company\u2019s corporate governance and incentives is the third part. Finally, we examine how a \nmanagement\u2019s past decisions stack up against five principles of capital allocation. \nPast Spending Patterns. We begin our assessment by looking at how management has spent money in the \npast. We examine investment (M&A, investment SG&A ex-R&D, capital expenditures, investment R&D, and \nworking capital) and payout policy (dividends, buybacks, and debt prepayment) separately. \n"

In a traditional calculation, NOPAT is driven by sales and \nsales growth, operating profit margins, and the cash tax rate.  \nInvestment is driven by changes in working capital, capital expenditures net of depreciation, and acquisitions \nnet of divestitures. Note that investment SG&A ex-R&D and investment R&D are not capitalized in the traditional \ncalculation. We modify the figures to do so. But free cash flow is the same with or without the adjustments.   \nAlfred Rappaport calls these terms \u201cvalue drivers\u201d because they determine the free cash flows that drive value \nin a discounted cash flow model.155 Rappaport defines the investment value drivers as the percent the company \ninvests in each use for every $1.00 change in sales. This allows for us to compare the measures.  \nFor instance, if a firm\u2019s net working capital grows by $200 in a given year and its sales grow by $1,000, the \nincremental working capital rate is 20 percent ($200/$1,000). If capital expenditures are $500 and depreciation \nis $200, the incremental fixed capital rate is 30 percent ([$500 - $200]/$1,000). We can calculate the value driver \nfor incremental M&A less divestitures, or any other investment, in the same way. \nThis allows us to study how a company actually invested in the past. The further we can go back the better, and \nit is useful to note which executives were in charge of the capital allocation decisions. Here are the numbers for \nMicrosoft, a multinational technology company, for the five years ended in fiscal 2022:156 \nIncremental M&A rate: \n  33.9 percent \nIncremental internally-generated intangible rate:    32.2 percent \nIncremental fixed capital rate:  \n  47.4 percent \nIncremental working capital rate:  \n   -8.6 percent \nThese figures let us see instantly where the company has invested. In this case, net working capital was a source \nof cash, capital expenditures were the largest use of cash, and M&A and internally-generated intangibles were \nnot too far behind.  \nHere are the numbers for Cisco Systems, a digital communications company, over the past five years ended in \nfiscal 2022: \nIncremental M&A rate: \n144.2 percent \nIncremental internally-generated intangible rate:    21.7 percent \nIncremental fixed capital rate:  \n -44.8 percent \nIncremental working capital rate: \n -16.0 percent \nNet working capital was also a source of cash for Cisco. But here we see the vast majority of the company\u2019s net \ninvestment is going to M&A, investment in internally-generated intangibles are positive, and that the company\u2019s \ncapital expenditures are below the maintenance level. A business analyst would logically seek to understand \nhow management makes its M&A decisions. A review of the results from past deals would also be appropriate. \nAn examination of past capital allocation decisions also allows us to find inflection points. For instance, \nMicrosoft\u2019s fixed capital rate has risen in recent years to support the growth of Azure, its cloud computing \nplatform. Mondelez International, a multinational food and beverage company, freed $4.5 billion in net working \ncapital by taking its cash conversion cycle from 39 days in 2013 to -37 days in 2021. Changes such as these \nshould be integrated into a strategic analysis to assess a company\u2019s future investments and profits.  \n"

We have established that dividends, once paid, are sticky and considered to be \nas important to maintain as investments in the business. Share buybacks are more volatile, and we want to \nunderstand the motivation behind them. \nLet\u2019s return to our examples. For the five years ended fiscal 2022, Microsoft\u2019s total shareholder yield was 3.0 \npercent. The company returned $183 billion to shareholders, 42 percent in dividends and 58 percent in net share \nbuybacks. The difference between the highest and lowest amount of dividends paid in those years was $5.4 \nbillion, whereas the same difference for net buybacks was $21.1 billion. \nCisco\u2019s total shareholder yield was 8.0 percent for the five years ended fiscal 2022, although it dropped from \ndouble-digits in the early years to mid-single-digits in more recent years. The company returned $81 billion to \nshareholders, with 38 percent coming in the form of dividends and 62 percent in net share buybacks. The range \nfrom the highest to lowest dividends paid over those years was only $0.3 billion, while the dispersion for net \nbuybacks was $18.7 billion. \nWe need to evaluate investment and payout in the context of a company\u2019s capital structure. Most companies \nmaintain their target ratios of debt and equity, even when conditions suggest that a revision makes sense. \nUnderstanding the rationale and motivation for these decisions is vital. We also want to see if management\u2019s \ndecision-making process is consistent with creating long-term value per share. \nAt the end of the day, executives are humans who are not always disciplined and rational. As a case in point, \nwhile most large companies say they always or almost always use the net present value rule to evaluate projects \nor acquisitions, the reputation of the division manager requesting resources is also important, as is senior \nmanagement\u2019s \u201cgut feel.\u201d157 \nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Return on Incremental Invested Capital (ROIIC). Management\u2019s \ngoal should be to create value by making investments that earn a return in excess of the opportunity cost of \ncapital. ROIC is one way to measure whether a company has achieved this goal. \nOur recent reports, \u201cReturn on Invested Capital: How to Calculate ROIC and Handle Common Issues\u201d and \u201cROIC \nand Intangible Assets: A Look at How Adjustments for Intangibles Affect ROIC,\u201d provide a detailed explanation \nof how to calculate ROIC.158 Included is a discussion of how to handle internally-generated intangible \ninvestments, which are reflected on the balance sheet as assets and then amortized on the income statement.  \nThe numerator of ROIC is NOPAT, the same figure we saw in the calculation of free cash flow. NOPAT is the \ncash earnings of a business excluding the impact of interest expense from debt or interest income from excess \ncash. As a result, it remains the same no matter what mix of debt and equity a company selects to fund the firm. \nInvested capital is the net assets a company needs to generate NOPAT or, equivalently, the combination of debt \nand equity a company uses to finance those assets. The investment in each year determines the change in \ninvested capital. In this way, we can see the links between free cash flow and ROIC. Investment is subtracted \nfrom NOPAT to determine free cash flow. NOPAT is the numerator of ROIC. And invested capital is accumulated \ninvestment. \nAn ROIC above the cost of capital indicates that a company is creating value. For example, say a company has \nNOPAT of $150, invested capital of $1,000, and a cost of capital of 7 percent. That company\u2019s ROIC of 15 \npercent ($150/$1,000) would be well in excess of the 7 percent cost of capital. A business with the same invested \ncapital earning $50 would have an ROIC of 5 percent ($50/$1,000), below the cost of capital.  \n"

The data excludes companies in the financial and real estate sectors and covers \nthe period from 1990 through 2021. The ROICs exceeded the cost of capital, set at a threshold of 5 percent, in \nabout 70 percent of the observations both for the traditional and adjusted calculations. \nThe market looks forward and sunk costs do not determine future value. Accordingly, we want to understand \nchange on the margin. Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) allows us to do this. ROIIC measures the \nchange in NOPAT relative to the change in invested capital. While the calculation ignores sunk costs, it makes \nthe strong assumption the return on the existing invested capital is unchanged. This is often unrealistic. \nHere is the calculation for ROIIC:    \nReturn on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) = \n Year1 NOPAT \u2013 Year0 NOPAT\nYear0 invested capital \u2013 Year-1 invested capital \nROIIC seeks to quantify how the investments made in one year affect the NOPAT in the following year.  \nOne of the limitations of ROIC and ROIIC is that the results can be very noisy. This is especially true for \ncompanies that make large investments sporadically in contrast to firms that invest steadily over time. This is \nwhy ROIC is typically a poor way to assess M&A. Once the deal is done, the denominator, invested capital, goes \nup right away while the numerator, NOPAT, reflects the deal\u2019s cash flows only over time.  \nTake Microsoft\u2019s announcement in early 2022 that it had agreed to acquire Activision Blizzard, a video game \ncompany, for $69 billion. If the deal closes, Microsoft\u2019s traditional invested capital will increase around 40 \npercent, and its invested capital adjusted for internally-generated intangible assets will swell by more than 25 \npercent.   \nThe way to moderate ROIIC is to calculate it over periods of three or five years. For example, the three-year \nrolling ROIIC takes the change in NOPAT over the last three years (Year3 NOPAT \u2013 Year0 NOPAT) and divides \nit by the lagged change in invested capital (Year2 invested capital \u2013 Year-1 invested capital).

Operating leverage is measured as change in NOPAT divided by change \nin sales and indicates how well a business is absorbing its fixed costs. Operating leverage can be positive or \nnegative and is usually transitory. That said, managers and investors recognize operating leverage with a lag, \nwhich can provide opportunity. \nCorporate Governance and Incentives. Executives are ultimately responsible for capital allocation. As a result, \nit is important to assess their motivations and incentives. The ideal is a company that has senior leadership, \nincluding the CEO and CFO, who have a \u201cNorth Star of value.\u201d The North Star provides a dependable sense of \ndirection because it is readily visible in the sky when it is dark and is stable throughout the night and year.  \nExecutives without a North Star can be swayed by the differing and sometimes conflicting points of view that \nthey hear from shareholders, stakeholders, investment bankers, and the media. Executives grounded by the \ndiscipline of building long-term value per share maintain a steady course and use the asymmetric information \nthey have about the business to the advantage of ongoing shareholders. \nAn understanding of a company\u2019s governing objective, a clear statement of what a company is fundamentally \ntrying to achieve, is essential. The objective guides a firm\u2019s culture, communications, compensation, and capital \nallocation. It should also provide insight into a company\u2019s time horizon. Corporate governance is a system of \nchecks and balances to make sure that executives faithfully serve the company\u2019s governing objective.159 \nThe governing objective commonly focuses on shareholders or stakeholders. In recent years companies have \nshifted their orientation toward stakeholders. We believe this is a false choice. Companies that seek to build \nlong-term shareholder value need to take care of all of their stakeholders, including employees, customers, and \nsuppliers. Creating long-term value is also consistent with minimizing negative externalities and working with \nlawmakers and regulators.  \nThe governing objective is important because it guides decisions about the inevitable trade-offs that executives \nface. A clear objective also provides stakeholders with the basis to opt in or opt out of involvement with the \ncompany and allows outsiders to evaluate the choices that managers make.  \nInvestors keen to find companies intent on building long-term value need to consider agency costs160 Scholars \npoint out three areas where these costs create conflict between the interests of managers and shareholders.161 \nThe first is what maximizes value for management may be different from what maximizes value for shareholders. \nIn general, executives earn more when they control more resources. Therefore, they may have an incentive to \ndo M&A deals even if they destroy value or avoid divestitures even if they create value.  \nRisk tolerance is another source of potential conflict. Most investors hold shares of a company as part of a \ndiversified portfolio, commonly by way of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund. The wealth of most executives \nis largely invested in the shares of their company. As a consequence, executives may seek less risk than what \nthe shareholders would deem appropriate. That CFOs pursue conservative policies supports this view.  \nThe final area of conflict deals with time horizon. Mismatches arise when the time horizon of compensation plans \nare shorter than the time horizon investors use to assess the attractiveness of an investment. For instance, \nnearly 80 percent of financial executives said they would be willing to pass on a value-creating investment in \norder to make near-term earnings.162 \nExecutive compensation is one way to align the interests of managers and shareholders. But creating a scheme \nthat provides managers with the proper incentives to create long-term value is difficult. We can start by examining \nthe extremes.  \n"

More than 60 percent of CEO pay for the top 100 public companies in the U.S. is in \nthe form of stock options or stock awards and long-term incentive plans. This form of pay is more than one-half \nof total compensation for the top 3,000 public companies in the U.S.163 \nThe other extreme is when the CEO owns all of the non-public shares. This should allay concerns about agency \ncosts. But note the distinction between control of voting rights and economic ownership. Research shows that \ncompanies with dual-class stock, where one class of stock has more votes per share than the other, can give \nrise to agency costs.164 Founders generally own the class of shares that allow for multiple votes, effectively \nestablishing control over the company.  \nThe rate of growth in CEO pay in the U.S. has been well in excess of that for rank-and-file employees and of \noverall economic growth. Compensation for CEOs over the past 40 years has shifted from mostly salary and \nbonus to mostly stock. CEO wealth is increasingly sensitive to changes in the stock price.165 Today, a 1 percent \nchange in stock price leads to about a 1.5 percent change in wealth for the average CEO of a top 100 public \ncompany in the U.S.166 The shift toward stock-based compensation may appear to reduce agency costs but it \ncan introduce other challenges.  \nThe first issue is that the form of employee pay can itself affect capital allocation. This shows up most directly in \nshare buybacks.167 To put this in context, companies in the Russell 3000 reported expense for SBC of $225 \nbillion and gross share buybacks of $1.0 trillion in 2021. As noted earlier, more than three-quarters of CFOs said \nthat offsetting dilution from SBC was an important or very important reason to buy back stock.  \nExhibit 42 shows SBC as a percentage of sales for companies in the Russell 3000, ranked by size. SBC as a \npercentage of sales tends to decline as companies get bigger. SBC is roughly 9 percent of sales, on average, \nfor companies with sales of $100 to $250 million but only about 1 percent for companies with sales in excess of \n$20 billion. Buybacks are concentrated among the bigger companies.  \nExhibit 42: Stock-Based Compensation as a Percentage of Sales by Size, Russell 3000, 2021 \n \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Russell 3000 as of 12/31/21; Data for calendar year 2021; Companies with minimum sales of $100 million. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n100-250M\n250-500M\n500-800M 800-1,250M 1.25-2.0B\n2.0-3.5B\n3.5-8.0B\n8-20B\n>20B\nStock-Based Compensation \nas a Percentage of Sales\nSales, Calendar Year 2021 ($)\n25th Percentile\nMean\n75th Percentile\n"

The median SBC issuance for healthcare and \ninformation technology, for instance, is vastly higher than that for materials or consumer staples (see exhibit 43). \nManagement should evaluate the virtue of a stock buyback program independent of its compensation policy. \nBut companies link the two in reality. \nExhibit 43: Stock-Based Compensation as a Percentage of Sales, Russell 3000 Sectors, 2021 \nSector \nMedian \nAggregate \nHealthcare \n13.4% \n1.3% \nInformation Technology \n6.0% \n4.2% \nTelecommunication Services \n2.1% \n0.9% \nFinancials \n1.4% \n1.9% \nEnergy \n1.0% \n0.8% \nIndustrials \n0.9% \n1.1% \nConsumer Discretionary \n0.7% \n1.0% \nMaterials \n0.6% \n0.5% \nConsumer Staples \n0.6% \n0.4% \nUtilities \n0.6% \n0.7% \nTotal \n1.5% \n1.6% \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Russell 3000 as of 12/31/21; Data for calendar year 2021; Companies with minimum sales of $10 million. \nWhether SBC is doing a good job of focusing management on long-term performance is a topic of spirited \ndebate.168 Competing theories for the drivers of CEO pay, including shareholder value maximization, rent \nextraction, and other institutional factors, all have some support in the research.169 But SBC is effectively limited \nby a number of considerations.  \nTo begin, a company\u2019s stock price is only a crude measure of corporate performance. Other drivers of price, \nincluding general economic conditions, changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, and the equity risk \npremium, can be more important than corporate results. These external factors are mostly out of the control of \nmanagement.170 \nFurther, the information the stock market provides to managers regarding investment opportunities, current \ncapital allocation decisions, and past capital allocation decisions can be very noisy in the short run.171 We saw \nthat with the initial reactions to M&A deals. They were on average correct directionally and relatively unbiased \nbut also wrong from time to time. This problem is compounded by the reality that few executives understand the \nexpectations for future financial results that the stock market reflects.172 \nWe will return to these considerations in a moment. But before we do, we can look at the most common \nperformance-based long-term incentive metrics that companies use. Exhibit 44 shows the results of an annual \nsurvey of the largest 250 companies in the S&P 500 by FW Cook, a consulting firm dedicated to executive \ncompensation.

However, some caution is in order. As we discussed earlier, TSR \ncan be a misleading measure of actual shareholder return. That can create a gap between what triggers \nexecutive pay and the returns that shareholders earn. \nTSR is relevant only if management knows how to create value. Throughout our discussion we have seen many \ninstances where the decisions of management are inconsistent with building long-term value.    \nFinally, external factors may be more important than company-specific drivers in determining the TSR. TSR fails \nin cases when it is used as a measure that is absolute, versus relative to an appropriate benchmark, because it \ndoes not isolate the results of the firm. \nCompanies with a proper North Star seek to create long-term value per share with the belief that stock price \nultimately follows value. In the case that the price does not properly reflect the value, management can refine \nits communication with the financial community or take action by buying or selling stock. There is also good \nevidence that companies that are clear on their mission to create long-term value and spread that message \neffectively attract quality shareholders. In these cases, shareholders resemble business partners as their goals \nand expectations are aligned with those of management.173   \nIncentive compensation is part of the corporate governance structure that supports a governing objective. If the \ngoverning objective focuses on creating long-term value per share, compensation will have a handful of features \nthat support judicious capital allocation.174 \nBoards should design compensation for senior executives so that stock options or restricted stock units are \nindexed to the overall market or a proper set of peers. Indexing helps to reduce the role of luck and isolates the \ncontribution of skill if external factors have a similar impact on the peers as they do on the focal firm. An \nemployee\u2019s incentive compensation should relate to what he or she can control. This reduces the number of \nemployees eligible for stock-based compensation to those who can influence the stock price. \nMost employees have little individual sway over the stock price. Accordingly, compensation for executives and \nfront-line employees involved with an operating unit should be based on long-term goals for the unit\u2019s operating \nvalue drivers, including sales growth, operating profit margins, and some measure of return on invested capital.  \nValue drivers that are too coarse can be refined into \u201cleading indicators of value,\u201d measures that roll up to the \nvalue drivers. For instance, leading indicators of value for a retailer seeking to open ten stores in a year might \ninclude identifying store locations and signing leases. The incentives align with what the employees can control.  \n"

James McTaggart, Peter Kontes, and Michael Mankins, management \nconsultants, describe four principles of resource allocation in their book, The Value Imperative.180 We believe \nthat these principles are useful for thinking about capital allocation. We add a fifth principle that emphasizes \naction. These principles can provide a framework to measure management\u2019s mindset with regard to capital \nallocation. They are also consistent with what Will Thorndike called \u201cThe Outsider's Checklist\u201d in his excellent \nbook, The Outsiders.181  \n1. Zero-based capital allocation. Two empirical observations from the prior discussion are relevant here. \nFirst, the vast majority of companies are below the threshold of optimal capital allocation among divisions, \nwhich means that some divisions get too much investment and others too little (see exhibit 1). Second, \nCFOs are by nature conservative. This aversion to change can put companies out of step in a dynamic \nworld. \nThe zero-based approach asks the question, \u201cWhat is the right amount of capital (and the right number of \npeople) to have in this business in order to support the strategy that will create the most wealth?\u201d182 The \nanswer is based on the future and does not rule out reducing net investment when appropriate. \nThe research shows that companies that are more proactive in their internal resource allocation generate \na higher ROA than those that are more conservative.183 There is also evidence that companies that are \ngood at internal capital allocation are also effective at external allocation.184 \n2. Fund strategies, not projects. Capital allocation should support a company\u2019s strategic goals. But that\u2019s \nnot what usually happens. Small investment decisions are usually made within a business unit, medium \ndecisions go to unit managers, and large decisions go to the CEO or board of directors. These are \nprocesses to control how money is spent but can fail to put decisions into a broader context. \nCapital allocation should start with an assessment and approval of strategies and then determine which \nprojects support the strategies. This distinction is commonly overlooked. There can be projects that pass \na rate-of-return test within a strategy that fails. There can also be projects that fail the rate-of-return test \nthat support a winning strategy. \nFor example, you might imagine a company that identifies an automation project within a fulfillment center \nthat has a high rate of return and hence gets approved for investment. At the same time, the company \nrealizes that the industry has excess capacity and that some fulfillment centers need to be closed to \nsupport the company\u2019s strategy. That is a good project within a bad strategy. \nWarren Buffett\u2019s concept of the institutional imperative is also relevant in this discussion. Often, CEOs \nmake investment decisions first and only then make sure they have figures to support the choice. In most \ncases, a member of the finance team will create a spreadsheet that justifies the investment. As Buffett \nsays, \u201cAny business craving of the leader, however foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-\nreturn and strategic studies prepared by his troops.\u201d185  \nA successful business strategy is supported by a bundle of projects, including some that may not look \nattractive on their own. What matters is the value of the bundle.  \n3. No capital rationing, but earn sufficient returns on the capital you use. Within most mature \ncompanies the practical attitude is that capital is \u201cscarce but free.\u201d Scarce because the amount of capital \navailable to reinvest in the business is perceived to be constrained by the cash flow the business \ngenerates and the company\u2019s payout commitments. Free because business leaders sometimes fail to \n"

This is consistent with \nthe conservatism and sticky decision-making processes that CFOs exhibit.  \nA more suitable mindset is that capital is accessible but comes at a cost. Capital can come from a couple \nof sources beyond cash flow from operations. One is the redeploying of capital from divisions that do not \nearn sufficient returns, either by reducing the invested capital or selling the business outright, to divisions \nwith strong prospects for value creation. Capital markets are also a source of capital, although the \nwillingness to supply capital tends to be cyclical.  \nCounter to what theory says, many executives act as if the cash that the business generates is essentially \nfree. The right mindset is that all capital, whether from an internal or external source, has an opportunity \ncost. This can present a problem when firms make decisions that add to earnings or earnings per share \nwithout properly reckoning for value.  \nStock-based compensation is also relevant in this context. That SBC, a legitimate expense, is added back \nto cash flow from operations provides the illusion that the business is generating more cash than it is. SBC \nis essentially a financing activity, as the company issues equity to pay employees. SBC can be an effective \nway to recruit employees, address liquidity issues, and reduce agency costs. But it is a cost that needs to \nbe considered properly.   \nIn recent years, the cost of capital has been low by historical standards and access to capital has been \nrelatively easy, whether in the form of initial public offerings, secondary offerings, or venture capital \nfunding. This created excesses that have been mostly wrung out. The problem was not that companies \nwere investing insufficient sums because of perceived constraints, but rather that they invested without \nthe prospect of earning the appropriate return on investment that prudence dictates.     \n4. Zero tolerance for bad growth. An investment, whether made by a business or a money manager, will \nsucceed only with some probability. Companies that aspire to grow will sometimes allocate capital to \ninvestments that do not pay off. New businesses and products fail at a high rate. For example, Amazon, \na multinational technology company known for its e-commerce and cloud computing operations, has a \nlong list of failed initiatives.186 The point is that companies should not remain wedded to a strategy or \nbusiness initiative that has no prospects to create value. Doing so drains human and financial resources. \nFirms should invest in innovation while cutting losses when a strategy is unlikely to pay off. This is an \nexplicit recognition of the value of quitting.187 Further, as we have seen, divesting businesses can be \ndesirable because the value to the buyer is higher than the value to the seller. Exiting businesses also \nreduces the risk of cross-subsidization within a firm and allows for the best and brightest employees to \nmanage the businesses that create the most value. \n5. Know the value of assets and be ready to take action to create value. Great capital allocators always \nhave a sense of the difference between price and value in all of their businesses. And, as important, they \nare willing to act to build value when those gaps become large enough to overcome frictions such as taxes \nand fees. \nAs we mentioned at the outset, the answer to most capital allocation questions is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d An \ninformed view of value and price allows management to do the right thing at the right time. In some cases \nthat means buying, in others selling, and in most cases doing nothing at all. Executives usually prefer to \nbuy rather than sell, even though buyers generally do worse than sellers. The message is to overcome \ninertia in order to take steps to build long-term value for all stakeholders. \n"

But \nnot all senior executives know how to allocate capital effectively. Agency costs are one major challenge to good \ncapital allocation. Executives, who largely control corporate resources, can make decisions that benefit them \nrather than doing what is in the interests of shareholders. In fact, incentive programs that are based on \naccounting results or are unrelated to value creation can promote decisions that are not in the best interests of \nlong-term shareholders. We believe the appropriate objective of capital allocation is to add long-term value per \nshare.  \nWe started by looking at the sources of capital and observed that U.S. corporations fund most of their \ninvestments internally. We then looked at the uses of capital and saw that mergers and acquisitions (M&A), \ninvestment SG&A ex-R&D, and capital expenditures receive the largest allocations. We reviewed eight capital \nallocation alternatives (M&A, investment SG&A ex-R&D, capital expenditures, investment R&D, working capital \nchange, divestitures, dividends, and share buybacks), noting the past spending and drawing on academic \nresearch to understand the prospects for value creation. We believe that the discussion of intangible investment \nis novel in the context of capital allocation. \nWe finished with a framework to assess management\u2019s capital allocation practices. This includes looking at past \nbehavior, calculating return on invested capital and return on incremental cost of capital, an evaluation of \nincentives and what behaviors they may encourage, and five principles of good capital allocation that can be \nused as a benchmark.  \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 83-85 \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6186732 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n54\n \nAppendix: The Equivalence of Dividends and Share Buybacks \nWe can show that under theoretical conditions dividends and buybacks are equivalent ways to return cash to \nshareholders. These conditions include no or equivalent taxes, proceeds from dividends and buybacks are \ninvested at the same rate, dividends and buybacks occur at the same time, and the stock trades at fair value \nwhen the buyback occurs.  \nWe start by specifying a stream of cash flows that will be returned to shareholders. We assume that a $100 \npayment in the first year grows at a nine percent rate in years two through five, followed by a lump sum in year \nsix. The payments are made at the end of the year. We assign a cost of equity of 7 percent and start with 100 \nshares outstanding.  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nCash flows \n$100.0 \n$109.0 \n$118.8 \n$129.5 \n$141.2 \n$772.7 \nThe sum of the present value of this series of cash flows is $1,000, determined as follows: \nPresent value before payout \nPresent value of cash flow \n$93.5 \n$95.2 \n$97.0 \n$98.8 \n$100.6 \n$514.9 \nTotal value \n$1,000.0 \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the beginning of the year when the payouts begin, the value of the first year\u2019s payout is $93.5, or $100/(1 + \n.07)1, the value for the year 2 payout is $95.2, or $109/(1 + .07)2, and so forth. The value per share is therefore \n$10 ($1,000/100).  \nTo show the equivalence, we need to move forward in time. At the end of year 1, for example, the company will \npay out $100 and there will be only 5 payments left. At the end of year 2, the company will pay out $109, and \nthere will be only 4 payments left, etc. \nWe assume that the proceeds from either the dividend or the buyback are reinvested at the cost of equity. We \nknow that the total value of these payments plus the reinvested amount will be $1,500.7, which is $1,000 \u2715 (1 \n+ .07)6. This calculation is compounding, or the unwinding of discounting. We will end up with that amount \nwhether we assume a dividend or a buyback. Because we assumed reinvestment at the cost of equity, the \ninternal rate of return (IRR) is also 7 percent. The total value would be different, but still equivalent, if we were \nto assume an alternative reinvestment rate. \nLet\u2019s start with dividends, as that\u2019s the easier case. At the end of year 1, we assume the company pays a $100 \ndividend. At the end of year 2, the company pays $109, and so on.  \nNote that there is an additional source of value from reinvesting the proceeds of the dividend at the cost of \nequity. That reinvestment is worth $7.0 in year 2 ($100 \u2715 .07) so the total value at the end of year 2 is $216 \n(dividend payments of $100 and $109 plus reinvested dividends of $7).     \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nDividend payment \n$100.0  \n$109.0  \n$118.8  \n$129.5  \n$141.2  \n$772.7  \nReinvestment \n0.0  \n7.0  \n15.1  \n24.5  \n35.3  \n47.6  \nTotal value \n$100.0  \n$216.0  \n$349.9  \n$503.9  \n$680.4  $1,500.7  \nWe proceed in the same fashion for each of the 6 years until all of the cash flows have been paid out. We end \nup with $1,371.2 from the dividends and $129.5 from the reinvested proceeds for a total of $1,500.7.     \n"

At the end of year 1, we assume the company buys back $100 worth of stock. The \nvalue of the firm immediately preceding the buyback is $1,070 ($1,000 \u2715 (1 + .07)), which means the stock \ntrades at $10.70. The company can repurchase 9.3 shares.  \nAt the end of year 2, the company buys back $109. The fair value of the shares is $11.45 ($10.70 \u2715 ( 1+ .07)), \nwhich allows for a buyback of 9.5 shares ($109/$11.45). This process continues until year 6, when the buyback \nvalue of $772.7 equals the value per share times the shares outstanding ($772.7 = $15.01 \u2715 51.5). After the \nlast buyback the shares outstanding are zero. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nBuyback amount \n$100.0  \n$109.0  \n$118.8  \n$129.5  \n$141.2  \n$772.7  \nStarting shares \n100.0  \n90.7  \n81.1  \n71.4  \n61.6  \n51.5  \nValue per share \n$10.70  \n$11.45  \n$12.25  \n$13.11  \n$14.03  \n$15.01  \nNumber of shares in buyback \n9.3  \n9.5  \n9.7  \n9.9  \n10.1  \n51.5  \nShares after buyback \n90.7  \n81.1  \n71.4  \n61.6  \n51.5  \n0.0  \nReinvestment \n0.0  \n7.0  \n15.1  \n24.5  \n35.3  \n47.6  \nTotal value \n$100.0  \n$216.0  \n$349.9  \n$503.9  \n$680.4  $1,500.7  \nAs with the dividends, we have to consider the proceeds from reinvesting the cash the shareholders received \nwhen they sold their shares to the company. The proceeds are the same as for the dividend plan because the \namount returned and the reinvestment rate are identical. \nThe sum of the aggregate value of the share buyback is $1,371.2 (100 shares at an average cost of $13.71) \nand the proceeds from reinvestment are $129.5. That gets us to $1,500.7.  \nIn reality, the conditions required for equivalence almost never hold. For example, the tax rate for dividends and \nlong-term capital gains is the same for investors who hold shares in accounts subject to taxes, but the amount \nto be taxed can differ. The full dividend amount is taxed but with a buyback only the capital gains are taxed. \nInvestors who sell shares in an amount equivalent to the dividend, creating a homemade dividend, are taxed \nbased on the difference between the price of the sale and their cost basis for the stock. In non-taxable accounts, \nthe tax issue is not relevant. None of this is tax advice, but we want to point out that tax treatment can create a \ndifference in economic outcomes for dividends and buybacks.   \nDividends tend to occur on a specific schedule, with most companies paying every quarter. Buybacks are much \nmore sporadic. We also saw that dividends are much more stable than buybacks (exhibit 33). The assumption \nof identical timing does not reflect how companies actually behave.  \nThe reinvestment rate is also important. Most investors do not reinvest their dividends back into the shares of \nthe company that issued them. They either use the proceeds for current consumption or they reinvest in other \nsecurities or investments. A shareholder who sells to a company in a buyback has similar reinvestment options. \nWhile it is not clear that the recipients of dividends and investors selling their shares back to companies treat \ntheir proceeds differently, it is a strong assumption that they reinvest them in an identical fashion. \nFinally, our example assumed the stock was at fair value. The price of the stock does not matter for the \ncalculation of value from dividends but does matter for the buyback scenario. Our discussion showed that \ncompanies overall tend to be good at timing, which means they buy back stock when it is undervalued and sell \nit when it is overvalued. This creates wealth transfers between shareholders and a disparity between the \ndividend and buyback scenarios. \n \n"

If companies needed \nmoney to reinvest in their operations, then they would have to get investors to buy new offerings of stock. \nInvestors would do that only if they were happy both with the dividends they\u2019d received and the future prospects \nof the company. Markets as a whole know more than any individual or group of individuals. So the best way to \nallocate capital is to let the market do it, rather than the management of each company.
