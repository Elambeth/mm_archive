While these presenters were terrific on balance, none got the\naward for creating the most buzz. That honor went to Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist\nNorman Johnson, who opened his talk in a seemingly inauspicious way: \u201cI\u2019ve been asked here\nto talk about what\u2019s wrong with experts\u2014as an expert in this area\u2014in a subject area, finance,\nthat I know almost nothing about.\u201d1\nWhat did Johnson say to cause these smart investors to slide forward in their chairs? Simply\nput, he showed how diverse groups of \u201caverage\u201d people, acting together, solve problems better\nthan experts do. Johnson illustrated his point by discussing the behavior of social insects,\nincluding ants and bees. It was the incredible performance of these insects, above all, that\nsparked the imaginations of the listeners.\nMost of Johnson\u2019s talk was at the macro level, or how the collective solves problems. This has\nobvious relevance for understanding how market efficiency arises.2 Our focus here is on the\nmicro level or how investors, as individuals, should organize for investment success. While the\nunit of analysis is different, the message is the same: diverse information and perspectives can\nhelp improve investment performance.\nNow think carefully for a moment about your information sources. Do you read the same\nnewspapers, talk to the same people, and review the same type of research reports over and\nover? Or do you allocate time to entertain new ideas, even at the risk of wasting time on\nintellectual cul-de-sacs? There is strong evidence to suggest that the leading thinkers in many\nfields\u2014not just investing\u2014benefit from input diversity.\nA-Mazing\nBefore we dwell on the individual, we would like to show how diversity leads to better answers\nand how a lack of diversity can create inefficiencies. Johnson demonstrates how the collective is\nbetter than the average individual with a maze problem:\n\u2022 \nFirst, he asks individuals of identical capabilities to solve a maze. Because the\nindividuals have no global sense of the problem, they simply explore until they find a\nsolution.\nMichael J. Mauboussin\n212-325-3108\nmichael.mauboussin@csfb.com\nKristen Bartholdson\n212-325-2788\nkristen.bartholdson@csfb.com\nMarch 26, 2002\nVolume 1, Issue 6\nA Process for Outperformance\nThoughts on Organizing for Investing Success\n"

With some learned information, they tend to\nimprove.\n\u2022 \nFinally, he constructs a linear combination of each individual\u2019s experiences and uses the same rules to\nfind a collective solution.\nBecause each individual\u2019s initial search is random, a collection of individuals reflects diverse experience (maze\nregions), preferences (preferred paths), and performance (path lengths). 3 So the collective is really just a normal\nindividual with super information. Because of this diverse information, the collective solution is vastly more robust\nthan average individual solution. (See Figure 1.)\nFigure 1\nThe Collective Beats the Individual\nThe insert in the figure shows the demonstration maze. The main figure shows the effect on the collective solutions as more individuals\ncontribute to the collective solution, for two different sets of random numbers. The number of steps of the collective is normalized by the\naverage number of steps of the individuals contributing to collective solution.\nSource: Norman L. Johnson. See http://www.ishi.lanl.gov/symintel.html.\nThe power of this collective effect has not been lost on nature. This is where Johnson\u2019s stories about ants come in.\nHow do the ants do it? Foraging ants depart the nest with one job in mind, to find and retrieve food. They also\nhave the ability to leave and follow chemical trails. At first, they disperse randomly. When the ants that find food\ncome back to the nest, they leave a chemical trail that their sisters can follow. Studies show that this process\nallows ants to consistently find the shortest path to the food. 4\nOnce researchers understood this collective ability, they decided to play a trick on the ants. In a controlled setting,\nthe scientists placed two food sources at identical path lengths from the nest. As it turned out, the ants ended up\nusing just one of the paths, although which one they chose was random. Why? Because they follow chemical\ntrails, a couple more ants going down one path will attract other ants, triggering a positive feedback loop. So\ninstead of finding an optimal solution, the ants have one crowded path and an equidistant, empty path.\nAmazingly, though, nature anticipated this problem as well. As it turns out, ants periodically break from the main\npath and begin a random search process again. The ants are programmed to strike a balance between exploiting\na known food source and exploring for the next food source. (See Figure 2.) Johnson calls this the \u201cwild hair\u201d\nalternative. The ants are hard-wired to seek diversity.\n"

A lot, as it turns out.\nPhysiologist Horace Barlow says that intelligence is all about making a guess that discovers some new underlying\norder. This includes solving a problem, seeing the logic of an argument, or finding an appropriate analogy.5 Where\ndoes investment intelligence come from?\nHere is where Norman Johnson\u2019s message is so important for investors. In well defined systems, experts are\nuseful because they can provide rule-based solutions. But when a system becomes complex, a collection of\nindividuals often solves a problem better than an individual\u2014even an expert. This means that the stock market is\nlikely to be smarter than most people most of the time, a point the empirical facts bear out.\nTo be an expert in a complex system like the stock market, he continues, you need two essential features. First,\nyou must be able to create a \u201csimulation\u201d in your head, allowing you to conceive and select strategies. 6 A\ndescription of the legendary hedge fund manager George Soros illustrates the point:\n\"[Gary] Gladstein, who has worked closely with Soros for fifteen years, describes his boss as operating in almost\nmystical terms, tying Soros's expertise to his ability to visualize the entire world's money and credit flows. 'He has\nthe macro vision of the entire world. He consumes all this information, digests it all, and from there he can come\nout with his opinion as to how this is going to be sorted out. He'll look at charts, but most of the information he's\nprocessing is verbal, not statistical\u2019.\" 7\nSecond, you must populate your mental system with information from diverse sources. While the ability to simulate\nmay be largely hard-wired (although you can improve your skills in this area), the pursuit of diverse ideas is within\nyour control.\nPsychologist Donald Campbell describes the situation in similar terms, referring to the process of creative thinking\nas \u201cblind variation and selective retention.\u201d In other words, creative thinkers seek a variety of ideas, but only\nchoose those that are useful given their current goals.\nIdea diversity allows you to find what Johnson calls \u201cweak signals.\u201d A weak signal may be the start of a trend that\u2019s\naway from the dominant path (think new technology or development), or the right piece of information at the right\ntime from an unexpected source. In fact, a recent study suggests that informal learning fulfils up to 70% of learning\nneeds inside some organizations.8 It\u2019s often difficult to know where the next beneficial idea will come from.

Investors that have investment approaches, or\ninformation sources, that are too narrow risk missing out on the power of diversity. The downside, of course,\nis that entertaining diverse ideas means sorting through lots of potentially useless input.
