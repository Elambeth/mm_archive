One of the \nbiggest changes in recent years has been the \nrise of index funds. These passive funds, which \ninclude traditional index funds and exchange-\ntraded funds that follow specific rules, have \nreceived the majority of flows from investors in \nthe past decade. While active managers \ncontinue to play a critical role in gathering \ninformation and reflecting it in prices, passive \nmanagers are growing their share of the \nmarket in stocks and bonds.   \nThe most popular indexes in the U.S. are the \nS&P 500 for stocks and the Bloomberg \nBarclays US Aggregate Bond Index for bonds. \nPassive funds can mimic the S&P 500\u2019s returns \nclosely and cheaply, but mimicking the \nreturns for the Bloomberg Barclays US \nAggregate Bond Index is substantially more \nchallenging because it has 20 times the \nnumber of securities, higher turnover, and \nmore frequent rebalancing than the S&P 500. \nThe difficulty in matching the Bloomberg \nBarclays US Aggregate Bond Index spells \nopportunity for active managers. Indeed, a \nmuch higher percentage of bond managers \nthan stock managers beat their passive peers \nover time. One result is that U.S. active bond \nmanagers have received $0.9 trillion in inflows \nwhile active equity managers have suffered \n$1.1 trillion in outflows over the past decade. \nIn this report, Michael reviews the shift from \nactive to passive, discusses the role of skill, \ntakes measure of the opportunities for active \nbond managers, considers what these \ndevelopments mean for asset managers, and \nexamines the history of pre-fee excess returns \nfor bond managers.

Mauboussin \nDirector of Research \nmmauboussin@bmcm.com \n \nThe shift from active to passive management remains one of the hottest \nissues in the investment industry. In this report we examine the shift from \nactive to passive investing in bonds. The migration in stocks has received \nmore attention than that in bonds because the move has been more \ndramatic. The transition in bonds has been less rapid because active bond \ninvestors have outperformed passive alternatives at a higher rate than equity \nmanagers have, even if much of that outperformance can be explained by \nexposure to risk premiums.  \nWe document the shift by examining trends in assets under management and \nflows for active and passive taxable bond funds. Next, we describe the \nchallenges that investors face in identifying skillful managers. We turn to \nmethods for measuring easy games, including a comparison of popular bond \nand stock indexes and a consideration of the participants in the markets. \nFinally, we review the implications for asset managers and conclude with a \nnovel framework for gauging the value that active managers generate.\nIntroduction\nThe growth in passive investing continues to be \nan important topic for investors to consider. \nActive managers select securities in an effort to \ngenerate returns, adjusted for risk, that exceed \ncertain targets. Passive managers create \nportfolios that mirror indexes or follow specific \nrules. Examples of rules-based funds include those \nthat attempt to capture premiums from \nfundamental factors such as size, value, \nmomentum, and volatility. These are commonly \ncalled \u201csmart beta\u201d funds. Passive funds can be \nin the form of traditional index mutual funds or \nexchange-traded funds (ETFs).1  \nThe top panel of exhibit 1 shows that active \nequity funds in the U.S. have suffered $1.1 trillion in \ncumulative outflows in the past ten years, while \nflows into passive funds have approached $2.4 \ntrillion. \nActive managers in the bond market have not \nfared as badly. The bottom panel of exhibit 1 \nreveals that cumulative flows have been positive \nfor both active and passive bond funds. Over the \npast ten years, flows into active bond funds have \nbeen roughly $935 billion and flows into passive \nbond funds have been about $960 billion. The \ntrend has been clearly more favorable for passive \nmanagers since 2012. \n \n"

The percentage of actively-\nmanaged bond mutual funds that have \noutperformed their passively-managed peers is \nmuch higher than that for equities for holding \nperiods of three or more years through 2018. On \nthe surface it is easy to see why investors have \nselected active managers for bonds and \nshunned them for stocks.  \nBut interpreting this apparent difference in results \naccurately requires a deeper appreciation of \ntrue excess returns and exposure to risk factors. \nMost of the outperformance relative to passive \npeers is attributable to traditional risk premiums, \nincluding term, corporate credit, and emerging \nmarkets risk. Intermediate-term bond managers \ngenerally have more credit exposure than their \nbenchmark, and high-yield managers have less \ncredit exposure than their benchmark, allowing \nthe intermediate-term bond managers to have a \nhigher batting average. \nResearch by the Vanguard Group, one of the \nworld\u2019s largest investment advisers, suggests that \nan investor can approximate the performance of \nactive managers benchmarked against the \nBloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index \nwith an 80 percent allocation to a total U.S. bond \nmarket index fund and a 20 percent allocation to \na corporate bond fund with low tracking error \nand fees.2 That said, it is easy to understand why \nan investor who wants to invest in bonds would \nselect an active rather than a passive fund. \nNot all asset classes within the bond universe are \ncreated equally.

For instance, \nthe difference between the 75th and 25th \npercentile managers, measured over three years, \nis roughly 5 times larger for emerging market debt \nthan for long-term government debt.

The first is \njudging which managers are likely to deliver \nattractive returns and the other is assessing the \nattractiveness of the opportunity to express skill. \nA common way to measure skill is to look at \npersistence. Results are persistent in activities \nwhere outcomes are due predominantly to skill \nrather than luck. Think of a world-class musician. \nShe will play beautifully night in and night out. The \nquality of the performance is lasting. Results are \nmore random when luck primarily determines \noutcomes. Yesterday\u2019s lottery winner has no \nbetter a chance to win tomorrow. \nConsistent with the message from exhibit 2, the \npersistence in performance for bond mutual fund \nmanagers tends to be higher than that for equity \nmutual fund managers.6 This means that bond \nfunds that outperform the benchmark tend to do \nso with some consistency.  \nThere are a couple ways to explain that result. It \nmay be the case that there is a lot of variety in \nthe skill of bond managers and that the better \nones outperform the worse ones. It may also be \nthe case that measuring relative results is trickier \nthan it appears. For example, managers may \nhave exposure to a risk factor that a simple return \nfigure fails to reflect and therefore the \noutperformance is really compensation for risk.     \nThe variation of skill is a crucial consideration in \nany competitive domain. One useful concept is \nthe \u201cparadox of skill,\u201d which says that in activities \nwhere both skill and luck contribute to outcomes, \nas skill increases, luck can play a bigger role in \ndetermining results.7 The key to the idea is to \nrecognize that you can measure absolute and \nrelative skill. In nearly all competitive domains, \nabsolute skill has improved. Consider sports \nmeasured against a clock, such as running or \nswimming. Athletes today are faster than their \npredecessors as the result of advancements in \ntechnique, nutrition, coaching, and training.  \nAt the same time that absolute skill has improved, \nrelative skill has narrowed. That means that in a \nfield of competition, the difference between the \nbest and the average player is smaller today \nthan it was in the past. As the level of skill \nbecomes more uniform, the role of luck rises.  \nThe paradox of skill is a big deal in investing. That \nmanager results appear close to random is not \nbecause professional investors don\u2019t know what \nthey are doing. It\u2019s actually the opposite. \nInvestors today are so good that asset prices do \nan effective, albeit imperfect, job of reflecting \nrelevant information.8     \nOne way to measure the paradox of skill over \ntime is to examine changes in the standard \ndeviation of results. Think of it this way: the results \nfor many activities follow a distribution that looks \nlike a bell. Lots of participants are near the \naverage at the top of the bell. The sides that \nslope down from the top represent the under- \nand outperformers. Standard deviation measures \nthe width of the bell. A shrinking standard \ndeviation reveals the paradox of skill, as it \ndocuments the gap between the average and \nthe extreme performers.   \nThe investment management industry measures \nresults through excess returns adjusted for risk \nrelative to an appropriate benchmark, or alpha. \nThe distribution of alpha doesn\u2019t follow a perfect \nbell-shaped curve, but reality is close enough to \nmake the point. Skillful active managers want \nwide distributions so they can earn positive alpha \nwhile less skillful investors suffer negative alpha.       \nExhibit 8 shows the three-year average standard \ndeviation of single-factor alpha for U.S. large \ncapitalization equity mutual funds from 1973 \nthrough 2018. There is a steady decline in \nstandard deviation, save for a brief but explosive \nexpansion during the dot-com bubble. That \nnoted, the standard deviation has rebounded \nmodestly since the financial crisis. In 2018, the \nstandard deviation of alpha was 5.1 percent for \nmore than 2,000 equity mutual funds.\n"

The standard \ndeviation has bounced around, but unlike the \nequity chart there is no clear trend. While bond \nmanagers have certainly become more skillful \nover time, the relative skill gap between the best \nand worst performers has not narrowed as it has \nfor equity managers. In 2018, the standard \ndeviation of alpha was 3.3 percent for nearly \n1,300 U.S. taxable bond mutual funds.  \nAll markets are highly competitive, but the \npersistence and standard deviation of alpha \nsuggest that the opportunity to find managers \nwho may outperform is greater in bonds than in \nstocks. Investment process and time horizon are \nkey for both. But bond markets have more \nsecurities, are more costly to trade, and \nexperience greater turnover. As a consequence, \nit comes as little surprise that fewer equity \nmanagers than fixed income managers \noutperform their respective benchmarks. This is \nconsistent with the more rapid transition into \npassive funds in the equity markets. \nGenerating positive alpha requires applying skill \nthrough a robust process and an ability to find \ninefficiently-priced assets.

AGG had $57 \nbillion in AUM and IVV had $149 billion at year-\nend 2018. We look at three metrics for each: \npercent of index securities held, active share, \nand tracking error.  \nAGG owns 60 percent of the securities in the \nBloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. \nThe leading ETFs that track the index hold \nbetween one-quarter and three-quarters of the \nsecurities in the index. Passive bond managers \nmust decide which securities to own. IVV holds \n100 percent of its benchmark, as do all large \nequity index funds.  \nActive share reflects how much a fund differs \nfrom its index.11 Active share is zero percent if a \nfund exactly matches the index and 100 percent \nif it is completely different. The calculation \nassumes no leverage or short sales. (See \nappendix for more detail.) The active share is 53 \npercent for AGG and 1 percent for IVV. A passive \nbond ETF is less similar to its benchmark than a \ncomparable stock ETF.  \nTracking error, the standard deviation of the \ndifference between the returns of a portfolio and \nthe index, is a measure of how closely a portfolio \nmatches the index. AGG\u2019s tracking error is four \nbasis points, while IVV\u2019s is one basis point. Further, \nthe annualized volatility for the Bloomberg \nBarclays US Aggregate Bond Index is lower on \naverage than that for the S&P 500 index, so the \ntracking error as a percentage of volatility is \nmuch higher for AGG than IVV.  \nExhibit 11 summarizes the differences between \nAGG and IVV and clarifies why equity indexing is \nmore straightforward than bond indexing. \nExhibit 11: Tale of the Tape: AGG versus IVV \nMetric \nAGG \nIVV \nPercent of index securities held \n60% \n100% \nActive share \n53% \n1% \nTracking error (basis points) \n4 \n1 \nSource: Morningstar Direct and ActiveShare.info. \nNote: Percent of index securities held is through \n3/26/2019; Active share as of 3/26/2019 for AGG and \n12/31/2016 for IVV; Tracking error based on monthly \nreturns annualized over three years ended 2/28/2019. \n \nExhibit 12: Tracking Error for Index Funds and ETFs \nBenchmarked to Various Indexes \nCategory \nTracking Error  \n(Basis Points) \nS&P 500 \n2 \nShort-Term Government \n5 \nIntermediate Government \n9 \nMortgage-Backed \n18 \nInflation-Protected \n20 \nIntermediate Investment Grade \n21 \nEmerging Markets \n23 \nHigh Yield \n47 \nSource: Morningstar Direct. \nNote: Monthly returns annualized over three years \nended 2/28/2019; Reflects average of 5 largest funds for \neach category except for mortgage-backed, which \nincludes 3 funds based on data availability. \nWe selected AGG because it is large and can be \nreasonably compared to the Bloomberg Barclays \nUS Aggregate Bond Index. Exhibit 12 shows that \nthe average tracking error for passive bond funds \nranges from 5 basis points for short-term \ngovernment funds to 47 basis points for high yield \nfunds. In each case, the tracking error is \ncalculated using the benchmark noted in the \nfund prospectus. \nWe have seen that it is difficult to build a fund \nthat closely tracks the Bloomberg Barclays US \nAggregate Bond Index. This difficulty creates \nopportunity. Refinancing, maturities, and issuance \npresent ways for active managers to beat the \nbenchmark. This ability is inherently more limited \nfor active equity managers. \nFor example, the issuance of new securities is far \nmore active in the bond market than in the stock \nmarket, creating a potential source of alpha for \nbond managers. There are more new bond issues \nbecause bonds mature whereas equities are \nperpetual. Institutional bond investors purchase \nnew issues from bank underwriters, often at a \ndiscount to similar secondary transactions.  \nThis new-issue yield premium compensates \ninvestors in corporate debt for bearing the \nuncertainty of what the eventual market price will \nbe, as well as other risks. New issues equaled 17 \npercent of total debt outstanding for the \ncorporate debt market in the decade ended \n2018. But research suggests bond investors earn \nreturns, or alpha, that these risks do not fully \nexplain. One argument is that banks underprice \nnew issues to benefit institutional investors. This \neffectively transfers wealth from issuers to \ninvestors.12  \n"

Another aspect to \nassessing how hard it is to outperform a \nbenchmark is a consideration of the other \nparticipants. Nicolae G\u00e2rleanu and Lasse \nPedersen, professors of finance, created a model \nto reflect the reality that for there to be winners, \nthere must be losers (see exhibit 13).13 The core \nidea is that some investors can gather information \nthat is relevant for discerning value, buy and sell \naccordingly, and profit from mispricing. These are \nthe informed asset managers. \nFor some managers to outperform, others must \nunderperform. These are the noise traders and \nnoise allocators, who include retail investors and \nsome issuers. Passive investors neither win nor lose. \nTo the extent that noise traders transition to be \npassive investors, active management can get \neven more difficult because the weak players \nhave left the game.   \nThe model shows why it makes sense for \nunsophisticated investors to participate in most \nmarkets via index funds or ETFs. G\u00e2rleanu and \nPedersen also find that institutional investors tend \nto do better than individuals, reflecting greater \nsophistication and the ability to pay lower costs. \nThe model also reiterates why \u201csearching \ninvestors\u201d can earn higher returns in markets that \nare less efficient. A recent survey of returns to \nactive management found \u201cthat the value of \nactive management depends on the efficiency \nof the underlying market and the sophistication of \nthe investor.\u201d14 Returns to active managers \ndepend on the composition of the market in \nwhich they compete, and the bond and stock \nmarkets are very different.   \nBoth the poker metaphor and the G\u00e2rleanu and \nPedersen model illustrate that part of finding an \neasy game is understanding the other \nparticipants.

For instance, the Federal \nReserve buys bonds to achieve quantitative \neasing and non-U.S. central banks buy \nbonds to stabilize exchange rates.15 This is \nimportant because foreign ownership of U.S. \nTreasury and agency- and GSE-backed \nsecurities has increased substantially in \nrecent decades.  \nFurther, banks are required to hold high-\nquality liquid assets to ensure liquidity. \nBecause the Bloomberg Barclays US \nAggregate Bond Index largely comprises \nU.S. Treasuries and agency- and GSE-\nbacked securities, these non-economic \nowners can influence the price of the \nsecurities and hence the index\u2019s returns. \n\uf0b7 Rules or regulations constrain the bond \nholdings of certain institutions.16 For \nexample, an insurance company that owns \nan investment grade bond may need to sell \nit if it is downgraded to high yield. This leads \nto a lower price on the security than the \nfundamentals justify. In both cases, active \nmanagers can position themselves to \nsidestep these challenges or take \nadvantage of them. This makes it easier to \nbeat the benchmark.   \n\uf0b7 The pattern of fund flows is different in \nequities versus bonds, as we saw in exhibit 1. \nActive U.S. equity managers have realized \noutflows of $1.1 trillion in the past ten years, \nwhereas active U.S. taxable bond managers \nhave seen inflows of $935 billion. While flows \ninto passive bond funds have exceeded \nflows into active bond funds, the story is not \nas one-sided as in equities.17 Flows are \nimportant in investing because they create \na tailwind for funds doing well and a \nheadwind for those performing poorly. \nInvestors generally chase past performance \nby investing in funds that have done well.  \nPortfolio managers who receive inflows \ncommonly purchase more of the securities \nthey already own, boosting the \nperformance of the portfolo.18 \nUnderperforming managers who suffer \noutflows must sell what they hold, \ncompounding performance woes. Flows are \na short-term predictor of results.19  \nThese elements clarify the nature of the game \nactive bond managers play as they seek to \ndeliver returns in excess of a benchmark. First, the \nBloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is \nmarkedly different than the S&P 500 in terms of \nthe number of securities, liquidity, pricing, and \npace of rebalancing. Active managers can more \nreadily distinguish themselves from the \nbenchmark in a way that improves their relative \nperformance. Exhibit 15 summarizes some sources \nof alpha for active bond managers.\nExhibit 15: Sources of Alpha for Active Bond Managers \nSource of Alpha \nMechanism \nNature of market \nBond markets have more securities and turnover and are more costly to trade. \nTaking other side of  \nnon-economic trades \nTaking other side of forced sales or exploiting constraints of other parties: \n     * Central banks: pursue quantitative easing and stabilization of          \n        exchange rates; \n     * Banks: required to hold high-quality liquid assets; \n     * Insurance companies: potential forced selling of downgraded bonds. \nLiquidity provider \nActive managers compensated for providing liquidity to index changes.  \nNegotiation \nTrading over-the-counter versus on exchanges allows for negotiation. \nDispersion in spreads \nDispersion in spreads over Treasuries can present an opportunity as bonds with \nthe same credit rating may offer different yields. \nNew issue premium/wealth transfer Active managers can take advantage of underpricing at issuance. \nRelative value opportunities \nThere can be hundreds of bonds for a single issuer versus usually only one \nstock.

In a competitive market, it would \nbe reasonable to assume that cost and benefit \nare in rough parity.  \nThe trick is to quantify cost and benefit. The \namount of fees that investors pay to active \nmanagers is one approach to quantifying cost, \nand available positive alpha captures benefit. \nWhile much of the investment industry reports \nresults using percentage returns versus a \nbenchmark, the crucial underlying question is \nhow many dollars in excess returns a fund \ncreates.  \nJonathan Berk and Richard Green, professors of \neconomics, created a framework to consider \nexcess returns that captures both cost and \nbenefit.21 They assume that investors seek to give \ntheir money to funds that will generate excess \nreturns but that the more money a skillful \nmanager runs, the lower is his or her expected \nalpha. Their setup suggests that skillful managers \nend up with more money and expected alpha \nmoves toward zero as a fund grows. \nThe Berk and Green framework is similar to \neconomic profit, or a company\u2019s economic \nreturn after considering the opportunity cost of \ncapital.22 Economic profit equals a firm\u2019s return \non invested capital (ROIC) minus its weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) times its invested \ncapital. For example, a firm with a 13 percent \nROIC, an 8 percent WACC, and $1,000,000 in \ninvested capital has an economic profit of \n$50,000 ([0.13 \u2013 0.08] x $1,000,000). \nThe same analysis applies to investment funds. A \nfund\u2019s gross economic profit equals its beta-\nadjusted gross return minus the benchmark \nreturn, multiplied by AUM. We call gross \neconomic profit \u201cgross profit\u201d for short. For \ninstance, a bond fund with average risk that has \na gross return of 9 percent, a benchmark return of \n4 percent, and $100,000,000 of AUM would \nproduce a gross profit of $5,000,000 ([0.09 \u2013 0.04] \nx $100,000,000). Five million dollars is the value the \ninvestment manager extracts from the market. \nBerk and Green find that gross profit is a better \nreflection of skill than simple measures of return. \nHere\u2019s an example. Peter Lynch, who managed \nthe Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments from \nMay 1977 to May 1990, generated an average \nannual return of more than 29 percent per \nannum. Alpha was large but the AUM was small \nin his first five years running the fund. Lynch\u2019s \naverage monthly gross profit was $2.1 million in \n2018 U.S. dollars.  \nPositive alpha was small but the AUM was large in \nthe last five years he ran the fund. Average \nmonthly gross profit was roughly $38 million. Even \nthough Lynch\u2019s alpha was vastly larger in the \nearly years than in the late years, he extracted \nnearly 20 times more value in his last 5 years as a \nresult of the large increase in AUM.23 \nResults for Bill Gross, the famous bond investor \nwho spent the bulk of his career running the Total \nReturn Fund at PIMCO, provide a noteworthy \ncomparison. The average monthly spread \nbetween the fund\u2019s risk-adjusted gross return and \nthe benchmark return, gross alpha, was 0.10 \npercent over Gross\u2019s first five years running the \nfund. His skill allowed him to extract about $1.9 \nmillion per month in 2018 U.S. dollars from the \nmarket.  \nIn his last five years ended in September 2014, the \naverage monthly spread was 0.18 percent, and \nthe average fund AUM was $271 billion. Gross\u2019s \nmonthly value extraction was roughly $500 million. \nThe magnitude of his alpha in the later years was \nroughly double what it was in the early years, \nleading to value extraction that was roughly 270 \ntimes larger because of the substantial increase \nin AUM. \nWe calculate gross profit before fees to \naccurately measure an investment manager\u2019s \nskill.24 Fees finance the manager\u2019s ability to \nexpress skill by unearthing information and pricing \nit in securities. But fees also eat into investor \nreturns. How best to split the fruits of skill between \nmanagers and investors is a topic of debate.   \nWe use the Berk and Green calculation to \nanalyze active mutual funds in the Morningstar \nDirect database that invest in U.S. taxable bonds \nfrom 1978 through 2018. Over the full period the \ndata capture roughly 23,400 fund years and $35 \ntrillion of AUM. The database is free of survivorship \nbias. We show all figures in 2018 U.S. dollars to \nreflect inflation. \n"

In general, the opportunity set \nshrinks as funds get larger because of ownership \nand liquidity constraints.26 But the reversal in the \ntrend for large funds suggests some sources of \nedge. These include superior allocations to new \nissues, better access to information, and more \nflexible mandates.\nExhibit 22: Gross Profit Yield (Trailing Five Years), 1982-2018 \n \nSource: Morningstar Direct. \nExhibit 23: Mutual Fund Size, Gross Alpha, and Gross Profit, 2000-2018 \n \nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\nGross Profit Yield \nTrailing Five Years (Percent)\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nAverage Annual Gross Profit \n(2018 U.S. Dollars, Millions)\nAverage Annual Gross Alpha (Percent)\nDecile (Smallest to Largest AUM)\nGross Alpha\nGross Profit\n"

The jump is particularly \nlarge from the ninth to the tenth decile. The \naverage annual gross profit for the largest 10 \npercent of funds is roughly $120 million per year. \nThe next largest 10 percent, which today have 15 \npercent of the assets, is approximately $20 million \nper year. The smaller funds do well but play for \nlesser stakes. The larger funds have more modest \ngross alpha but play for higher stakes and hence \nextract more alpha from the market. This is \nespecially true for the largest funds. \nMore often than not, headlines broadcasting the \npoor record of active managers rely on results \nwhere each fund has an equal weight. But if the \nBerk and Green framework is correct and more \nskillful investors manage more money than less \nskillful investors, returns weighted by AUM will \nprovide a clearer picture of economic results. \nExhibit 24 reveals that asset-weighted returns are \nconsistently higher than equal-weighted returns \nfor investment-grade and high-yield bond mutual \nfunds. For example, for the 10 years ended \nDecember 31, 2018, the asset-weighted returns \nfor all investment-grade intermediate bond funds \nwas 4.3 percent, roughly 70 basis points higher \nthan equal-weighted returns. \nFees are generally lower for larger funds than for \nsmaller ones, which is part of the reason that \nlarger funds outperform smaller ones. But it is likely \nthat differential skill also contributes to the gap \nbetween asset-weighted and equal-weighted \nreturns. \nExhibit 24: Equal-Weighted versus Asset-Weighted Returns \n  \n \nSource: Aye M.

Active \ninvestors have fared much better in bonds than in \nequities, in part because they have \noutperformed passive alternatives at a much \nhigher rate than equity managers have. While a \nlarge part of that outperformance can be \nexplained by exposure to traditional risk \npremiums, the fact remains that fund investors \nhave realized higher returns owning active funds \nthan they would have owning passive funds.   \nWhile there has been a large move into passive \nfunds, active managers continue to contribute to \nprice discovery and liquidity, which are vital. But \nactive managers charge higher fees than do \npassive vehicles, including traditional index funds \nand ETFs. Passive managers charge lower fees \nbecause they rely on active managers to make \nmarkets efficient. \nMimicking indexes in bonds is not as \nstraightforward as it is in stocks. One reason is that \nthe most popular bond index, the Bloomberg \nBarclays US Aggregate Bond Index, includes \nmore than 10,000 securities versus roughly 500 for \nthe S&P 500 index. As a result, it is very difficult to \ncreate a passive fund that tracks the index with \nnegligible tracking error.     \nOne crucial question in investing is how much \nopportunity there is for active managers to \ncapture alpha. We describe a framework, based \non the work of professors Jonathan Berk and \nRichard Green, to gauge the value that active \nmanagers generate. We find that over the past \nfour decades, cumulative gross profit and fees \nare roughly equal in equities but that gross profit \nexceeds fees in bonds. This suggests investors in \nbond funds have extracted more value from the \nmarket than equity fund investors have. \nGross profit allows us to get away from the \nmisleading results of equal-weighted mutual fund \nreturns and provides figures for both the cost and \nopportunity for active investment management. \n \n"

Active share is zero \npercent if a fund exactly matches the index and \n100 percent if it is completely different. This \nassumes no leverage or short sales. We calculate \nactive share as 100 percent less the sum of the \noverlapping weights between the holdings of the \nfund and the index.   \nHere is a simple example for an equity fund (see \nexhibit 25). The fund holds four stocks (A, B, C, \nand D), and the index holds four stocks (A, B, C, \nand E). We see that A, B, and C are overlapping \npositions and D and E are not. \nExhibit 25: Active Share Example \nHoldings in Either \nFund or Index \nFund \nIndex \nOverlapping \nWeights \nStock A \n50% \n50% \n50% \nStock B \n20% \n25% \n20% \nStock C \n15% \n10% \n10% \nStock D \n15% \n0% \n0% \nStock E \n0% \n15% \n0% \nSum \n100% \n100% \n80% \n           Active Share = 100% Minus Overlap =   20% \nSource: ActiveShare.info; Martijn Cremers, \u201cActive \nShare and the Three Pillars of Active Management: Skill, \nConviction, and Opportunity,\u201d Financial Analysts \nJournal, Vol. 73, No. 2, Second Quarter 2017, 61-79. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor overlapping positions (A, B, and C), the \noverlapping weight is the lower of the two \nweights between the fund and the index. For \nnon-overlapping positions (D and E), there is 0 \npercent overlapping weight. We sum the \noverlapping weights (80 percent) and subtract \nthat sum from 100 percent to arrive at active \nshare (20 percent). Therefore the more the \nholdings overlap, the lower is the active share. \nGross Profit. To calculate a fund\u2019s gross profit, we \nuse the alpha of the oldest share class and an \naggregated size based on all share classes. The \nannual gross profit sums only include funds that \nhave a gross alpha figure for a full calendar year. \nBased on data availability, our gross profit \ncalculations for Peter Lynch and Bill Gross do not \nperfectly align with the months in which their \ntenures began.  \n\uf0b7 Lynch tenure: May 1977-May 1990; Analysis: \nJune 1977-May 1990; \n\uf0b7 Gross tenure: May 1987-September 2014; \nAnalysis: October 1987-September 2014.\n"
