      "text": "The Retailer\u2019s Dilemma\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nExecutive Summary\nThe world of retailing is changing rapidly. Over the last four years, virtually every\ntraditional retailer has grappled with how the Internet will affect its business, and\nhow it should respond. Heading into another crucial season for retailers, many\ninvestors still underestimate the importance of these changes in the retail\nlandscape, as well as the magnitude of the difficulties facing the incumbents\nattempting to assemble a credible online offering.\nA value network is the context within which a firm identifies and responds to\ncustomer needs, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors, and\nstrives for profit. The emergence of a new value network\u2014the online medium\u2014\nposes a menacing challenge to incumbents. The arrival of this new value network\nwas no accident. It has blossomed as a result of demonstrable improvements in\neconomic efficiency as well as increases in customer satisfaction.\nSince Internet-based businesses have lower physical capital requirements, they\ncan thrive with lower operating margins and still potentially generate very\nattractive returns on capital. Those companies savvy enough to take advantage\nof scale and its magnifying effects on asset velocity will ultimately attain returns\non capital meaningfully higher than those unable to scale. At the same time,\nthese leading firms can improve customer satisfaction along many of the key\ndimensions associated with the traditional retail experience.\nThe dilemma for traditional retailers is how to deal with this new value network.\nThis is especially important because most retailers are highly leveraged to\nchanges in incremental revenue. Some view the Internet as a sustaining\ntechnology that merely adds another node of distribution to the traditional retail\noperation. We prefer to view online retail as a disruptive technology. In addition to\npresenting the various strategies, we outline the two greatest challenges for\ntraditional firms\u2014culture and capital.\n\u2022 \nCulture\u2014Companies have difficulty evolving primarily for cultural reasons.\nFirms require the right focus, where change as a source of competitive\nadvantage is baked into the corporate DNA. The right structure is needed to\nfashion a dynamic internal market for ideas, capital, and talent. This allows\nideas to be captured, incubated, and translated into shareholder wealth. And\nthe right incentives are also needed, providing the proper monetary\ninducement to attract the best ideas, capital, and talent.\n\u2022 \nCapital\u2014Many pundits assume that all a traditional retailer needs to do is\nflick a switch, and the infrastructure is online-ready. Nothing could be further\nfrom the truth. The transition to the online world is hardly seamless. By far the\nmost difficult challenge for traditional retailers is dealing with pricing and\nassortment in the new medium. As well, the clash between the physical\ninfrastructure required to support an online business and the retailer\u2019s\nexisting value chain is another roadblock that few have been able to\nnegotiate. The existence of a steep learning curve threatens to leave many\ntraditional retailers behind.\nJust as the potentially superior economics of the online retail model offer no\nguarantee of instant riches, established brands offer no guarantee of online\nsuccess either. Brand means little if firms can\u2019t manage to clear significant\nstructural and cultural hurdles in providing an online offering.\n"

After a period of\nisolation and refinement, the mutants swoop in, overwhelm the center with their\nimprovements, and ultimately become the majority. The edges allow for a period\nof development, where a novel organism doesn\u2019t have to worry about going toe-\nto-toe with the more highly evolved competition.\n1\nAs Kevin Kelly has noted, the same is true of the economic ecosystem: \u201cAt the\nedges, innovations don\u2019t have to push against the inertia of an established\norder.\u201d\n2 The network economy is rife with start-ups, which are free to assemble all\nthe \u201ccompetencies\u201d they need without having to fundamentally rearrange the\nexisting parts of a firm.\nWhile avoiding the explicit use of evolutionary metaphors, Clayton Christensen\nnevertheless documents the effects of a very particular \u201cmutation\u201d in the business\necosystem known as a \u201cdisruptive technology.\u201d We feel this framework holds\ntremendous explanatory power for analyzing business change and is also\nsuitable for understanding the nature of the \u201cdisruptive\u201d change that the Internet\nhas wrought in retailing.\nFigure 1\nConventional Technology S-Curve\nProduct Performance\nFirst technology\nSecond technology\nThird technology\nSource: Innovator\u2019s Dilemma, Clayton Christensen.\nGenerally, performance improvements for a given technological product can be\ncharted along an \u201cS\u201d curve.

Most new\ntechnologies foster improved product performance and are deemed \u201csustaining\u201d\ntechnology. They may be incremental, radical, or even discontinuous in nature,\nbut all sustaining technologies ultimately improve the performance of established\nproducts along the dimensions that mainstream customers in major markets have\nhistorically valued.\n3\nDisruptive technologies, on the other hand, emerge after incubating in their own\nunique value network. If they progress to the point where they can satisfy the\nlevel and nature of performance demanded in another value network, the\ndisruptive technology can invade and knock out the established technology and\nits practitioners\u2014often very swiftly. Dominant firms in a particular industry can\nbecome victims of their own success in relentlessly satisfying customers through\ntheir existing value network. And what astute companies try to avoid is having the\ninflection point on the existing technology\u2019s S-curve passed by an upstart\ntechnology, a \u201cdeath from below.\u201d This requires being mindful of what\u2019s brewing\nin nontraditional value networks.\nInitially, disruptive technologies bring to market a very different value proposition\nthan what had been available prior to their arrival. As well, disruptive technologies\ngenerally underperform established products in mainstream markets. As a result\nthe leading firms often dismiss them. However, they have other features that a\nfew fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive\ntechnologies are usually cheaper, simpler, smaller, or more convenient to use.\n4\n"

What is often\noverlooked when assessing the relatively poor response of traditional book\nretailers to the online threat is that at the time Amazon.com went public, the major\n\u201cbig box\u201d booksellers were busy displacing independent booksellers. They did this\nby providing their customers with a superior value proposition across all\nmeasures of performance: price, convenience, assortment, service, and\nambiance. The introduction of sustaining technology drove strong growth in the\nbusiness.\n5\nTable 1\nThe Book Superstore as Sustaining \u201cTechnology\u201d\nVALUE DIMENSIONS\n Superstore Chain Activity\nPRICE\n Lowered 15% below comparable independent booksellers\nCONVENIENCE\n Expanded store hours, large parking lots, superstore saturation\nASSORTMENT\n Improving breadth and depth of assortment with superstore SKU\nSERVICE\n Knowledgable, friendly, well-trained staff\nAMBIANCE\n Couches, concerts, and mocha lattes\nSource: Company reports and CSFB analysis.\nTraditional book retailers initially marginalized the online threat. After all, it was\ncommonly thought that book buying was a tactile, sensory-rich activity, fit only for\nbrowsing in aesthetically pleasing environments like the superstore. Indeed, this\ntype of shopping behavior had been reinforced through hundreds of years of\npractice, and few book retailers could foresee a credible threat to the system.\nHowever, some customers in the nontraditional value network\u2014ostensibly, those\noutside of the mainstream\u2014were willing to forgo the conventional ambiance and\nservice of the retail experience and began to purchase online.\nThe emergence of a new value network represents a potentially disruptive\ninfluence. However, the technology must satisfy the level and nature of per-\nformance demanded by users in the traditional value network to become truly\ndisruptive.\nThe ability of Amazon.com to make the transition to the traditional retail value\nnetwork required that it satisfy the level and nature of performance demanded in\nthat network. One inherent advantage of the online medium is the ability to\nexplore the logical performance limits of two key retail value drivers: price and\nassortment. Of course, offering customers the ability to purchase virtually any\nbook at any time at a comparable price to the best value available at a bricks-\nand-mortar store is a compelling proposition.\n"

In a\ntraditional retail setting, fulfillment is taken care of at the point of sale\u2014the\ncustomer walks out with the product. Consequently, fulfillment isn\u2019t given a\nsecond thought. Fulfillment is implicit in the retail transaction and is only noticed if\nthe experience is unsatisfactory.\nWhen consumers place an order online and it\u2019s not fulfilled, they definitely take\nnotice. And it is more than likely that customers will go somewhere else the next\ntime around, if they are not turned off to the online market entirely. Reliability is\nfurther fostered by updating customers during every stage in the order- execution\nprocess. Trust takes on heightened importance in electronic markets owing to the\ncyber-separation between buyers and sellers.\n6\nIn the online world, reliability and speed of order fulfillment are crucial value\ndrivers that determine success or failure. This places an inordinate amount of\npressure on the e-tailers\u2019 back-end fulfillment systems, which in many cases are\ncontrolled by a third party. Bringing the fulfillment capability in-house creates a\npotential source of competitive advantage, since it is an essential part of\ncontrolling the customer experience online in addition to holding out the\nopportunity to squeeze out costs down the road. Thus, for example, while some\npundits view Amazon.com\u2019s investments in physical assets as a negative, we not\nonly view them as a positive but believe they are vital to building competitive\nadvantage.\nThe new value network spawned by the online medium promises to unravel the\nlink between the economics of information and the economics of physical goods.\nWithin the context of the traditional retail store, shelf space serves two different\nfunctions simultaneously. It presents information to customers, allowing them to\nmake an informed purchase decision, but it is also inventory that represents a\nposition in the supply chain between the manufacturer and the consumer.\nIf retailers chose to favor the economics of information, they would maximize their\ndisplays to provide a rich selection for their customers. However, physical\neconomics dictates that display must be minimized or at least optimized to control\nthe cost of inventory. Value networks are vulnerable wherever the compromise\nbetween the two sets of economics suppresses value. For example, the\ninformational imperative to offer a wide selection and carry high book inventories\nruns into strong conflict with the logistical imperative of minimizing inventory. The\nnew value network explodes these linkages, unleashing the value that was\nsuppressed in the act of compromise.\n7\n"

However,\nwe believe they were flirting with physical constraints in their ability to allocate\ncapital in a way that enhanced both customer satisfaction and shareholder value.\nThe relationship between customer satisfaction and shareholder value is\npresented graphically in Figure 3.\nFigure 3\nCustomer Satisfaction and Shareholder Value\nValue Maximization\nShareholder\nValue\nCustomer Satisfaction\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSource: The Value Imperative, James M. McTaggart, Peter W. Kontes, Michael C. Mankins.\nEvery product or service generates a value to the customer, which is measured\nby its utility in relation to its price. In turn, products generate value for a company\nand its shareholders in terms of economic profit\u2014or earning a return on capital\nthat exceeds the cost of that capital. When management pursues strategies that\nincrease both customer satisfaction and shareholder value, the two interests are\nfavorably aligned. (See No. 1 in Figure 3.)\nFor shareholders to be enriched, there must be a financial benefit from increasing\ncustomer satisfaction. In some instances, though, companies invest in their\ncustomers to the point where the costs of increasing satisfaction exceed the\neconomic returns. Even before the online medium began to pose a serious threat,\nthe bricks-and-mortar superstores were bumping up against the natural limits of\nwhat they could do to improve the satisfaction of customers. The superstores\ncouldn\u2019t get much bigger or hold much more slow-turning inventory, and prices\ncouldn\u2019t get much lower without seriously jeopardizing the ability to enjoy\neconomic returns down the road. They were rapidly approaching the point of\nvalue maximization depicted in No. 2 of Figure 3, and some would argue had\nalready passed the inflection point.\n8 It was simply a value-destroying proposition\nfor the \u201cbig box\u201d booksellers to take customer satisfaction to the next level.\nDespite providing a great in-store experience, booksellers were committing to a\ncustomer satisfaction strategy that flirted with value destruction. Unlike strategies\nthat inadvertently give operators the flexibility to reduce the costs that don\u2019t\ncontribute to customer satisfaction, the booksellers could not move back along\nthe curve (No. 3 in the graphic). They could not shrink their superstores, scale\nback their inventory and staff, or reduce their operating hours and still provide the\nsame customer experience that was driving sales. Once a bookseller builds a\nstore of a certain size, all the economics of the business are leveraged to a\nparticular top-line result, and small changes in incremental revenues can radically\n"

The value maximization point for booksellers\nwas actually a point of no return.\nCustomer Satisfaction\nThe customer satisfaction proposition inherent in the online value network (lowest\nprice, virtually unlimited selection, and 24-hour shopping) picks up right where the\nbricks-and-mortar firm leaves off. The promise associated with the medium is an\neconomic return that begins at the traditional point of value maximization.\nFigure 4\nCustomer Satisfaction and Shareholder Value in the New Value Network\nShareholder\nValue\nCustomer Satisfaction\n1\n2\n3\n4\nValue Maximization\nSource: The Value Imperative and CSFB analysis.\nAs the online firm aggregates customer information, it makes its site even more\nvaluable to its customers over time. The ability to aggregate actual purchase data\nand \u201ccookie\u201d data, and combine it with demographic data and reported\nregistration data, promises unprecedented insight into customer preferences.\n9\nTailoring the subsequent online experience accordingly translates into greater\ncustomer loyalty and boosts lifetime revenue streams, defraying customer\nacquisition costs and improving the consistency of recurring business. Costs\nactually go down as satisfaction goes up.\nShareholder Value\nInstead of mirroring the curve illustrated in Figure 3 though, the economic\nproposition in the new value network holds out the possibility of proportionately\ngreater returns and market value in exchange for smaller incremental\ninvestments in capital. Of course, these greater returns are not solely dependent\non the smaller asset base in the denominator of the capital turnover equation.\nEqually as crucial is the ability to achieve sufficient scale in the revenue line to\novercome the lower cash margins that are also an inherent feature of the new\nvalue network\u2019s economic proposition. Before an online firm can realize the\nreturns depicted by the slope of the broken line seen in Figure 4 (the linear\nrelationship plotted here is purely for illustrative purposes and does not\nnecessarily reflect the returns from an actual capital commitment), a certain\ncritical scale must be achieved. The ability to finance a brand awareness\ncampaign with cash flow derived from working capital as sales increase is a key\nelement of gaining scale for the online firm.\n"

Therefore, the current online modus\noperandi is to get big, and get broader, fast. The economic advantages\nassociated with scale and scope are too enormous not to go after in a hurry. This\nhas not been lost on the dot com community: for the first six months of 1999 e-\ncommerce brands spent $755.2 million on traditional media advertising,\nsignificantly outpacing the $650 million that was spent in all of 1998.\n11 However,\nword of mouth from satisfied customers continues to be one of the most powerful\ndrivers of online traffic.\nGetting a clearer picture of the potential rewards of this race is crucial when\nattempting to understand the current business environment.

As a more mainstream\naudience begins to alter the composition of the online ranks, there are\nindications that incremental sales will begin to slow and that more and more\nsales will result as a consequence of channel shift.\n13 Traditional firms with\nlarge \u201cinvisible\u201d fixed assets will be disproportionately affected by any\nincremental shifts. This development would certainly put pressure on retailers\nto build out their online operations to give themselves a fighting chance at\nmaintaining their existing sales as opposed to losing sales to the Web\noutright.\n\u2022 \nOnline retailers must realize that comfortably visible offline brands, which can\ndrown out the noise associated with a crowded online field, have an\nadvantage. Although years of accumulated advertising and reinforcement\nprovided by the geography of location are potentially beneficial, ultimate\nsuccess will be determined by the quality of the online experience. Some\nstudies attempting to explain price differences online have concluded that\ncoefficients of determination on the primary retail service characteristics\neither \u201cdo not vary significantly across retailers or are negatively correlated\nwith price.\u201d This suggests that brand, trust, and awareness are potentially key\n"

Threats from larger discount superstores, the potential for\nonline distribution and delivery of product, as well as the need to migrate to a\nlower-cost model were all contributing factors in Egghead\u2019s decision to close its\nretail stores and change its name to Egghead.com. Even though business has\nnot exactly flourished since the change, the company recently garnered seventh\nplace in the National Retail Federation\u2019s ranking of the Top 100 Internet Retailers,\nand it is in the process of merging with online retailer Onsale, Inc.\n21 A continued\ncampaign of building retail locations most certainly would have led to\ndeteriorating returns and bankruptcy for Egghead, as more and more customers\nmigrated away from in-store software purchases. Comparing financial statistics\nfrom fiscal 1995, when the firm had no online sales, with fiscal 1999, when the\ncompany sold merchandise exclusively online, is instructive.\nTable 3\nEgghead Offline, Egghead Online\n4/1/95\n4/3/99\nCash Conversion Cycle\n35\n(4)\nDays Sales Outstanding\n36\n6\nDays in Inventory\n49\n34\nDays Payables Outstanding\n50\n44\nInvested Capital\n146\n$\n34\n$\nNet Sales\n863\n$\n149\n$\nMarket Capitalization (mil)\n147\n$\n465\n$\nMarket Cap/Sales\n0.2\n3.1\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nIn evolutionary terms, there is a certain combination of possible alleles (each\nperson inherits two alleles for each gene, one allele from each parent) in any\npopulation that would produce the optimal set of traits (the global optimum); but\nthere are other sets of alleles that would yield a population almost as adapted\n(local optima).

Abandoning prior success, with the significant investments in both\nemotional and physical capital that have already occurred, is the chief cultural\nbarrier to becoming a full-fledged adopter.\nExample: Most analyses of the online retail business place companies like book\nretailer barnesandnoble.com and toy retailer toysrus.com squarely in the \u201cadopt\u201d\ncamp. Despite \u201cseparation\u201d from their respective parent organizations, we prefer\nto categorize them as straddlers because the umbilical cord has not been\nsevered. Both are struggling with the challenge of leveraging their legacy value\nchain into the world of online retail.\n24\nBarnes & Noble was one of the first companies of note to establish a separate\nonline business unit. In early 1996, Steve Riggio, CEO of bn.com until December\n1998 and the intellectual force behind the firm\u2019s initial online efforts, had an\nepiphany.\n25 Realizing that it was better to gear up for channel shift than allow\nothers to cannibalize its core business, Riggio developed an explicit \u201cstraddle\u201d\nstrategy that took advantage of the company\u2019s superstores, including gift\ncertificates redeemable in superstores, in-store kiosks, and a store-based returns\npolicy for anything ordered online. However, faced with Amazon\u2019s continued\ndiscounting, this effort was scrapped because of margin-related pressure.\nThe lower cost structure of the online model, unencumbered by bricks-and-mortar\nretail locations, supported pricing that threatened the ability of Barnes & Noble to\nadopt a straddle strategy and compete effectively. The implications of the margin\nand capital turnover tradeoff (Figure 5) are that traditional retailers cannot\nsimultaneously compete on price\u2014jeopardizing margin\u2014and sustain satisfactory\nreturns. Their value maximization strategies give them little room to compete.\nTaking a look at the current operating efficiency of barnesandnoble.com versus\nAmazon.com is revealing.\nTable 4\nCash Conversion Cycle\nbarnesandnoble.com\nAmazon.com\nBNBN\nAMZN\nDays In:\nSales\n17.5\n2.9\nInventory\n6.0\n21.7\nPayables\n10.2\n60.5\nCash Conversion Cycle:\n13\n(36)\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nDespite the fact that Barnes & Noble holds virtually all of the online firm\u2019s physical\ninventory\u2014its days in inventory figure reflects this favorable relationship\u2014\nbn.com\u2019s poor payable terms more than offset this benefit.

This is just one of\nthe many limitations imposed by the relationship.\n26\nBn.com is not the only company working within the confines of a structure\nimposed by its traditional retail roots. Toysrus.com faces similar challenges. In\naddition to a secular shift in buying patterns in the toy industry (more software\npurchases, as well as kids growing out of traditional evergreens at a faster rate),\nToys R Us suffered some market share erosion over the past holiday season and\nfell behind Wal-Mart as the leading toy seller. Having barely weathered the storm\ncreated by discounters, Toys R Us was thrown for another loop by the online\nthreat. Toys R Us has since responded with a strategy that further reveals the\ntrue difficulties of attempting to straddle both worlds. Recent management turmoil\nat the company underscores some of the more important conflicts.\n\u2022 \nRobert Moog, CEO of toysrus.com, left the firm at the beginning of July.\nMoog wanted the maximum freedom to search for best prices from vendors\nin order to roll out an aggressive pricing format that would challenge other\nonline retailers. Toys R Us preferred to work within its traditional sourcing\narrangements and not risk channel conflict by antagonizing existing store\nfranchisees with potentially lower prices online.\n\u2022 \nBenchmark Capital, toysrus.com\u2019s venture capital partner, pulled out of the\njoint venture at the end of August. The partnership dissolved because of\ndifferences over ownership of the independent company and whether or not it\ncould be capitalized independently. These conflicts highlight the incentive-\nbased cultural differences between the two parties.\n\u2022 \nCEO of Toys R Us, Robert Nakasone, resigned during the week following the\nblow-up of the Benchmark deal. He cited a difference of opinion with\nChairman Michael Goldstein as a key reason for the move.\nEndure\u2014Companies that endure believe that a certain percentage of their\ncustomer base might be lost to the online medium, but that their core customers\nwill continue to make purchases in a traditional manner. Therefore, a minimalist\nonline strategy is pursued, if any is engaged in at all.\nExample: Borders Group has been consciously pursuing a conservative Internet\nstrategy and has conceded the space to rivals. Management has done the\nnumbers and doesn\u2019t like the return on investment; therefore, it wants to raise\nawareness about the firm\u2019s buildings. Borders thinks that it can grow and\ncontinue to make money while pursuing a \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d model.\nIn this way Borders is staying focused on its capital investment strategy of\nbuilding superstores and thus has simultaneously been characterized as burying\nits head in the sand with respect to the online threat. Investors have been given\nthe task, says management, of recognizing a bifurcation in the book market. A\ncertain class of buyer is still going to continue purchasing in bookstores, and\nBorders wants to be there servicing customers in the traditional value network.\n27\nTable 5 summarizes the various decisions that traditional retailers can make.\n"

Individual organisms do not evolve; they retain the same\ngenes throughout their lives. Only populations evolve. The impossibility of genetic\nchange in individual organisms during their lifetime mirrors Christensen\u2019s own\nview that old-line companies that excelled before the Internet only have one\npossible recourse in the new environment:\n \u201cThey [must] set up a completely independent organization and let that\norganization attack the parent. If you try to address this opportunity from inside\nthe mainstream, the probability of success is zero. I\u2019ve never seen it happen. You\nneed to have a different business organization concentrating on building a\nbusiness model appropriate to the future while the existing organization can focus\non the client base that\u2019s still uncomfortable with the Internet.\n28\u201d\nIn the Christensen view, no \u201cstraddle\u201d response to the Internet will succeed,\nregardless of form. For traditional firms, we believe the barriers to mounting an\neffective response can be classified under two categories, culture and capital.\nCulture\u2014Companies have difficulty evolving primarily for cultural reasons. The\ntremendous innovation and wealth creation in Silicon Valley stems from a\nbusiness ethos that is rooted in opportunity-focused resource attraction, not\nefficiency-focused resource allocation.\n29 The organizational \u201cstructure\u201d of Silicon\nValley allows for ideas, capital, and talent to move freely to create whatever\ncombination enjoys the best chance of generating wealth. For companies that\nadopt the Silicon Valley mindset where the best ideas rule\u2014and where structures\nare in place to capture and develop them\u2014change becomes baked into the DNA\nof the organization.\n30 We believe that this is a vastly underestimated source of\ncompetitive advantage.\nInnovation and growth do not emerge through rigorous planning, but through a\ncombination of local randomness and global structure.\n31 A structured process is\ncompletely predictable both locally and globally; hence it cannot grow or adapt,\nwhile a chaotic system is unstable at both levels. Complexity theory suggests that\na robust structure emerges from the interaction of autonomous agents. The pace\nof current technological change has increasingly challenged corporations where\nthe wealth-creating prospects lie in streamlining, reengineering, and optimizing\nthe organization. When considering the traditional corporate pyramid, local\ndiversity is typically squelched at the idea phase by top management. Gary\nHamel has taken note of some of the management traits: a considerable amount\nof emotional equity invested in the past, little genetic diversity in terms of thinking\nabout the business, and a protective complacency that stems from already\n\u201chaving made it.\u201d Culture represents:\n\u2022 \nThe right focus. Where change is baked into the corporate DNA as a\nconsequence of efficiency-focused resource allocation.\n\u2022 \nThe right structure. Where the firm has a dynamic internal market for ideas,\ncapital, and talent so that ideas can be captured, incubated, and translated\ninto shareholder wealth.\n\u2022 \nThe right incentives. Providing the proper monetary incentives to attract\nideas, capital, and talent. This typically entails significant equity ownership.\nCapital\u2014As a new distribution channel, the Web offers firms the ability to \u201cact\nlocally and sell globally,\u201d giving customers the opportunity to purchase products\n"

Intuitively, this proposition would seem to combine the\nbest of all possible worlds for traditional firms that can tap the power of both the\nonline and offline worlds. Thus far, reality has served as an unwilling partner with\nmany offline merchants. Many pundits assume that all a traditional retailer needs\nto do is flick a switch and the retail infrastructure is online-ready. Nothing could be\nfurther from the truth. The transition to the online world will continue to be far from\nseamless.\n\u2022 \nAssortment. The degree and volume of rhetoric surrounding the product\nassortment debate has increased noticeably over the last year. \u201cThe pure\nplay\u201d online merchants continue to insist that the bricks-and-mortar guys just\ndon\u2019t get it. They state emphatically that famous brands just don\u2019t matter\nonline and that consumers want to pick from a vast selection of offerings, not\njust the goods available from one company. Traditional merchants will\nincreasingly respond with a \u201cwhom do you trust\u201d campaign. But traditional\nfirms face very real conflicts with their investments in physical stores. Should\nthe Web site offer more stock-keeping-units (SKUs) or less, or merely all the\nproducts that a customer can reasonably expect in the company\u2019s stores?\n\u2022 \nPrices. By far the most difficult struggle for traditional retailers is dealing with\npricing in the new medium. The dilemma is that the online channel affords\nlower price points, which conflict directly with the company\u2019s in-store-pricing\nstructure derived by an altogether different calculus (involving different supply\nchain and overhead requirements). Offering lower prices online risks\ncannibalization of stores, conflicts with franchisees, creates store-based\nreturn or servicing issues, as well as complicates the incentive structure for\nsalespeople. In addition, the issue of taxes is a crucial one. For the most part,\ncompanies with physical infrastructure in a particular state must charge sales\ntax for buyers in their respective state.\n32\n\u2022 \nInfrastructure. The clash between the physical infrastructure required in the\nonline space and the existing logistics chain that most traditional retailers\n(non-catalog) support is another roadblock for traditional retailers. Sending\nlarge pallets of goods to a finite number of locations is an entirely different\nproposition than the one demanded by online commerce; that is, shipping\nsmall packages marked for delivery anywhere in the world. Proximity to\ncompany-owned stores rather than ground shippers like UPS is another\nlogistical challenge that traditional retailers face. Rather than \u201chome grow\u201d the\nassets required for this type of business alignment, many traditional retailers\nhave chosen to contract out the necessary fulfillment and distribution\nfacilities. This option, while compelling for retailers that can ill afford to see\ndormant distribution capacity, is not as simple as it seems. The demands of\nreal-time inventory (product availability and shipping status) force retailers to\nclosely integrate distribution with Web operations, requiring personnel on\nboth ends to seal the deal. In addition, fulfillment costs are typically 10% of\neach sale.\n33\n\u2022 \nLearning curve. The actual technological infrastructure required to integrate\nthe transaction origination function with fulfillment and servicing not only\nneeds to be in place, but also must run seamlessly. Improvement and\nstreamlining of this process require a long learning curve. Many traditional\nretailers familiar with the intricacies of in-store customer service are\nnecessarily unfamiliar with the finer points of remote customer service. With\nthe entire enterprise geared toward optimization of the in-store customer\nexperience, it is understandable that there is also trouble with executive\nbuy-in and staff support. The reporting, budgeting, and direction-setting\nelements of the online effort can easily run into conflicts with other business\nsegments.\n"

We prefer to\ndepart from the orthodoxy of theory, though, and take a less absolutist stance. A\nnumber of traditional retailers, notably those with \u201cbranded\u201d products and\nconsumer direct infrastructure (a legacy of catalog operations), have met with\nsome online success. However, traditional retailers of unbranded general\nmerchandise have not had any impact online. We believe this is due to the\ncultural and capital challenges previously outlined. Nonbranded hard goods\nretailers that operate solely online, like Value America, which offers enormous\nselection and low prices, have not seen appreciable gains in shareholder value.\nThe lack of brand visibility, coupled with each individual manufacturer drop-\nshipping goods at different times with varying degrees of service, does not create\na differentiated customer experience. Wal-Mart\u2019s initial online effort, begun in\n1996, suffers from some of the same difficulties, even though it is one of the\nstrongest brands in retail.\nDespite the burgeoning influence of the online medium on retail, the fundamental\nvalue drivers that determine a satisfactory customer experience are still the\nsame. Much of the debate surrounding the merits of a pure online versus pure\noffline focus obscures the fundamental point that retail at its root is about\nacquiring and retaining as many profitable customers as possible. And this\nrequires delivering product from the manufacturer to the buyer in the most\nefficient manner possible.\nThe rhetoric surrounding \u201casset-free\u201d online models and top-heavy bricks-and-\nmortar firms will eventually yield to a discussion about which retailers can best\nattract customers and assemble the value-chain capabilities necessary to deliver\nthe product. Online operator Amazon.com, which has proven to be disruptive, has\nbeen able to satisfy the level and nature of service demanded by customers in\nthe traditional value network. The day that Amazon.com is widely considered to\nbe an \u201cexcellent retailer\u201d rather than an \u201cexcellent online retailer\u201d will signal the\nshift to post-Web retail. We believe that this day is fast approaching and that\nmany traditional retailers are unprepared.\nThe new value network promises increases in customer satisfaction as well as\noperating efficiencies that will drive extraordinary economic returns for some\ncompanies. Online firms are more efficient out of the starting gate, and hence\nhave an advantage in assembling the necessary competencies required to\ncompete effectively. Over the last year, many traditional retailers have shifted\ntheir asset bases to reflect the impact of the new medium. Similarly, many online\nfirms have acquired the necessary \u201creal-world\u201d assets to more effectively deliver\ntheir products and promote their brand. (See Appendix A.)\nMany conventional retailers are attempting to cast the Internet as a sustaining\ntechnology. For example, an online purchase with consumer pick-up at the local\nstore is commonly viewed as the best of both worlds. (See Figure 9.) And\nassuming a retailer can surmount the technological difficulties, in-store fulfillment\nmay serve to be an adequate approach for the short term. In the long run though,\nall roads lead directly to the consumer.\n"

Paying online\nand picking up a bag of goods at a checkout window is even better.\n34 However,\nconsider that a consumer willing to use a computer to search for a product is\neither familiar enough with the item to want to order it locally and pick it up\nimmediately or is already comfortable enough with the online medium to search\nfor a product online. The reticence regarding consumer direct shipment primarily\nrevolves around uncertainty about the payment transaction or the actual delivery\nof the item. We would offer the following considerations for traditional retailers\nthat feel a sustaining approach is all that is necessary:\n\u2022 \nConsumer uncertainty regarding delivery and payment stems more from\nthe medium than any inherent product features. A sustaining technology\nresponse is just an intermediate solution to assuage the threat of a new\nmedium. There is a thin line between ordering a product online and then\npicking it up in a store, and forgoing the trip to the store altogether and\nhaving it delivered. Internet technology is still in its infancy, and online\nviewing capabilities will be radically improved in coming years. Retailers\nneed to make the necessary investments today.\n\u2022 \nTraditional retailers offering in-store fulfillment still need to provide their\ncustomers with direct delivery, primarily because a competitor already is.\nConceding consumer direct entirely is not a viable long-term proposition\nand amounts to an endure strategy. In addition, if the consumer direct\nexperience is a bad experience, consumers will switch.\n\u2022 \nLocal distribution to solve the \u201clast mile\u201d problem will ramp up\ndramatically over the next couple of years, leading to faster, cheaper,\nand more efficient shipment of goods to online consumers. The\nemergence of Webvan and the success of companies like Kozmo.com\nindicate that profit opportunities in the delivery of goods ordered online\nare viable. Trustworthy delivery will become a source of competitive\nadvantage.\n\u2022 \nYounger generations are growing up with the online medium. Some\nstudies conclude that Generation Y will set off another e-commerce\nsurge around 2010, as they enter their prime earning years.\n35 Teenage\nResearch Unlimited has estimated that 70% of \u201cteenagers\u201d between the\nages of 12-19 are online during any given week.\nThe focus of the retail discussion no longer revolves around the purity of the\n\u201cassetless\u201d online model in contrast with bricks and mortar. Two worlds are\ncolliding. The online community is evolving from a user base with a specialized\npsychographic to a more mainstream orientation.

      "text": "The Retailer\u2019s Dilemma\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nAppendix A: Not Convergence\nThe online versus offline debate has gotten a little bit more complicated over the\nlast year. Traditional retail responses are about as varied as the companies\nthemselves. However, hard goods retailers face some unique challenges with\nrespect to transitioning to the online medium. As noted previously, some\ntraditional branded hard goods retailers like The Gap, REI, and The Sharper\nImage have met with some success online. In addition, the office supply segment\nhas made giant strides online. With local distribution in place and geographic\ndensity in its customer base, Office Depot noted in its most recent quarter that it\ngenerated $98 million in sales online. However, no unbranded general\nmerchandise retailer from the ranks of traditional bricks-and-mortar firms (geared\nprimarily toward consumers and not business to business) has been able to make\nthe transition into the online space with any success. The medium inherently\nlends itself to fulfilling three key dimensions of value that many \u201cbig box\u201d general\nretailers have thrived on in the past\u2014price, assortment and convenience\u2014thus\nhindering meaningful differentiation online. The general trend in recent years has\nbeen toward bigger stores with bigger assortments and lower prices, resulting in\nthe category killers.\nLike a diet that is simple to understand but hard to execute, many firms will not\nsucceed. Shedding pounds is harder than gaining weight, and it\u2019s a lot easier to\nstart with a virtual business and add capital as appropriate than to start with lots\nof capital and then go virtual.\nBuying E-commerce: Federated Department Stores\nWith the purchase of direct marketing firm Fingerhut Companies Inc. in March\n1999 for $1.7 billion in cash and $200 million in debt, FDS signaled its interest in\nowning what it hopes will become the \u201clargest direct to the consumer business on\nthe Internet.\u201d Now holding partial or full interest in 12 Internet businesses, FDS\ngained a number of crucial competencies with the acquisition of Fingerhut, such\nas product fulfillment through three regional distribution centers with 4 million\nsquare feet of distribution capacity, capable of picking and packing 20,000 orders\nper hour and shipping over 400,000 parcels per day; order management allowing\nthe firm to track order and credit information for up to 100 million transactions per\nyear; direct marketing that supports 30,000 telemarketing calls per hour and 4\nbillion print and electronic advertising materials; information systems, which can\nprocess 80 million orders per day; and returns processing, which can process\n30,000 returns per day.\nThe acquisition of online assets hasn\u2019t been limited to broadline retailers either.\nThe 40-year old Columbia House record club, jointly owned by Sony and Time\nWarner, recently announced an agreement to purchase CDNow, the largest pure-\nplay online music seller. In addition, venture capital-funded operations like\nNordstrom\u2019s online shoe store, and Procter & Gamble\u2019s reflect.com (an\nexclusively online brand of beauty products), have both shown savvy in dealing\nwith the culture and capital challenges outlined in the report.\nClosing Stores: Lands End\nLands End, the catalog retailer that has emerged as one of the leading online\napparel retailers, reported Internet revenue of $61 million in 1998 (which was\nroughly three times more revenue than in 1997). The firm has seen strong\ndemand for discounted items and has created an online category called \u201cOn the\nCounter,\u201d where shoppers can peruse a selection of weekly overstocks. This\nchannel has proven so popular with consumers, allowing the firm to liquidate\ninventory balances at higher recovery rates, that Lands End announced the\n"

Although relatively insignificant in overall revenue contribution (4% of\nsales), the impact of the medium is being felt in the physical world. The ability to\neliminate overstocks \u201cglobally\u201d versus a geographically limited area is promising.\nSenior management for the mass retailers is now beginning to confront the\ninherent contradiction between leveraging the online sales channel and\ncontinuing to lease stores in the present fashion. Many studies currently being\nconducted by the real estate industry are examining the impact of online buying\non retail property values and unit expansion.\n36\nSynchronizing Channels: Sharper Image\nSome traditional bricks-and-mortar firms have successfully made the transition to\nthe online medium, like retail powerhouse The Gap, cooperative outdoor\nspecialist REI International, and specialty products retailer The Sharper Image.\nAll of these firms share two things in common: each sells branded, proprietary\ngoods, and each had the necessary back-end fulfillment capabilities in place to\ndeliver direct to the consumer (as a result of existing catalog operations).\nIn fiscal 1998 The Sharper Image generated revenue of $4.9 million from its\nonline operations, up from $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in the\nprevious two years. While 67% of the firm\u2019s total revenue comes from its 85\nstores, The Sharper Image has decided to proceed at a moderate pace in its unit\nlevel growth (5%), partly because of a focus on moving its established customer\nbase online. Aligning its products, pricing scheme, and promotional efforts across\nchannels has given The Sharper Image some measure of online success.\nBits to Atoms\nBuying Fulfillment: Amazon.com\nAmazon\u2019s build out of 5 additional distribution centers in a time frame of less than\n12 months has given many observers pause. The additions will ultimately move\nthe company into a position of owning over 5 million square feet of distribution\ncapacity versus 330,000 square feet in 1998. With 1998 capacity supporting\nroughly $1 billion in sales, the new capacity addition will ultimately support over\n$7 billion in sales, assuming the firm hits its sales per square foot target of $1500\n(which is half the sales per square foot amount achieved on run-rate fourth\nquarter 1998 numbers with only books and music). Amazon understands that\ncontrolling all aspects of the online customer experience can lead to competitive\nadvantage, and owning fulfillment assets contributes to this goal while\nsimultaneously offering the possibility of squeezing efficiencies out of the\ndistribution system.\nEven with the extra capacity build, fixed costs and working capital requirements\nas a percentage of sales are both a fraction of what is traditionally seen in the\nbricks-and-mortar retail universe. Traditional retailers pay to have product\nshipped to aesthetically pleasing stores (costing millions) that are within driving\ndistance of their customers. Traditional retailers finance the storage of these\nproducts until customers decide to buy them, and all to generate roughly the\nsame amount of money per product that online retailers receive. Online firms\nadding distribution capacity in no way begin to approximate the capital costs of\ntraditional retail. Despite having the opportunity to continue leveraging the mature\nfulfillment capacity of their parent organizations, both barnesandnoble.com and\ntoysrus.com have decided to acquire or have already acquired their own internal\nfulfillment assets.\nStorefront: Gateway\n"

In addition to doing brisk business online, Gateway has\nbuilt out 168 freestanding brick-and-mortar storefronts that essentially carry no\ninventory. All order fulfillment is handled through the company\u2019s existing\ndistribution channels and shipped directly to the customer\u2019s home. Costing $500-\n700,000 per store, and amortized over a period of 3-5 years, Gateway has to only\nsell 100 units per week for the stores to break even. Beating forecasts, these\nstores have managed to achieve average selling prices 10% higher than the\nstores in the firm\u2019s existing channels. Acquiring bricks-and-mortar storefronts and\nleveraging Gateway\u2019s existing distribution system has allowed the company to\nsatisfy a rich market segment uncomfortable with online purchases (the first-time\nbuyer) while making its brand more visible in the eyes of the consumer.\nOther companies associated with online retailing have contemplated the\nintegration of physical retail assets with their existing online offerings. Tandy, the\nparent company that owns the ubiquitous RadioShack stores, has stated that it\nhas been approached by several Internet retailers interested in setting up kiosks\nin RadioShack locations for deliveries and returns. Pooling deliveries to a central\nlocation, such as a RadioShack store, would help solve some of the \u201clast mile\u201d\ndelivery cost problems, and possibly bring down the costs associated with\ntraditional shipment. Cyberian Outpost, an online computer and electronics\nretailer, recently formed an alliance with Tweeter Home Entertainment Group to\ntake advantage of Tweeter\u2019s supply relationships and physical infrastructure.\nPartnerships: Drugstore.com\nRite Aid Corporation, General Nutrition Centers, and online pharmacy\ndrugstore.com recently announced a long-term strategic partnership. The terms\nof the agreement give traditional pharmacy retailer Rite Aid a 25.3% stake in\ndrugstore.com (and a seat on the board). This is in exchange for a $7.6 million\ncash investment, as well as allowing drugstore.com access to the 50 million\nindividuals covered by Rite Aid\u2019s pharmacy benefit manager subsidiary, PCS\nHealth Systems. For drugstore.com, the deal reflects the urgent need to scale its\noperations quickly in the face of stiff competition. Although the company could\nhave eventually assembled the necessary insurance relationships on its own, the\nrealities of customer acquisition costs forced the firm\u2019s hand and highlighted the\nsignificant value of the PBM. Nevertheless, the relationship holds out the\npossibility of generating considerably more traffic for drugstore.com by leveraging\nthe customer base and marketing ability of both Rite Aid and GNC, as well as\ngaining the benefit of Rite-Aid purchasing power and the ability to offer customers\na multiple channel offering.\nIn addition to partnerships, some online companies are buying traditional firms in\nrelated industries. Online content vertical iVillage purchased Lamaze publishing,\na producer of magazines and videos for expectant mothers, while online\nauctioneer eBay recently purchased bricks-and-mortar auction house Butterfield\n& Butterfield.\n"

It was formed by outsiders that pitched the idea to Ace Management,\nstrategically integrating both operations from the outset.\n25 Wired Magazine interview with Steve Riggio, June 1999, by Warren St. John.\n26 The company cannot sell non-English language books except through links with\nBertelsmann, nor can it engage in the Internet book club business or sell textbooks using\nthe Barnes & Noble name.\n27 Borders has begun an effort to include online kiosks in its stores that allow for\ndelivery direct to the consumer. Although this may seem like a straddle strategy, the\ncompany\u2019s future growth is not seen as being vitally linked to the online medium.\n28 Business Week interview with Clayton Christensen June 28, 1999.\n29 \u201cBringing Silicon Valley Inside,\u201d Gary Hamel, Harvard Business Review, September-\nOctober 1999. Just like communism and capitalism were competing economic regimes,\nresource allocation and resource attraction are competing innovation regimes.

In general Internet sales are treated as mail order sales: no sales tax is\ncollected from companies that do not have a presence (no nexus) in the state. The\ntransactions are not legally free, however. Every state requires consumers to pay a use\ntax (at the sales tax rate) for any out of state catalog or Internet purchases. A Supreme\nCourt ruling has effectively forced government to rely on self-reporting. Noncompliance\nis rampant, so most transactions are effectively tax-free.\n33 The benefits of internal fulfillment have been recognized by a number of prominent\nonline retailers with sufficient scale in their operations. The most developed group of\nonline retailers, with traditional roots, has also come around to the virtues of internal\nfulfillment capability, namely: Barnes&Noble.com and toysrus.com. The ability of\nonline firms to increase scope easily and segue into other product categories necessitates\nrapidly scalable distribution.\n34 The cost of online returns is significant for retailers, and some studies have\ndemonstrated customer willingness to purchase through traditional retailers with an\nonline offering, assuming an in-store return policy is in place.\n35 \u201cPost-Web Retail,\u201d Seema Williams, The Forrester Report, September 1999.\n36 \u201cNowhere Yet Everywhere: Investigating Online Buying\u2019s Impact on Retail Property\nValues,\u201d Mark Borsuk, American Real Estate Society, April 1999.\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n"
