This change has had reverberations for asset \nmanagers, investors, executives, and policy makers.  \nIn this report we seek to answer the following questions:  \n\u2022 What have been the major drivers behind the shift from public to \nprivate equities in the U.S.? \n\u2022 Why are there fewer public companies today than there were 25 \nyears ago? \n\u2022 What are the long-term trends in buyouts? \n\u2022 What are the long-term trends in venture capital? \n\u2022 Where do we go from here? \nMarkets have become more sophisticated over time as the result of the \ngrowth in institutional money management, financial innovation, and \nsharply lower technology costs. Large institutional investors, including \npension funds and endowments, face the prospect of swelling future \nliabilities and diminished expected returns for most asset classes. As a \nresult, they have reduced their portfolio allocation to public securities and \nhave increased their allocation to private equity, where returns have \nhistorically been higher. \nFrom the end of World War II through the early 1970s, many companies \nwent public to raise capital to fund their growth. Today, young companies \noften rely more on intangible assets and have a less voracious appetite \nfor capital. They also have unprecedented access to capital through the \nprivate markets. Consequently, many young companies have elected to \nstay private longer than did the companies of prior generations. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

This change has had reverberations for \nasset managers, investors, executives, and policy makers. \n\u2022 U.S. domestic equity mutual funds manage about $8.4 trillion, with active funds controlling $5.6 trillion and \nindex funds $2.8 trillion at year-end 2019. Buyout funds in the U.S. have $1.4 trillion in assets under \nmanagement (AUM), including $560 billion in \u201cdry powder.\u201d Venture capital funds have AUM of \napproximately $455 billion, which includes dry powder of $120 billion. The equity capitalization of the U.S \nstock market is roughly 27 times the size of AUM for buyout funds and more than 80 times the size of \nventure capital funds. \n\u2022 The median public market equivalent (PME) return has been about 1.2 for buyout funds and 1.0 for venture \ncapital over the last 30 years. These headline figures belie a lot of complexity. For example, competing \ndata sources produce different results, and the returns for managers are highly dispersed. \n\u2022 Returns for top venture capital funds are persistent, whereas there is limited evidence for persistence in \nbuyout funds since 2000. \n\u2022 Drivers of the shift from public to private equity include investors seeking higher returns, changes in \ninstitutions and technology, and legislation. \n\u2022 There are about 3,600 public companies in the U.S. today, about one-half as many as there were in 1996 \nand three-quarters as many as there were in 1976. The drop reflects active M&A activity and a low level \nof initial public offerings (IPOs). More than 90 percent of the stocks that have disappeared since 1996 \nwere those of small- and micro-capitalization companies. \n\u2022 The drop in listings means that public companies today are much larger and older on average than the \npast population of companies. M&A has led to more concentration in most industries, and listed companies \nalso have a high proclivity to pay out capital. \n\u2022 Buyout activity has been up in the last few years, albeit still below the peak of 2007. On average, deals \nare now larger and more expensive than those of the past. \n\u2022 Exits for buyouts are dominated by strategic sales to other companies. In recent years, there has been \nrapid growth in sales to other private equity firms. \n\u2022 There is a strong negative correlation between the average price paid for businesses and subsequent \nPMEs in the buyout business. Multiples in 2019 were at a record. This concern is partially mitigated by \nlow interest rates. \n\u2022 Venture capital is more cyclical than either public markets or buyouts, and recent annual investment levels \nhave been high. \n\u2022 Exits in venture capital (VC) used to be primarily via IPOs, but today sales to other companies dominate. \nThe average age of a company at IPO is higher than before, and VC firms wait longer to do IPOs. \n \n \n"

There has been a meaningful evolution \nin the form in which companies invest. Tangible investment was double that of intangible investment in the mid-\n1970s, and intangible investment is one-and-a-half times tangible investment more recently.1 As a consequence, \ncompanies need less capital to fund their operations and hence the demand to raise capital through public \nmarkets has diminished. \nIn recent decades, sophisticated investors, including pension funds and endowments, have moved their asset \nallocation toward private markets in search of higher returns. For example, Yale University\u2019s endowment, run by \nits chief investment officer David Swensen since 1985, has delivered excellent long-term returns and is \nconsidered a pioneer in asset allocation. When Swensen took the helm in the mid-1980s, about 65 percent of \nthe portfolio was allocated to U.S. equities, 15 percent to U.S. bonds, and none to private equity. Today, U.S. \nequities, bonds, and cash are less than 10 percent of the endowment\u2019s target asset allocation.2  \nFurther, companies have raised more money in private markets than in public markets in each year since 2009. \nFor example, companies raised $3.0 trillion in private markets and $1.5 trillion in public markets in 2017.3 These \nchanges in how investors invest and how companies raise capital have important implications for holding \nperiods, the perceived volatility of the returns, and liquidity. \nRegulation and legislation have also played an important role in the evolution of capital markets. A company\u2019s \npropensity to go public can be framed as a cost-benefit analysis, and the costs have risen since the 1990s.4 In \naddition, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, which review mergers, have been \naccommodating for acquirers in recent decades, and many industries have become more concentrated as a \nconsequence.  \nFinally, there is the role of the \u201cinstitutional imperative,\u201d which Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive \nofficer of Berkshire Hathaway, describes as \u201cthe tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of \ntheir peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so.\u201d5 David Swensen wrote a very influential book called \nPioneering Portfolio Management. Yale moved into alternative investments early and as a result generated high \ninvestment returns.6 \nMany other endowments and pension funds have sought to follow suit, shifting their asset allocations away from \na traditional mix of stocks and bonds toward a greater weighting of alternative investments, including buyout and \nventure capital funds. As we will see, there was a substantial benefit to being early and having the ability to find \nskilled managers. \nWe now start our tour by examining where we are today. We focus on U.S. public equities, buyout funds, and \nventure capital funds. We do not cover other important alternative assets, including non-U.S. buyout and venture \ncapital, real estate, private debt, natural resources, and infrastructure. That said, the U.S. asset classes we      \ncover are generally the largest and oldest. Private equity technically refers to both buyout and venture capital \nfunds, but it is common for industry professionals use buyout funds and private equity interchangeably. \n \n \n \n"

As of year-end 2019, there were approximately 3,640 listed companies in the U.S. \nemploying 42 million people, roughly 7,200 firms owned by private equity buyout funds employing 5.4 million, \nand 18,400 companies backed by venture capital firms employing 1.1 million.7 The average market capitalization \nfor a public company today is roughly $10.4 billion, up from about $700 million in 1976, adjusted for inflation.  \nU.S. domestic equity mutual funds manage about $8.4 trillion, with active funds controlling $5.6 trillion and index \nfunds $2.8 trillion, at year-end 2019, according to the Investment Company Institute (ICI). These figures do not \ninclude $4.7 trillion in separately managed accounts. The capitalization of U.S. public equities was approximately \n$38 trillion as of December 31, 2019. \nBuyout funds in the U.S. have $1.4 trillion in AUM as of September 30, 2019. This includes $560 billion in \u201cdry \npowder,\u201d money committed by limited partners but not yet drawn. Because buyout firms acquire companies \nusing a substantial amount of debt, purchasing power is higher than dry powder.  \nVenture capital funds have AUM of approximately $455 billion, which includes dry powder of $120 billion.8 \nNotwithstanding the desire of many large investors to increase their exposure to private equity, the market \ncapacity is substantially smaller than it is in public markets. \nInvestor Flows. Exhibit 1 shows investor flows into U.S. equity mutual funds and equity exchange traded funds \n(ETFs) from 1970 through 2019. Flows followed the market for much of this period: investors purchased equity \nfunds after the market rose and sold after the market fell. In recent years, this relationship has weakened and \nequity funds have seen outflows even when the stock market had attractive returns. For example, investors \nwithdrew $170 billion in 2019 even though the S&P 500 had a total return of 31 percent. \nExhibit 1: Investor Flows into U.S. Equity Mutual Funds and ETFs, 1970-2019 \n \nSource: Investment Company Institute. \nNote: Equity mutual funds (1970-1992), domestic equity mutual funds (1993-2019), and domestic equity ETFs; Mutual fund \ndata is net new cash flow; ETF data is net share issuance. \nThe big story in the U.S. public equity markets is the shift from active to indexed, or rules-based, funds. Exhibit \n2 shows that since 2008, investors have directed $2.0 trillion into index mutual funds and ETFs and more than \n$1.8 trillion out of active funds.9 Investors have shifted their equity allocations from actively-managed equity \nfunds to index funds and private equity. \n-300\n-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nNet  Flows (Billions USD)\n"

What stands out is the \nsubstantial inflow into venture capital in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom. Flows have risen steadily, \nalbeit at a reduced level, since the dot-com bust. Note that we have used the same scale for buyouts and venture \ncapital to make it clear that the venture business is much smaller than the buyout business, which in turn is \nmuch smaller than the public market. One observation that is true for buyout and venture capital is that periods \nof strong investor commitments are generally followed by periods of weak returns.  \nWe now examine investor returns while considering a number of issues. To start, it is important to recognize that \nmeasuring the returns of private equity funds is inherently more difficult than it is for mutual or hedge funds \nbecause the funds only report returns periodically, there is no standard for how to mark to market, and fund \nresults are much more heavily skewed. That said, some general patterns emerge.10 \nRisk and Reward. Exhibit 4 plots the risk, measured as standard deviation, and return for buyout and venture \nfunds along with a number of other asset classes from 1984 through 2015. Standard deviation is a measure of \nhow much the annual returns are spread out. Venture capital funds provided the highest returns and the second-\nhighest risk. Buyout funds generated the second-highest returns and risk in the bottom third of the asset classes. \nLarge capitalization equities, for which the S&P 500 is a good proxy, had lower returns than buyout and venture \nwith risk in the middle of the two. Because there is discretion in how private funds report their returns, some \nacademics have argued that the risk is understated.11  \nExhibit 4: Risk and Reward for Asset Classes, 1984-2015 \n \nSource: Robert S.

Both have \nlimitations. IRR\u2019s most significant flaw is that it assumes investors can reinvest interim cash flows at the IRR, \nwhich is rarely true. Further, funds perform the calculation inconsistently from one another and IRR does not \nrefer to a benchmark. In many cases, IRR overstates returns.12 \nSome fund managers have sought to enhance their IRRs by using subscription lines of credit. Instead of calling \ncapital directly from limited partners, the general partner borrows money from a bank. Shortening the time that \nthe capital of the limited partners is invested boosts the IRR. These lines of credit have gone from a fairly modest \n$150 million in 2014 to about $20 billion in 2019 and increased the annualized IRRs by 2.6 percentage points \nfor the funds that used them.13  \nMOIC and TVPI are absolute measures of return but can be difficult to assess and compare. For example, \ngetting 1.5 times paid-in capital is great over one year but much less attractive over 5 years. Similar to IRR, \nthere is no reference to a benchmark.  \nTo address some of the shortcomings of IRR and MOIC, academics have developed the concept of public \nmarket equivalent (PME), which attempts to make a direct comparison between returns for investors in private \nequity and public markets. PME is generally reflected as a ratio between private equity and public market returns. \nA ratio above 1.0 reveals relative outperformance and below 1.0 means underperformance.14  \nHere\u2019s an example of how PME works. Say a fund drew $200 million from its investors in January 2013 and paid \nout $500 million in December 2017. An investor could have alternatively invested the $200 million in the S&P \n500, which would have returned $416 million over the same period. The PME would be 1.2 ($500/$416). \nAcademics and practitioners often make adjustments for risk to make the returns more comparable.  \nExhibit 5 shows the median and weighted-average PMEs for buyout funds from 1984 through 2015. The most \nrecent figures include funds that have not realized their full returns. The median and weighted average over the \nfull period was about 1.2, and closer to 1.1 considering adjustments for size, sector, and leverage.15 \nExhibit 5: Public Market Equivalent Returns for U.S. Buyout Funds, 1984-2015 \n \n \nSource: Robert S.

The distribution of returns for individual investments is quite distinct for \npublic equities, buyout funds, and venture capital funds. Exhibit 7 examines the multiple on invested capital for \n15,000 global buyout investments and 30,000 global venture capital investments, mostly from the mid-1990s to \n2018. It also shows about 30,000 observations of 5-year returns for stocks in the Russell 1000, generated by \ncollecting thirty increments of 5-year returns from year-end 1985 through year-end 2019. We selected a five-\nyear horizon for public equities because it is roughly in line with the average holding period for private equity.  \nVenture capital has the most investments that lose money but also has more big winners. Buyout funds have \nmore losers than public equity but also have more winners. Only about one-quarter of public stocks lose money \nduring this period, but the skew to the right is more modest than for either venture capital or buyouts.       \n \n \n \n \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\nPublic Market Equivalent (x)\nWeighted \naverage\nMedian\nAverage (median)\nAverage \n(weighted average)\n"

You earn returns much higher than the median if you are invested with \nfunds in the top quintile.17   \nSuch imbalanced returns are nothing new. Tom Nicholas, a professor of business administration at Harvard \nBusiness School, compares venture capital returns to those of whaling voyages and shows that the payoffs are \nvery similar. The amount of oil and whalebone the ship returned to port, which determined the payoff from \nwhaling voyages, was highly variable.18 \nThe general picture that emerges is that buyout funds have added value relative to public market investments, \nalthough the jury is out on the returns of funds raised in recent years.19 The median return for a venture capital \nfund has been unremarkable over the decades, save for the technology boom of the 1990s.20 But investing with \nthe best funds provided consistently attractive PME returns. This leads to the idea of return persistence. \nPersistence. Persistence is strong when the next result has a high and positive correlation with the last result. \nFunds that have done well continue to do well, and funds that have performed poorly continue to underperform.  \nResearch shows that both buyout and venture capital fund returns were persistent prior to 2000. Since 2000, \nhowever, venture capital fund returns have remained persistent while there is less evidence that buyout fund \nreturns have.21 Some scholars attribute the persistence of VC returns to \u201cpreferential access\u201d to subsequent \nattractive investments as the result of better-than-average results with initial investments.22  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0.0-0.5\n0.5-1.0\n1.0-1.5\n1.5-2.0\n2.0-2.5\n2.5-3.0\n3.0-3.5\n3.5-4.0\n4.0-4.5\n4.5-5.0\n5.0-5.5\n5.5-6.0\n6.0-6.5\n6.5-7.0\n7.0-7.5\n7.5-8.0\n8.0-8.5\n8.5-9.0\n9.0-9.5\n9.5-10.0\n>10\nFrequency (Percent)\nMultiple on Invested Capital\nVenture Capital\nBuyouts\nPublic Equities\n"

First, notwithstanding the substantial growth and \npopularity of U.S. buyout and venture capital funds, the public market remains vastly larger. Today, the equity \ncapitalization of the U.S stock market is roughly 27 times the size of the AUM for buyout funds and more than \n80 times the size of venture capital funds.  \nInvestors have been taking money out of public equities in the U.S., with net outflows of about $500 billion from \ndomestic equity mutual funds and ETFs over the past 5 years. (These have been more than offset by \napproximately $3 trillion in company share buybacks.23) But the bigger story is the reallocation of money invested \nin the equity market from actively-managed funds to indexed or rules-based funds, including traditional index \nfunds and ETFs.    \nInvestor commitments to U.S. buyout funds have increased steadily in recent years and in 2019 surpassed the \npeak preceding the financial crisis. Commitments to venture capital funds are also near record levels excluding \nthe extraordinary inflow in 2000, which remains almost twice as large as any other year. Combined, the \ncommitments to U.S. buyout and venture funds were about $315 billion in 2019.  \nIn 40 years through 2019, the S&P 500 Index had a total return of 11.8 percent. Buyout funds came to \nprominence in the late 1980s and have generated attractive public-market equivalent returns since then. That \nsaid, since 2000 the returns appear to be coming down and large capital raises, combined with historically high \nvaluation levels, may portend more modest returns in the future. Further, the persistence of returns has declined \nin recent decades.  \nThe public-market equivalent return for venture capital funds has been uninspiring in the aggregate save for a \nstrong period during the technology boom in the 1990s. In this case, the aggregates belie a meaningful and \npersistent gap between the best and the worst funds.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

These include the nature and desires of \ninvestors, the impact of technology, and legislative change. We examine each in turn. \nInvestors. Analyzing companies and figuring out their value has never been easy, but institutional investors are \nbetter equipped to do it than are individual investors. In 1970, individuals held roughly 75 percent of public \nequities and the institutional investment management industry was nascent (see exhibit 8). For example, we \nestimate that the number of chartered financial analyst (CFA) charterholders per public company increased from \nroughly 1 in 1976 to 27 in 2019. \nThis sophistication brought with it more complexity. Financial innovation, including option pricing models, along \nwith rising computing power and declining computing costs, ushered in a new era of finance. This led to changes \nwithin public markets, including the rise of indexing and the migration from public to private markets.   \nExhibit 8: Shift in U.S. Equity Investors from Individuals to Institutions, 1970-2019 \n \nSource: Federal Reserve. \nNote: Institutional investors include insurance companies, private pension funds, mutual and closed-end funds, and ETFs. \nPerhaps the simplest explanation for the shift from public to private equity is the needs and demands of \ninstitutional investors. For most pension funds and endowments, the primary investors in U.S. private equity, \nliabilities have increased while expected asset returns have decreased. For example, a large gap has opened \nbetween the assets and liabilities for pension funds in the U.S. Estimates for these unfunded pension liabilities \nrun from about $1.6 to $6 trillion, depending on the method and assumptions you use.24     \nThere are three levers to reduce the gap: contribute more to the plan, provide less to the beneficiaries, or \ngenerate a higher return on the assets under management. Since the first two levers are not popular, most chief \ninvestment officers strive for the third.          \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nPercentage Ownership of Corporate Equities\nInstitutions\nIndividuals\n"

Since then, it has mostly \nbeen on a one-way slide to a recent low of 1.2 percent. The standard way to estimate expected returns in finance \nis to start with a risk-free rate (usually the yield of a Treasury bill, note, or bond) and add a risk premium. The \nprinciple is that the riskier an asset is the higher its expected return. If you want more return, you have to seek \nmore risk.   \nConsistent with this, recent research shows that one of the best predictors of buyout activity is the risk premium.25 \nThe evidence suggests that total buyout activity is high when the aggregate risk premium is low. This fits with \nthe idea that investors in buyout funds seek higher returns when the risk premium, and hence the expected \nreturn, is low. \nExhibit 9 shows the assumed rate of return on pension assets for the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement \nSystem (CalPERS) along with the yields on 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities from 1961 through 2020. \nCalPERS had about $350 billion in assets as of late 2019. The assumed return in 1962, at 4 percent, was about \nequal to the yield on the Treasury note. Through the early 1980s, the plan\u2019s assumed rate of return was \nconsistently below the yield on Treasury securities.  \nBy 1992, the assumed return had drifted up to 8.75 percent and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was \nabout 7.75 percent, which meant the fund only had to earn a risk premium of about 1 percentage point to satisfy \nits return objective. \nAt the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year, the assumed return is a more modest 7 percent but the yield on the 30-\nyear Treasury bond is 1.4 percent, implying a risk premium of 5.6 percentage points. The chief investment \nofficers of pensions and endowments, and the boards that serve the beneficiaries, have little choice but to seek \nrisk in order to generate higher returns. For example, in June 2020, CalPERS announced that it would add \nleverage of up to 20 percent of fund value, or $80 billion, in order to increase the portfolio\u2019s expected risk and \nreward.26 Historically, buyout and venture capital funds have helped meet the demand for returns. \nExhibit 9: CalPERS\u2019s Assumed Rate of Return and Yields on Treasury Securities, 1961-2020 \n \nSource: CalPERS; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.); and FactSet. \nNote: Assumed returns and Treasury yields reflect CalPERS\u2019s June 30 fiscal year. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n1960\n1962\n1964\n1966\n1968\n1970\n1972\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\nPercent\n10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield\n30-Year U.S. Treasury Yield\nAssumed Return\n"

The payout \nfrom the endowment provides 30 percent or more of the operating revenues for a number of leading institutions.27 \nFor example, Yale\u2019s endowment funded 10 percent of the operating budget in 1985 and contributes 35 percent \ntoday.28 \nThe vast majority of endowments have a spending guideline, and most use a moving average rule that sets the \npayout at a pre-specified percentage of average assets over a number of years.29 Many endowments have \nassumed that a payout figure of five percent is sustainable.30  \nThe endowments must try to meet the needs of their institutions in the face of lower expected returns. One way \nto do this is to assume more risk, and a higher asset allocation to private equity is one attempt to solve the \nproblem. Buyout funds, as well as hedge funds, are also an indirect way to lever returns. \nThe pattern in asset allocation that we have seen is consistent with the search for returns.

First, they can offer high returns. This is \nbased on two premises. One is that limited partners (investors) can identify skillful general partners (fund \nmanagers) who have the ability to deliver attractive results. The other is that there is a return premium for owning \nilliquid assets. Second, alternative assets can improve the profile of a portfolio if the returns have a low \ncorrelation with the other assets in the portfolio. In other words, alternatives can provide diversification benefits.   \nReturn dispersion, the difference between the best and worst funds, is very wide in private equity relative to \nother asset classes. Venture capital dispersion is higher than that of buyouts, but both are high. That means the \nability to identify and gain access to skillful general partners is crucial. Research shows that skill in fund selection \nis a significant determinant of returns and that access to the best managers was key to the success of \nendowments such as Stanford and MIT. The leaders have done better than the followers.35 \nLiquidity measures the ability to turn an asset into cash or cash into an asset. High liquidity means the cost is \nsmall and low liquidity means the cost is high. As such, investors demand a higher return for owning an asset \nthat is illiquid, or an \u201cilliquidity premium.\u201d Financial economists have documented this premium empirically.36    \nAn institution that seeks to harvest the illiquidity premium can run into trouble when it must meet a sudden \ndemand for liquidity. We saw this in 2008-2009. For instance, the Harvard endowment put up for sale almost 40 \npercent of its private equity portfolio in the midst of the financial crisis.37 Other long-term managers, including \nthe Stanford endowment and CalPERS, found themselves in a similar liquidity crunch.38  \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\nAsset Allocation\nState and Local Government Pensions\nAlternative Assets\nFixed Income and Cash\nPublic Equities\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\nAsset Allocation\nEndowments\nAlternative Assets\nFixed Income and Cash\nPublic Equities\n"

The question is how much of that \nbenefit is the consequence of truly uncorrelated returns rather than the smoothing of returns. Investment \nmanagers have some discretion in marking the value of the companies in their portfolios, making them seem \nless volatile than their public-market counterparts.  \nA number of financial economists who have studied this issue conclude that the economic exposure of private \nequity funds is similar to that of public markets.39 If true, this analysis suggests that returns are consistent with \nrisk and that the diversification benefits are not as great as generally perceived.40 \nThis is where psychology comes into play. Private equity funds do two things that may benefit investor returns.41 \nFirst, the capital is locked up for a period of time, which limits the ability to buy high and sell low. Second, the \nsmoothed returns provide a perception of stability that may offset the tendency to overreact to short-term losses.  \nRemarkably, the chief investment officer of CalPERS, Yu Ben Meng, cited the delayed and discretionary \nvaluations as a benefit, suggesting they provide a source of \u201ctime diversification.\u201d42 Private equity may add value \nby allowing the funds to stick to their investment policies.  \nIf you had to pick the intellectual home of the efficient market hypothesis and the rational economic actor, the \nUniversity of Chicago would be a reasonable choice. The University of Chicago\u2019s endowment, like many others, \nincreased its weighting in alternative assets prior to the financial crisis. And it had difficulties similar to other \nfunds when the crisis hit.  \nAndrew Alper, then chairman of the university\u2019s board of trustees and a member of the investment committee, \nput it bluntly: \u201cWe had underestimated the value of liquidity and overestimated our degree of diversification.\u201d43  \nIn a world of rising education costs and greater longevity, investors are seeking higher returns to satisfy their \nswelling liabilities. Pension funds and endowments have increasingly turned to private equity in an effort to \ngenerate the returns they need. While there may be a reasonable debate about whether private equity will \noutperform public equity, there is little doubt that fixed income investments offer historically low returns. Investors \nneed to cast a wide net in order to build a portfolio that serves its purpose. \nTechnology. Corporate governance of public companies remains a hot topic with open questions, including the \npurpose of the corporation, what role shareholders should play (especially with the rise of indexing), performance \nmeasurement, and executive pay.44 These are worthy debates.  \nCompared to public companies, private companies held by buyout or venture capital firms have boards that are \nmuch smaller, more sophisticated, and have more skin in the game. Buyout and venture capital firms are \ninvolved with risky businesses. For buyouts, the risk is from financial leverage. For venture capital, it is from the \nuncertainty of new businesses. The companies are in different stages of their lifecycle, but both have an \nexposure to a form of risk. \nWe now examine three considerations that are relevant for the multi-decade shift from public to private firms, as \nwell as the composition of the firms that remain public.     \nThe first is the rise of intangible assets. Paul Romer, an economist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in \n2018 for his work on endogenous growth theory, poses a basic question: \u201cHow can it be that we\u2019re wealthier \ntoday than people were 100 years ago?\u201d The underlying quantity of raw materials has not changed over time. \nThe answer is we can now arrange resources in ways that are more valuable than before. \n"

Robert Solow, also a Nobel Laureate, created a model that made technology endogenous. Romer\u2019s \ncontribution was to make technology \u201cpartially excludable,\u201d or a private good.45 This allows firms to benefit from \ntheir investments.  \nRomer emphasizes the importance of intangible assets, including instructions, formulas, recipes, and methods \nof doing things. He argues that \u201cgrowth takes place when companies and individuals discover and implement \nthese formulas and recipes.\u201d46  \nWhat\u2019s important is that these intangible assets have characteristics that are different from physical capital or \nlabor. Economists call them \u201cnon-rival\u201d goods, which means that more than one person can use the good at a \ntime. A physical book is a rival good that only one person can read at a time. A digital book is a non-rival good \nthat can be read by many simultaneously. Under certain conditions, intangible-based companies can defy the \nconventional economic concept of diminishing marginal returns and in fact realize increasing returns.47   \nExhibit 12 shows how the mix of tangible and intangible investments has changed over the last 40 years. In the \nlate 1970s tangible investments were nearly double those of intangible investments. Today, intangible \ninvestments are one-and-a-half times larger than tangible investments. A watershed change in the form of \ninvestment has occurred over a couple of generations. \nExhibit 12: The Rise of Intangible Investments in the U.S., 1977-2017 \n \nSource: Unpublished update to Corrado and Hulten (2010) using methods and sources developed in Corrado and Hao \n(2013) and in Corrado et al. (2016) and Corrado et al. (2017) for INTAN-Invest\u00a9 and the SPINTAN project, respectively. \nThe SPINTAN project was funded by the European Commission FP-7 grant agreement 612774. \nNote: Investment as a percentage of gross value added for the business sector. \nThis shift has a few implications for our discussion. To begin, companies need less capital because they need \nfewer physical assets.48 For example, sales per employee for Facebook, Inc. were nearly double those of Ford \nMotor Company in 2019. From 1956 to 1976 the number of public companies grew fivefold, as many companies \nneeded to finance \u201ctheir mass production and mass distribution.\u201d49 Today, companies simply do not require as \nmuch capital as they once did. This, along with freer access to private capital, allows private companies to \nremain private longer. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\nInvestment as a Percentage of \nGross Value Added\nIntangible\nTangible\n"

About 1,500 companies went public \nduring the 1970s, 3,000 in the 1980s, 3,900 in the 1990s, and 2,100 in the 2000s. Companies that had listed \nbefore 1970 had a 92 percent probability of surviving the next five years, and those listed in the 2000s had a \nprobability of only 63 percent. The chance of survival has dropped in each successive decade.50 The main \nreason companies delist is that they are acquired. This contributes to the last implication. \nIn corporate America, the strong are getting stronger. This is giving rise to \u201csuperstar\u201d firms.51 For example, the \ngap in return on invested capital between a U.S. company in the top 10 percent and the median has risen sharply \nin recent decades.52 Consolidation explains a large part of this. Measures of concentration, such as the \nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index, have shown a substantial increase for many industries since the mid-1990s. These \ninclude industries that rely on tangible assets.53   \nWhen the proper conditions are in place, certain businesses exhibit increasing returns, which include very high \nmarket shares and economic profits. Increasing returns are pronounced in intangible-based businesses, and \nthere has been a growing gap between the intangible spending of the large firms relative to small ones.54   \nThe shift from tangible to intangible assets has had a meaningful effect on the mix between public and private \ncompanies. That many young companies have less capital intensity means they don\u2019t need to go public to raise \ncapital. The mix of the companies that are public has shifted to more reliance on intangible investment, which in \nturn has led to a reduction in longevity. And the economics of information goods, combined with the concentration \nof traditional industries and the outsourcing of low-value-added activities, means that a handful of leading \ncompanies earn much higher economic rents than their competitors and businesses of the past.  \nThe second consideration is the social and economic backdrop as well as the structure of the financial markets. \nThis has had a large impact on the buyout industry. \nIn 1989, Michael Jensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, wrote a provocative article called \u201cEclipse of \nthe Public Corporation.\u201d55 Jensen suggested that managers, or agents, were too misaligned with the \nshareholders, or principals. He argued that corporate structures, such as leveraged buyouts, would effectively \ndeal with the principal-agent problem by aligning managers and shareholders, especially in mature industries \nwhere there was a risk of misallocating free cash flow. There were about 5,800 public companies in the U.S. at \nthe time he wrote that paper, and today there are roughly 3,600. \nWhile Jensen\u2019s case seems prescient, there are a few caveats. One is that the capacity and time horizon of the \nbuyout industry is limited by structure. Another is that public companies can take steps to allocate capital more \njudiciously and align the incentives of managers and owners. Finally, Jensen\u2019s concept works better with \nbusinesses based on tangible assets than it does with those built on intangible assets. Despite these limitations, \nJensen\u2019s argument set the stage for the buyout industry by identifying the weaknesses of public companies.56   \nAnother driver of the buyout industry was the development of the high yield bond market in the 1980s and 1990s \nand the leveraged loan market since the turn of the 21st century. Debt outstanding in the high-yield bond market \nwas $24 billion in 1977 and grew to more than $200 billion in 1990, or from 4 to 25 percent of all corporate debt. \nIn particular, the high-yield market nearly doubled from 1986 to 1989, reflecting the late 1980s buyout wave and \nthe peak prominence of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the largest dealer in the business.  \nThe high yield market retreated in the early 1990s after the demise of Drexel and the savings and loan crisis, \nonly to resume growth in the mid-1990s. Access to this debt financing was vital to the buyout industry in the \n1980s and 1990s. The high yield market grew steadily through 2007, even as buyout volume surged. The \nfinancial crisis briefly halted growth, but the size again increased until hitting a plateau in 2016 (see exhibit 13).  \n"

One central feature in this link is the rapid growth of the market for collateralized debt obligations \n(CDOs).58  \nInvestment banks create CDOs by pooling debt instruments that generate cash and packaging the stream of \ncash flows into tranches based on different levels of credit risk. For example, the triple-A tranches will receive \nthe cash flows from the pool of debt instruments first, making the securities relatively safe. The equity tranche \nreceives cash flows only after all of the more senior tranches are paid.   \nCollateralized loan obligations (CLOs), a form of CDO backed by corporate loans, have played an important role \nin fueling the buyout business. CLOs have gone from 0.1 percent of the leveraged loan market in 1994 to about \n60 percent today.59 Over that time, CLOs have grown from less than $1 billion to nearly $700 billion (see exhibit \n15). The primary buyers of leveraged loans include CLOs, insurance companies, and loan, hedge, and high-\nyield funds. The largest buyers of CLOs are banks, insurance companies, and funds. \nExhibit 15: U.S. Collateralized Loan Obligation Market, 2000-2020 \n \nSource: Eric Yu, \u201cHY Credit Chartbook,\u201d BofA Global Research, April 2, 2020. \nNote: Principal amount; through February 29, 2020. \nA few drivers may explain the growth of the leveraged loan market relative to the high-yield market.

Further, demand has been strong from CLOs.  \nFrom the point of view of the issuers, one feature of the leveraged loan market is the opportunity to get terms \nwith less onerous covenants, which are essentially financial metrics that the company must maintain in order to \nhelp protect investors.

This discouraged the levering of corporate balance \nsheets. In recent decades, most European countries have included provisions for reorganization.63  \nThe structure and interplay between finance and business is often the residue of legal tradition. Buyouts first \ngained traction in countries where common law prevailed, for example the United States and United Kingdom, \nand were slow to grow in countries guided by civil law such as France, Germany, and Japan.64  \nThe buyout industry in the U.S. grew over the decades as the result of a declining risk premium, a legal system \nthat allowed for failure without existential costs, and innovation in financial markets, including CLOs. \nThe final consideration, essential for venture capital, is what drives \u201cnational innovation capacity\u201d for a country. \nThe professors who developed the framework define national innovative capacity as \u201cthe ability of a country to \nproduce and commercialize a flow of innovative technology over the long term.\u201d65 There are three main \ndeterminants of this capacity. \nThe first is the strength of a nation\u2019s \u201ccommon innovation infrastructure.\u201d This reflects the country\u2019s policies on \nscience and technology, means to support basic research and advancements in academia, and the size of the \nstock of technological know-how. This idea is closely related to endogenous growth theory. This has been a \nstrength of the U.S., especially because of its top-flight universities. That there are strong venture capital \ntraditions in Boston and the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, is not a coincidence as these geographies \nare homes to elite academic institutions, including Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and the University of California, \nBerkeley.66     \nThe next is the \u201cinnovation environments\u201d in a nation\u2019s industrial clusters. Michael Porter, a professor of business \neconomics and one of the authors of the work on national innovation capacity, wrote about the factors that \nsupport these environments in his book, The Competitive Advantage of Nations.67 These include the availability \nof high-quality scientists and engineers who are specialized, a competitive environment that is intense and \nrewards success, strong and exacting domestic demand for the goods and services produced, and the \nconnection between related industries so as to capture knowledge spillovers.   \nThe final determinant of national innovation capacity is the quality of the link between infrastructure and clusters. \nNational innovation is effective when the infrastructure generates conceptual building blocks and ideas and \nclusters effectively commercialize products and services. Venture capital plays a vital role in financing \ninnovation, including openness to failure without stigma.68  \nThe U.S. has consistently ranked among the top of all nations in innovative capacity.69 The venture capital \nindustry has both benefitted from this capacity and been a vital contributor to it. \n"

There have been a number of key regulations that have had a meaningful impact on the public \nmarket for equities in the U.S. These include rules that protected investors and promoted industry growth. Major \nlegislation that looked out for investors includes the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which established the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC\u2019s goal is to \nprotect investors, and the 1940 Act addressed past abuses and specified rules for the investment industry. \nLegislation that spurred the industry included the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), \nwhich sharply increased the allowable contributions into retirement plans. It also permitted investments in mutual \nfunds for plans that had been previously prohibited from doing so and established individual retirement accounts \n(IRAs) for workers not covered by their employer\u2019s plan.  \nERISA also established what has become known as the \u201cprudent person rule,\u201d the principle that a fund\u2019s assets \nshould be managed with the care and conservatism of a prudent person. But because the rule did not have a \nclear definition, many pension fund managers of institutional capital stuck to public and liquid investments.  \nLegislation has also played a meaningful role in the development of the buyout and venture capital industries. \nExhibit 16 highlights some of the most important changes based on legislation from over the past 60 years. Most \nof these legislative acts reduced the friction for investors to allocate capital to private equity. The most significant \nof these include the following:   \n\u2022 The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 allowed for the creation of small business investment \ncompanies that were licensed and regulated with the explicit intent of funding new and early-stage \nbusinesses.  \n\u2022 The guidelines for the prudent man rule were clarified in 1979. These included the idea that a manager \ncould consider diversification as part of an assessment of prudence. As a consequence, private and illiquid \ninvestments were suddenly acceptable. That elucidation \u201cflung the door open for corporate pension funds \nto invest in private capital.\u201d70    \n\u2022 Cuts in the capital gains tax rate enacted through the 1978 Revenue Act and the Economic Recovery Tax \nAct of 1981 were associated with an increase in investor commitments to venture capital.  \n\u2022 The relaxing of certain securities laws, most notably through the National Securities Markets Improvement \nAct of 1996, allowed late-stage private startups to access a greater supply of private capital that enabled \nthem to reach a size that was rare before that capital was available.71 \n\u2022 The Pension Protection Act of 2006 relaxed a limit ERISA imposed on private funds that said that benefit \nplans could not make up more than 25 percent of assets. The new law expanded the types of investors \nthat do not count against the total.    \n\u2022 In a June 2020 information letter, the Department of Labor said defined contribution plans can offer private \nequity as an investment option while remaining in compliance with ERISA. Defined benefit plans have \nlong invested in private equity, but defined contribution plans have avoided it largely due to fears of \nlitigation. \nWe now turn to the background and major developments in U.S. public equity markets, the buyout industry, and \nthe venture capital industry. We start with public equities. \n \n"

Researchers who have built regression models based on GDP, population, and governance \nsuggest that there should be roughly 5,800 to 12,200 more public stocks than there are, a large listing gap.73 \nOther academics suggest that the number of companies is the wrong way to think about the vibrancy of the \nstock market or the prospects for economic growth. Rather, they argue that the correct metric is the movement \nof corporate assets. This requires understanding transactions between companies, including public to public, \npublic to private, and private to public.74 For example, if a public company acquires another public company, the \nnominal listing is cut from two to one, but the real-asset method keeps the count at two. Likewise, the real-asset \nmethod counts a public company acquiring a private one as a doubling.  \nBy this reckoning, the reduction in assets since the 1990s is less than five percent, putting to rest concerns about \nthe competitiveness and completeness of the U.S. equity market. Public companies buying one another creates \nthe sense of reduction even as the assets remain in the public sphere. And a public company acquiring a private \none puts those assets in the public markets, just not via an IPO.  \nThree economists, Craig Doidge, Andrew Karolyi, and Ren\u00e9 Stulz, have done the most-cited work on the listing \ngap. They seek to explain the number of listed companies as the product of the propensity to list and the \npopulation of firms that are candidates for listing.75 Their research suggests that there have been changes with \nboth the propensity and the population. \nWe can distill the propensity to list into an analysis of cost and benefit. The cost of listing includes fees for listing \non an exchange, regulatory requirements, expenses related to mandatory disclosure, the competitive risk of \nrevealing information useful for competitors, and investor relations. In addition, executives may feel the burden \nof delivering short-term results, having a higher profile in the media, and subjecting themselves to the scrutiny \nand potential action of activist investors. Many of these costs are fixed and have been on the rise.  \nThe benefits of listing are the ability to raise funds for internal uses or acquisitions, liquidity, proper price \ndiscovery, and analyst coverage. Netting these costs and benefits, Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz estimate that the \npropensity to list is roughly one-half of what it was in the mid-1990s.76     \nEconomists who have studied the decline in the number of listed companies have also converged toward the \nview that the required size to list has risen in recent decades. Part of the reason is the increase in fixed costs \nassociated with listing. Notably, seemingly obvious culprits, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which set \nor expanded disclosure requirements for the boards, management, and accounting firms of public companies in \nthe U.S., did not appear to play a central role in these growing costs.   \nOne important driver is the \u201csmall size trap,\u201d which states that it is now harder for small companies to become \nlarge. For example, in the 1990s somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of small companies became medium \nor large companies each year. That percentage is now one-half of what it used to be. This in turn reflects a \nprofitability gap. The difference between the median return on assets for large and small companies was 15 \npercentage points in the 1990s and is now in the range of 30-35 percentage points.77  \n"

So, a small company captures \nmore value by selling to a big company than by doing an IPO and remaining independent as a public company. \nThis basic sketch, if correct, predicts a reduction in the number of IPOs, an increase in mergers and acquisitions \n(M&A), and an increase in the average size of a public company. We have seen all three. \nExhibit 19 shows IPOs from 1976 through 2019. There is a general uptrend from the mid-1970s through the mid-\n1990s, followed by a decline through the present. There were 282 IPOs per year on average from 1976 through \n2000 and 115 from 2001 through 2019. Also consistent with the thesis, companies that listed in recent decades \nare on average older and larger than those of the prior period.  \nExhibit 19: Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in the U.S., 1976-2019 \n \nSource: Jay R. Ritter, see https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/ipo-data/. \nNote: Data for all years exclude SPACs, IPOs with an offer price below $5.00, ADRs, unit offers, closed-end funds, REITs, \nnatural resource limited partnerships, small best efforts offers, and companies not promptly listed on the New York Stock \nExchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, or the American Stock Exchange (currently NYSE MKT); Data for 1980-2019 also \nexclude IPOs from banks and savings and loans. \nDirect listings have garnered a great deal of attention recently. With a direct listing, a company creates no new \nshares, existing holders offer their shares, and there are no underwriters. Enthusiasts point out that companies \ncan get the benefits of being public without the cost of underwriting and other common frictions such as lockups. \nFor example, IPOs of companies backed by venture capital firms from mid-2009 through mid-2019 saw an \naverage price increase of 21 percent on their first day of trading, suggesting sellers left substantial profits on the \ntable. For now, however, only a tiny percentage of new listings are direct.79  \nExhibit 20 shows the reasons why stocks of companies are delisted. A voluntary delisting is the least common \nexplanation. This is the case when a company decides the cost of being public outstrips the benefit and is \nconsistent with the thesis that the size threshold of listing has been on the rise. The stocks of some of these \ncompanies continue to trade but are not registered with an exchange.   \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n1976\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nNumber\n"

For instance, the HHI is 2,500 for a stock \nmarket with 5 stocks and weightings of 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, and 0.05 (10,000 * [0.352 + 0.252 + 0.202 + 0.152 \n+0.052]). The higher the HHI, the more concentrated the market.  \nExhibit 24 shows the HHI for the Russell 1000 index from 1985 through 2019. An equal-weighted index would \nhave an HHI of 10.

As a result of where \nthey are in the industry lifecycle and the profitability they enjoy, listed companies also have a high proclivity to \npay out capital.82 Following the introduction of a safe harbor provision for buying back stock in 1982, the preferred \nmeans to return capital to shareholders has shifted from dividends to share buybacks.  \nSecond, buyout and venture capital funds have not included many Main Street investors. This could change with \nthe Department of Labor\u2019s instruction letter, written in 2020, that may allow private equity as an option for defined \ncontribution plans.

He gave up his trucking \nbusiness to get into shipping. Waterman was an attractive target. It had 37 ships, $20 million in cash, no debt, \nand a price tag of $42 million. McLean borrowed that sum from National City Bank, used Waterman\u2019s cash to \npay off nearly half the loan, and owned the business after having put up only $10,000 of his own money. Walter \nWriston, who would later become chairman and CEO of Citicorp, was the young banker who worked with McLean \nand said, \u201cIn a sense, Waterman was the first LBO.\u201d90 \nAbout a decade later, a group at Bear Stearns, led by Jerome Kohlberg and eventually aided by young \ncolleagues Henry Kravis and George Roberts, started doing \u201cbootstrap deals.\u201d These involved buying \nestablished companies with predictable cash flows using mostly borrowed money. The first was the acquisition \nof Stern Metals in 1965 for $9.5 million, funded with $8 million in debt. The Stern family put up some equity and \ncontinued to run the company. \nThe success of the LBO business within Bear Stearns led to some internal friction, encouraging the group to \nleave the firm and start Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in May 1976.91 A slew of other firms opened their doors \naround the same time, including Thomas H.

Only about 10 percent \nof funds charge less than 20 percent for the profit share, or carried interest, component of fees.  \nIn reality, the effective fees that sophisticated investors pay is less than the headline figures because they have \naccess to co-investments. A co-investment is when a limited partner makes an investment alongside a buyout \nfund or venture capital firm. The fees on these investments are lower or, in some cases, nonexistent. That said, \nthe sticker price for fees has remained remarkably resilient.93 One study of buyout funds found that management \nfees are more than one-half of total fees.94  \nHistorically, more than 95 percent of buyout deals have been small capitalization, at or below $1.1 billion in \nenterprise value, and done at statistically cheap valuations.95 These deals would fall into Eugene Fama and \nKenneth French\u2019s categories of small capitalization and value.96 For this reason, small cap value indexes have \nbeen a reasonable benchmark for calculating the public market equivalent returns of buyout funds in the past. \nBut as capital has flowed to the buyout industry, there has been an increase in the size of the deals and the \nvaluation at which the deals are happening based on enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA). Exhibit 27 shows the average size of deals from 1980 to 2019. \nBefore 2005, deals were consistently in the small capitalization range. That said, one of the most careful studies \nof the relationship between transaction size and returns found that large deals in the U.S. did as well, if not \nbetter, than mid-market deals.97 \nThere are high-profile exceptions to the theme of small deals, including KKR\u2019s purchase of RJR Nabisco in 1988, \nbut those deals are unusual. Deal sizes increased going into the financial crisis of 2008-2009, with four deals \nexceeding $25 billion in 2006 and 2007. Following the financial crisis, deal size has steadily risen. \nExhibit 27: Average Size of U.S. Buyout Deals, 1980-2019 \n \nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence and Evan Kershaw Rose \u201cThe Principal Agent Problem, Asymmetric Information \nand Leveraged Buyouts: How Who Does the Buying Affects Who Gets Bought,\u201d Honors Thesis, University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, April 1, 2011. \n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nAverage Size (Millions USD)\n"

First, the average multiple has risen \nsteadily since the financial crisis. The EV/EBITDA multiple for 2019, 11.5, was the highest ever recorded, and \n55 percent of all deals in the U.S. had a purchase price that was greater than 11 times. Analysis by one buyout \nfirm found more than one-half of the deals it did at an EV/EBITDA multiple in excess of 10 lost money and that \nin aggregate the high-multiple deals returned only slightly more to investors than what the firm invested.98 \nSecond, buyout deals had multiples below those of public markets for most of the 1990s and 2000s but have \nsince converged. Exhibit 28 shows the median EV/EBITDA for buyouts and the S&P 500 since 1990. Buyouts \nhave drifted from their roots as transactions focused on small capitalization and value stocks. For example, \nbuyouts of software firms, a sector with above-average multiples, rose from 6 to 17 percent of all deals over the \npast decade.99 \nExhibit 28: Median EV/EBITDA for U.S. Buyout Deals and S&P 500, 1990-2019  \n \nSource: FactSet; S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Ulf Axelson, Tim Jenkinson, Per Str\u00f6mberg, and Michael S. \nWeisbach, \u201cBorrow Cheap, Buy High?

Think of it this way. Say you have a target company that generates $200 in EBITDA. Assuming a \npurchase price of 8 times EV/EBITDA and debt/EBITDA of 6 times, the equity contribution would be 25 percent \nof the purchase price ($1,600 purchase price = $1,200 debt + $400 equity). The same business and leverage \nlevel at a 12 times EV/EBITDA multiple would require 50 percent in equity ($2,400 purchase price = $1,200 debt \n+ $1,200 equity). \nExhibit 31 shows that the average equity contribution to U.S. buyout deals from 1997 to 2019 has ranged from \n30-50 percent. High equity contributions make the economics even more reliant on multiple expansion upon exit.  \nExhibit 31: Average Equity Contribution to U.S. Buyouts Deals, 1987-2019 \n \nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence. \nExits. Investment returns ultimately depend on a successful exit. The average holding period was more than 7 \nyears in the 1970s and early 1980s, drifted lower to a trough of 4 years in 2008, and has gradually risen again \nto about 5.5 years in 2019.101 There is also evidence that some buyout firms add value by timing their entry and \nexit. Buyout firms have been able to sell businesses at an EV/EBITDA multiple that is consistently higher than \nthe purchase price.102  \nThe form of exit has also changed substantially over the decades. In the 1970s and 1980s, a sale to another \ncompany, called a \u201cstrategic\u201d buyer, represented about 33 percent of exits, and IPOs were another 25 percent. \nSales to another buyout or financial firm, called a \u201cfinancial\u201d buyer, were less than 15 percent of exits. These \ndeals are also called secondary buyouts.  \nIn recent decades, sales to strategic buyers have remained fairly steady. But secondary buyouts, as exhibit 32 \nshows, have grown significantly as a share of exits and are now a majority. Exits via IPO have dwindled. Since \nthe 1990s, the buyout industry has grown faster than the overall equity market, buyout firms have recycled \ncapital by trading companies among themselves more frequently, and the number of IPOs has shriveled.103 \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nAverage Equity Contribution (Percent)\n"

For example, a buyout firm\u2019s \nresults are persistent if its first and second funds both generate excess returns. Persistence is a good measure \nof skill because it captures repeated success or failure. There is a large literature on persistence in the \ninvestment management industry because it is a potential way to identify skillful managers.104  \nThere is a general consensus that buyout funds were persistent prior to 2000 but that persistence has declined \nsince then.105 This is consistent with an industry that has grown and become more competitive.

Measured as points of PME, the difference has gone \nfrom about 0.75 in the 1990s to 0.25 today. Tim Jenkinson, a professor of finance at the University of Oxford \nand one of the leading researchers in the field, said, \u201cTop decile is the new top quartile.\u201d107 \nThis is an example of what we call the \u201cparadox of skill,\u201d which says that even as absolute skill among \ncompetitors increases, relative skill often decreases and the difference between the best and the average \nshrinks. The paradox of skill is observable in many domains, including sports, business, and investing.108 \nPart of the explanation for the paradox of skill is that many more new funds are raised on the record of top \nquartile funds than bottom quartile funds. So the best increasingly compete against one another and the worst \ndo not participate in subsequent funds. Despite the fact that it has shrunk, return dispersion in buyouts remains \nhigher than lots of other asset classes, including equity mutual funds. \nOne clear trend in fundraising is that more of the capital is going to fewer firms, which means that limited partners \nare being more selective and are increasingly investing alongside the bigger buyout firms. For example, in 2019 \nthere was a 14 percent decline in the number of buyout funds raised but an 80 percent increase in fund size.109 \nIn the U.S. alone, six funds raised more than $10 billion each in 2019.110 \nOverall, small funds tend to outperform large funds. One study shows that the larger the current fund is relative \nto the previous fund, the lower the IRR relative to the first fund. For instance, a new fund that is double the size \nof the prior fund has an expected IRR that is four percentage points lower. The author does not argue that larger \nfund size causes the lower returns but rather that the results reflect regression toward the mean.111 We would \nadd only that regression to the mean occurs rapidly when luck plays a large role in shaping outcomes. \nOutlook. The outlook for returns from U.S. buyouts relies on assumptions about the multiples paid to buy \nbusinesses, the amount of leverage used, the potential to improve operations, the multiple received upon exit, \nand fees.112 The main argument for muted returns in the future is the recent trend in multiples paid. As Exhibit \n34 shows, there has historically been a clear correlation between the entry multiple and PME. Low deal multiples \nare associated with high PMEs and high multiples with low PMEs. Another analysis that considered these trends \nprojects buyout returns to be 300-400 basis points lower going forward compared to the 25 years ended in 2018. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Investors include venture capital funds and venture arms of corporations. Investments include startups, \nearly-stage, and emerging companies. Historically, a majority of venture investments have lost money, but large \ngains by a few successful investments have allowed the industry to generate positive returns.113 \nForms of venture capital have been around for centuries. For example, the U.S. whaling industry, which peaked \naround 1850, had many of the characteristics of modern venture capital. Whaling involved high-risk and high-\nreward ventures that had a pattern of payoffs that would be familiar to any contemporary venture capitalist.114     \nOrigins. In the early part of the 20th century, startups were funded largely by wealthy families and individuals. \nToday, we would call them \u201cangel\u201d investors. Examples include firms such as Pan American World Airways, \nEastman Kodak, and Ford Motor Company. Many of the early venture capital firms, then called \u201cinvestment \ndevelopment companies,\u201d were founded by monied and prominent familes, including Rockefeller Brothers, Inc. \n(1946), T. Mellon & Sons (1946), and J. H. Whitney & Company (1946).115  The story is that the term \u201cventure \ncapital\u201d was first used in a conversation between Jock Whitney and Benno C. Schmidt Sr., the co-founders of J. \nH. Whitney & Company, in 1946.116 \nThe formation of American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) is often associated with the birth of \nthe venture capital industry as we know it today. Founded in Boston, Massachusets by prominent bankers, \nacademics, and businessmen, ARD raised $3.5 million for a closed-end fund in the fall of 1946, with more than \none-half coming from institutional investors. Many early deals were due to affiliations with MIT and Harvard.  \nOne of the founders of ARD was General Georges Doriot, then a professor at Harvard Business School. He \ntaught a course called Manufacturing that was really \u201call about starting companies and technology.\u201d117 A number \nof his students and disciples went on to be prominent venture capitalists, including Tom Perkins (Kleiner \nPerkins), Don Valentine (Sequoia), Bill Elfers (Greylock Partners), Arthur Rock and Dick Karmlich (Arthur Rock \n& Company), and Bill Draper and Pitch Johnson (Draper & Johnson Investment).    \nDespite some positive press, ARD bumped along for decades until in 1957 it made its most famous investment: \na 70 percent stake in Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for about $70,000. ARD\u2019s stake in DEC grew more \nthan 50-fold by 1971, and ARD was sold to Textron in 1972. ARD\u2019s return from inception to sale was 14.7 percent \nand would have been half as high without the investment in DEC.118   \nThe passing of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 was another key moment in the history of venture \ncapital. The act enabled the formation of small business investment companies (SBICs) that allowed for licensed \nand regulated pools of capital for the express intent of investing in new and early-stage businesses. The \ngovernment provided inexpensive capital that the SBICs could lever four-to-one.  \nThe act opened the floodgates for enterprising financiers. By 1962 there were 590 licensed SBICs, and the \nnumber swelled to 722 in 1964. In the early 1960s, SBICs accounted for three-quarters of venture capital \ninvestments.119 But nearly one-third of these ended up as problematic, and regulations were put in place to limit \nthe number of SBICs. By the late 1970s, just one in every five dollars of venture capital in the U.S. was \nattributable to an SBIC, and that figure dropped to below one in every ten dollars by the late 1980s. \nThe IPO market was hot in the late 1960s, allowing for some attractive exits.120 In 1967, there were 100 IPOs \nthat enjoyed an average first-day gain of 38 percent. The IPO market gained momentum in 1968, with 368 deals \nand a one-day pop of 56 percent. The peak was 1969, when there were 780 IPOs. But the first-day returns \n"

To put this in perspective, the IPOs in 1969 \nalone equal 20 percent of the total number of public companies today.121   \nThe popping of the IPO bubble, the reduction in the number of SBICs, and the bear market of 1973 combined \nto slow the venture capital industry substantially for most of the 1970s. While capital commitments to the industry \nexceeded $200 milion in 1969, flows were $50 million or less until 1978. Instiutional investors were wary of the \nreturns, liquidity, and appropriateness of the asset class.  \nA slew of legistation, including the 1978 Revenue Act, the 1979 \u201cPrudent Man\u201d rule, the 1980 Small Business \nInvestment Incentive Act, and the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act, revitalized the venture capital industry (see \nexhibit 16). These laws lowered capital gains taxes, reduced regulation, and made venture capital more \nattractive for institutional investors. \nCapital flows roared back into the industry in the 1980s. Within a decade after 1978, the number of venture \ncapital firms more than tripled, investment in capital grew 8 times, and the number of funded companies rose \nmore than 4.5 times.122 The hub of the industry shifted to the San Francisco Bay Area, where it remains today. \nMore than one-half of U.S. venture capital\u2019s AUM are based in the Bay Area, and that figure rises to almost \nthree-quarters if you include Boston and New York City.123  \nThis success was intimately related to the development of new technologies, including the personal computer \nand biotechnology, and a cadre of firms known for underwriting technology deals that included Alex Brown & \nSons and Hambrecht & Quist. As with the 1960s, however, the flow of capital led to substandard returns and a \ngeneral retrenchment into the early 1990s. Flows in the early 1990s returned to an anemic state. \nThe venture capital industry then went through its greatest period ever starting in the mid-1990s. This was in \npart fueled by the adoption of the Internet, ushered in by the meteoric rise of Netscape, an Internet browser, \nfollowing its IPO in August 1995. By the end of 2000, one of every five publicly-traded companies was venture-\nbacked, and those companies represented about one-third of the equity market\u2019s capitalization.124   \nThe dot-com bust, along with a three-year bear market, again tempered enthusiam for the asset class. \nCommitments in 2003 were nearly one-tenth of those in 2000. But the industry once again climbed out of the \nlull. Commitments in 2007 were nearly triple those of the 2003 level, only to again fall as a consequence of the \ngreat financial crisis. The trend in commitments has been steadily higher since 2010. There are about 1,300 \nventure capital firms in the U.S. today.    \nPublic markets, buyouts, and venture capital are all cyclical, but venture is the most cyclical of the three.125 This \nin part reflects price discovery, correction mechanisms, and liquidity. Public markets are subject to bouts of \nexcessive optimism and pessimism, but in general price discovery and liquidity function well.  \nBuyouts are of companies that are generally profitable and somewhat predictable. They also commonly have \npublic market comparables that can guide price discovery. Venture involves young firms with unknown \nprospects. There are fewer correction mechanisms in venture than in public markets. A limiting factor is the time \nbetween capital commitment and return of capital.

The management fee is typically 2 percent \nof the total amount raised by the fund, and the incentive fee is commonly 20 percent of profits. But venture \ncapital and buyouts differ in their ability to scale. In buyouts, doing large deals is not materially different than \nsmall deals. As a result, buyout firms can grow their AUM with less degradation of expected returns than can \nventure firms.  \nVenture capital firms focus on relatively young and immature companies, and part of the value proposition is \nhelping entrepreneurs build their businesses. This activity does not scale as well as buyouts do.128  \nExits. The return for any fund is a function of the difference between the purchase and subsequent sale of \ninvestments. From the beginning of the venture industry through the mid-1990s, an IPO was the most common \nway to profitably exit a venture investment.129 In the late 1990s through 2000, both IPOs and a sale of the \nbusiness were popular. But since 2000, IPOs have declined substantially, and a sale, either to a strategic buyer \nor a buyout fund, has become the preferred vehicle for exit (see exhibit 37).  \nNote that roughly 60-65 percent of venture investments end up with a \u201cmultiple of invested capital\u201d of less than \n1.0, and 25-35 percent fail.

Young companies today don\u2019t need to raise capital from the \npublic market because they are generally less capital intensive than their predecessors. For example, companies \nthat did an IPO in the 1970s had lower gross margins, selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs, and \nresearch and development (R&D) expenses than those that went public in the 2000s. They also had higher \ncapital expenditures as a percentage of sales.132  \nThird, even those companies that are in very competitive industries have been able to stay private because \nthere is a huge amount of capital available via late-stage funds. The basic story is that initial funding comes from \nventure capital firms that invest in companies in the early stages, and companies continue to raise rounds of \nfinancing backed by funds that invest in later stages. The key is that the valuations for companies tend to rise \nwith progressive rounds, creating the appearance of wealth creation without a tangible price that a sale or stock \nprice provides. \nDoorDash, a food delivery company, is a good example of the process. Its first formal round of venture capital, \nSeries A, was $17 million, which valued the company at $72 million. Since then the company has raised $2.4 \nbillion in 7 rounds. The latest round was $400 million and implied a value of $16 billion.133 This amount of capital \nallows the beneficiaries to spend a lot of money away from the scrutiny that public markets impose. DoorDash \nis reported to have lost $450 million in 2019.134 \nFinally, there are now ways for employees who are compensated in equity to sell shares. In some cases, funding \nrounds give employees a chance to cash out. For example, Airbnb, Inc. raised an $850 million round that allowed \nemployees with sufficient tenure to sell $200 million worth of stock.135 In addition, a number of marketplaces, \nincluding SharesPost, Forge, EquityZen, NASDAQ Private Market, ClearList, and Carta, provide liquidity for \nsellers and buyers. About one-half of private companies surveyed allow their employees to sell shares.136 \nThese drivers have important consequences for investors. \nThere is now a sizeable population of companies that are very valuable on paper. For example, CB Insights, a \nplatform that tracks market intelligence in the technology industry, counts 225 \u201cunicorns\u201d in the U.S. worth a \ncombined $662 billion as of July 2020.137 A unicorn is a young company \u201cvalued at $1 billion [or more] by private \nor public markets.\u201d138 It is often the case that a relatively thin slice of investment raises the presumed value of \nthe entire enterprise.  \nNaturally, entrepreneurs seek to build valuable companies, and venture capitalists want to find companies that \nwill deliver high returns on investment. But there are many reasons to be cautious about the headline figures. \nTo begin, there are now numerous examples of companies that have not lived up to their high valuations. These \ninclude Theranos (which peaked at $9 billion and later dissolved) and WeWork (which went from $47 billion to \n$8 billion in 2019). Raising a substantial amount of capital implying a high valuation does not by itself confer \nsuccess. \nPrice discovery is stunted in private markets, as only optimists invest and there is no mechanism for pessimists \nto express their view. The sunlight of an IPO can be the best of disinfectants from overvaluation and can improve \nproductivity.139 From 2011 through 2019, about one-third of the companies that went public had a valuation \nbelow that implied by the final round of private financing.140 \nIn a survey published in 2020, more than 90 percent of venture capitalists said unicorns were overvalued and a \nmajority of them thought they were \u201csignificantly\u201d overvalued. Forty percent of those who were surveyed said \n"

But complicated capital structures are the main reason \nthat many headline valuations are overstated. The method most investors use to value a business is to take the \nprice paid for the last round of shares and multiply it by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if \na startup with 8,000,000 shares raises $200 million by selling 2,000,000 shares at $100 each, the \u201cpost-money\u201d \nvalue of the company is now deemed to be $1,000,000,000 (10,000,000 x $100), reaching unicorn status. \nThis math is misleading because the equity financing rounds commonly have different rights with regard to cash \nflows and downside protection. Unlike the common stock of most public companies where all shareholders have \nessentially the same rights, the classes of equity in startups can vary greatly from one another. These differences \ninclude IPO return guarantees, vetoes over IPOs at a price lower than the current round, or capital structure \nseniority. Academics who studied unicorn valuations found eight share classes per company on average. \nThese professors analyzed the financial terms from legal filings and found that reported post-money valuations \nfor unicorns are roughly 50 percent above fair value on average, and for about 10 percent of their sample the \nvaluation was double fair value. Nearly one-half of the 135 companies in their sample lost unicorn status after \nthey made all of the appropriate adjustments.142  \nAnother consequence of staying private longer is that more wealth is created in the private market and less in \nthe public market. While individuals are ultimately the beneficiary of the private wealth creation through pension \nfunds or endowments that invest in venture capital funds, a normal individual investor is largely shut out from \nthat source of wealth. \nExhibit 40 shows the time from founding to IPO and the market capitalization at IPO for Amazon.com, Google, \nFacebook, and Uber. Amazon, which was backed by the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, came public 3 \nyears after it was founded with a market capitalization of $660 million (in today\u2019s dollars). Investors who bought \nat the IPO and held their shares have made more than 1,800 times their money through June 30, 2020.  \nGoogle did an IPO 6 years after its start, and shareholders have made 33 times their money. Facebook went \npublic 8 years following its founding with a market capitalization of $117 billion. Shareholders have made 6 times \ntheir money. Uber went public 10 years after founding with an initial market capitalization of $75 billion.  \nVirtually none of the $1.3 trillion in value that Amazon built was in the private market. Three percent of the value \ncreated by Alphabet, which controls Google, was in the private market, and that percentage was about 17 \npercent for Facebook. And the implied value of Uber in the private market was more than 100 percent of the \ntotal value created, as the company\u2019s market capitalization is below what its IPO price implied.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

At the same time, it has \nbecome more common for entrepreneurs and investors to consider a sale to a special purpose acquisition \ncompany (SPAC) or a direct listing as alternatives to a traditional IPO.143 \nIn a customary process for an IPO, an issuer selects an underwriter that helps with regulatory issues, marketing, \npricing, and post-deal price stabilization. Underwriters also generally have an overallotment option (commonly \ncalled a \u201cgreenshoe\u201d). In return, the issuer pays an underwriting fee, typically 4-7 percent based on the size of \nthe IPO, and agrees to a lockup that prevents certain shareholders from selling for a specified time, usually 90 \nto 180 days. It is common for venture capital funds to hold their shares well beyond the IPO and lockup, so they \nhave an interest in seeing a company continue to thrive.144 \nA SPAC is a company that goes public with the goal of using the offering proceeds to make an acquisition. In \nan IPO, a SPAC offers a unit that includes a common share at a set price and warrants. SPACs are sometimes \nreferred to as \u201cblank-check\u201d companies and can provide public market investors access to private companies. \nBecause a deal involves negotiation only between the SPAC and the target, the transaction tends to be more \nstraightforward, sure, and transparent. \nWith a direct listing, a stock exchange builds an order book, whereby buyers and sellers express their interests \nin terms of price and volume. The exchanges do this every day for every stock. The opening price reflects the \nintersection of supply and demand. Buyers include any investor, and sellers include shareholders, such as \nemployees and early-stage investors. Neither buyer nor seller has an obligation to transact.  \nIdeally, the process of going public should meet the standards of market-based price discovery and equal access \nfor investors.

First, they are relatively expensive. Beyond underwriting fees, regulatory and legal \ncosts can add up to another two percent of the offering proceeds.145 Second, it is also common for underwriters \nto price IPOs at a discount. In the ten years ended 2019, the average return for an IPO on the first day was 17 \npercent.

For example, in 1980 \naround 10 percent of investments were late stage. By 2006, roughly 20 percent of dollars went to investments \nof $50 million or more, and that figure was closer to 60 percent in 2019.150 The capacity for early-stage \ninvestments is much smaller than that for late-stage investments. This has important implications for risk and \nreturns. \nMany investors look to alternative investments, and venture capital in particular, to deliver high returns. But the \nrisk and reward is very different for early- versus late-stage venture. Early-stage venture has a very high failure \nrate, and a few investments create all of the attractive expected returns. Late-stage venture has a failure rate \none-half as high as early-stage, but the expected returns are commensurately lower.151       \nThis puts fund size into clear focus. Contrast two well-known venture capital firms, Benchmark Capital and the \nventure arm of SoftBank Group. In 2020, Benchmark is seeking to raise $425 million for its tenth fund, a size \nsimilar to its three prior funds.152 SoftBank, through its Vision Fund, raised $100 billion in 2017. Softbank \nreportedly invested $14 billion in WeWork, $7.7 billion into Uber, and $5 billion into Oyo Rooms.153 Deploying \nthat much capital in relatively immature companies and achieving a high return on investment is difficult.  \nWe saw that the expected returns were lower for large buyout funds that followed smaller funds. The same is \ntrue for venture capital, but the effect is even more pronounced.154  \nOne important feature of venture capital is the persistence of returns. We saw that the persistence of returns for \ntop-performing buyout funds waned in the 2000s versus prior decades.  \nThis is not true of venture capital, where persistence remains high. Exhibit 42 shows that a top quartile fund had \nnearly a fifty percent likelihood of being followed by another top quartile fund. This was true before 2001, as \nshown in the left panel, and after 2000, as shown in the right panel. We would expect a 25 percent probability \nof the returns staying in the same quartile if the outcomes were dictated by chance.  \nExhibit 42: Persistence for Venture Capital Funds \n \n \n \nSource: Robert S.

The dispersion of returns within the asset class \nsuggests that investors who have access to top tier funds will continue to earn very attractve returns. It also \nstands to reason that the large swell of investment in late-stage venture will earn lower returns than the smaller \nsum invested in early stage.  \n \n \n \n \n \n-40%\n-30%\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\nVenture\nCapital\nBuyout\nLong/Short Equity\nHedge Funds\nLarge Cap Equity\nMutual Funds\nSmall Cap Equity\nMutual Funds\nTaxable Bond\nMutual Funds\nDispersion from the Median\nPercentiles\n95th\n75th\n25th\n5th\n"

Considerations include potential \nasset growth, industry capacity, valuation, competition, and fees. \nBuyout and venture capital funds continue to have good potential for asset growth. Exhibit 44 shows one way to \nthink about the opportunity.156 U.S. investors, including individuals, pension funds, insurance companies, and \nendowments, owned about $31 trillion of equity at year-end 2019. Add non-U.S. investors and the equity \nownership grows to nearly $39 trillion.  \nExhibit 44: What A One Percent Shift in U.S. Equity Holdings Implies for Private Equity AUM \nInvestors \nValue of U.S. Equity \nHoldings ($B) \nPrivate Equity AUM Change \nwith 1% Shift from Public to \nPrivate Equity ($B) \nU.S. Households and nonprofit organizations \n21,076 \n211 \nU.S. Pension funds \n6,281 \n63 \nU.S. Insurance companies and non-financial business \n3,366 \n34 \nForeign \n8,179 \n82 \nTotal \n38,902 \n389 \n \nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \nNote: As of December 31, 2019. \nThe question is whether investors will continue to allocate assets to private equity. There appears to be continued \nappetite to do so. For example, nearly one-half of institutional investors in North America surveyed by BlackRock, \nan investment management firm, said they intended to increase their allocation to private equity \u201cslightly\u201d or \n\u201csignificantly.\u201d157 Forty percent of endowments and foundations plan to invest more money in private equity.158  \nFollowing a June 2020 letter from the Department of Labor, individual investors may now have a greater \nopportunity to invest in private equity through their retirement plans. The Department of Labor said defined \ncontribution plans can offer private equity as an investment option while remaining in compliance with ERISA. \nDefined benefit plans have long invested in private equity, but defined contribution plans have avoided it largely \ndue to fears of litigation. The SEC is also examining ways to make private investments more accessible to \nindividual investors.159 \nAs exhibit 43 suggests, every 1 percent shift in asset allocation from public to private equities represents about \n$390 billion in assets. For context, the commitment to U.S. buyouts and venture capital were approximately $315 \nbillion in 2019.  \nThe primary reason investors look to allocate more money to buyouts and venture capital is because they expect \nthe returns to be higher than in public markets. In a recent survey of institutional investors, 88 percent said they \nhad target annual returns for private equity of 8 percent or more, and 40 percent had target returns of 14 percent \nor more.160 A survey of private equity general partners in 2012 revealed that nearly 90 percent of them marketed \ninternal rates of return of 15 to 30 percent to their prospective limited partners.161 While that figure is surely lower \ntoday, limited partners perceive private equity to remain an important source of high returns.   \nPart of the justification for the belief in higher returns comes from the fact that the ratio of value created in the \nprivate markets, relative to that of the public markets, has increased versus what we saw decades ago.

These can confer advantages in \nbehavior by compelling a long-term orientation.    \nInvestors may want to allocate more of their portfolios to buyout and venture capital funds, but that desire has \nto be balanced against the industry\u2019s capacity. Ultimately, capacity reflects the set of opportunities and the cost \nto monetize them. One way to measure effective capacity is through the concept of wealth maximization. One \nmeasure of wealth maximization is excess return adjusted for risk, or alpha, times AUM. For example, a fund \nthat generates 2 percentage points of alpha on $1 billion of capital creates $20 million in wealth ($20,000,000 = \n.02 * $1,000,000,000). \nIn most cases, expected alpha declines as AUM grows. This makes sense because as AUM grows the \nopportunity set shrinks. In theory, a fund that is managed with skill will expand its AUM to the point that expected \nalpha approaches zero. Because investors anticipate that buyout and venture capital funds will earn returns in \nexcess of public markets, it makes sense to enhance the concept of capacity with a threshold of positive alpha.162 \nIn other words, capacity equals how big a fund can get while still generating expected alpha of one or two \npercentage points per year.    \nOne way to look at the issue for buyouts is to consider commitments to the asset class divided by market \ncapitalization. The average commitment level was just under \u00bd of 1 percent of the market from 1980-2019, and \nexperience shows that PMEs are poor when the ratio substantially exceeds that amount, as it did in the late \n1980s and mid-2000s (see exhibit 45).  \nExhibit 45: Commitments to U.S. Buyout Funds as a Percent of Market Cap, 1980-2019 \n \nSource: NVCA 2010 Yearbook; PitchBook; World Bank; and Center for Research in Security Prices. \nNote: 1980-2005 data includes commitments to mezzanine capital. \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nCommitments (Percent of Market Capitalization)\n"

High multiples are consistent with competition for \nassets. While there is likely industry capacity, especially when considering investment opportunities outside the \nU.S., these factors suggest that buyout funds will find it challenging to generate compelling PMEs. \nBoth buyouts and venture capital are cyclical, but venture capital is the more cyclical of the two. The mismatch \nbetween supply and demand of venture capital explains much of this.163 Supply is a function of the willingness \nof investors to commit capital. This inclination to invest can be the result of the relaxation of regulatory barriers \nand is in theory supposed to reflect expected returns. In reality, flows often mirror past returns. Investors do in \nthe present what they should have done years before. \nDemand is a function of how many entrepreneurs have good ideas. Demand shocks often come with important \ntechnological changes, including the semiconductor industry, personal computer hardware and software, \nbiotechnology, the Internet, mobile, and cloud computing. Investing in start-ups is a very labor-intensive business \nfor venture firms. And even with the introduction of new technologies, the number of talented entrepreneurs is \nlimited. \nThe trend toward later-stage investing in the venture industry suggests that the capacity for start-up investing is \nlimited. This industry had $120 billion in dry powder at the end of 2019, which is 2.4 times the capital raised \nduring the year. There is likely very limited capacity for investments in the first, or Series A, round of venture \ncapital. Late-stage equity may have more capacity but investors should have more muted expectations for \nreturns.  \nStrong flows into the industry combined with high levels of dry powder mean that buyout and venture funds have \na lot of pressure to put capital to work. This has had an impact on valuation. As we have seen, valuations have \ntrended higher in both the buyout and venture industries.  \nIn buyouts, the most common measure of valuation is the EV/EBITDA multiple.164 While at record levels, the \nheadline multiple needs to be considered in the context of interest rates that stand at a generational low. That \nsaid, a substantial percentage of the return for buyout funds in recent years has come from the ability to exit at \na multiple higher than that at entry. A flattening or degradation of multiples will further pressure returns. \nIn venture capital, valuation is trickier because the capital recipients are often young, unproven companies that \nare commonly in the stage of the corporate lifecycle where they lose money.165 But the sizeable sums that have \ngone into these companies, the large number of companies claiming unicorn status, and the uneven \nperformance of unicorns as they go public suggest valuations are full.166 \nCompetition is also a crucial consideration. This starts with the competition buyout and venture capital funds \nface in buying businesses. Buyout firms compete with one another as well as with strategic buyers and even \npublic market investors. Venture capitalists compete to find the next big company. Offsetting this to some extent \nis the fact that buyout and venture capital firms commonly co-invest. Still, identifying and acquiring attractive \nassets is a challenging task, and the recent rise in valuations suggests that it is not becoming easier. \nWe also see that firms are more willing to enter into one another\u2019s markets. As we noted before, buyout funds \nused to primarily acquire stable and cheap small-capitalization companies. Deal sizes today include companies \nthat have better growth prospects but are also larger and more expensive. Venture capital firms used to focus \nmostly on start-ups, but now they invest in more mature growth companies. One important finding is that buyout \nfirms tend to generate worse returns in funds that drift from their original style.167    \n"

For example, Two Sigma Investments, a \nquantitative hedge fund, raised a fund through a new venture capital division called Two Sigma Ventures. The \ngoal is to leverage \u201cits parent company\u2019s network of 1,700 data scientists, engineers and industry experts to \nsupport development inside its portfolio.\u201d168 \nAnother entrant is the investment management behemoth Vanguard Group, which managed $6.2 trillion in early \n2020. Vanguard is partnering with HarbourVest, which has been in the private equity business since the early \n1980s.169 Vanguard will offer private equity products to institutionally-advised clients early on, but hopes to \nbroaden accessibility of the asset class to more of its clients over time. Vanguard\u2019s growth in index funds has \nput pressure on fees for actively-managed mutual funds. It remains to be seen what its move into private equity \nportends for fees there. \nCompetitive pressure is not restricted to the general partners of private equity firms but also extends to the \ninvestors, or limited partners, in the funds. Gaining access to leading funds is tough as the funds are commonly \noversubscribed or completely closed to new investors. One potential solution is funds of funds, which have \nperformed well in venture capital.170 Combine high dispersion of returns with a lack of access and it is easy to \nsee why many investors in private equity may be too optimistic about the returns they will earn. \nVanguard looms large on the fee front, but many large institutional investors already mitigate fee pressure \nthrough co-investments and direct investments. Direct investments are relevant for sophisticated institutions that \nare large enough to develop the necessary investing expertise and portfolio diversification without having to hire \na fund. Recent research shows that institutional investors earn gross returns on their co-investments that are \nsimilar to the returns they earn in funds.171 \nThe timing of general partner compensation also appears to be a relevant factor in determining returns for \nventure capital funds. Returns for limited partners are higher before and after fees when the agreement is to pay \ngeneral partners on each deal rather than deferring carried interest until the fund has reached a benchmark \nreturn.172 \nAs with most corners of the investment world, there will be pressure on fees for many buyout and venture capital \nfirms.173 Similar to active managers of public equities, firms that demonstrate skill will be able to charge above-\naverage fees. But investors will likely challenge the lower tier of the industry to lower fees. \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 80-82 \n \n \n \n \n"

There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. \nPortfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the \nPortfolio will decline and that the value of Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. \nMarket values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, \nterrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to \npredict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Equities securities\u2019 \nvalues also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Privately placed and restricted securities \nmay be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, which will increase their \nilliquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk). Alternative investments \nare speculative and include a high degree of risk. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their \ninvestment. Alternative investments are suitable only for long-term investors willing to forego liquidity and put \ncapital at risk for an indefinite period of time. Alternative investments are typically highly illiquid \u2013 there is no \nsecondary market for these private funds, and there may be restrictions on redemptions or assigning or \notherwise transferring investments into private funds. Alternative investment funds often engage in leverage and \nother speculative practices that may increase volatility and risk of loss. Alternative investments typically have \nhigher fees and expenses than other investment vehicles, and such fees and expenses will lower returns \nachieved by investors. \n \nDISTRIBUTION \nThis communication is only intended for and will only be distributed to persons resident in jurisdictions where \nsuch distribution or availability would not be contrary to local laws or regulations. \n \nIreland: Morgan Stanley Investment Management (Ireland) Limited.
