Investors need to determine whether or not current and prospective customers add \nvalue. The only way to understand customer economics is to break down the analysis into its prime components. \nCall them the leading indicators of customer value, which ultimately drive shareholder value. \n \nUnfortunately, very few companies\u2014even subscription companies\u2014measure customer value well, and the \nmetrics they do calculate and share don\u2019t always tell the whole story. As a result, the necessary analytical inputs \nare not always readily available. Further, the current accounting system does a very poor job of revealing the \ndifference between a good and bad customer. \n \nFor example, consider two companies with the same number of customers, revenue per customer, expected net \ncustomer growth, and customer acquisition costs. Which company is more valuable? \n \nMost businesspeople intuitively assume these companies have the same value. In fact, the businesses may have \nradically different values based on the customer lifecycle at each firm. In general, research shows that companies \nthat have significant customer loyalty are generally more profitable, and hence more valuable, than companies \nthat do not. 3  \n \nThis customer-focused approach leads us to the following definition of value:  \n \nValue of a business = value per customer x number of current and future customers \n \nIn different words, business value is a function of customer economics and the current and future users (market \nsize). This equation is simple, but unpacking the essential elements is not.  \n \nFurther, companies often create incentives that encourage employees to behave in ways that diminish aggregate \ncustomer value. For example, a company might pay sales representatives based on how many new customers \nthey sign up without considering the quality of those customers (i.e., likelihood to leave the service, \ncreditworthiness, etc.). The company could inadvertently take on net present value negative customers.   \n \nThis report offers a framework to analyze businesses through the customer-value lens. In particular, we will cover \nfour areas. First we discuss in detail the drivers of value per customer, including customer cash flows, loyalty, and \nacquisition costs. Next we look at ways to size the potential market.  We then look at the issues in managing the \ncurrent customer base. Finally, we point to some deficiencies in our accounting system for evaluating customer-\nbased businesses.  \n \nExhibit 1 shows a partial list of businesses where analysis of customer economics is important. \n \nExhibit 1: Customer Economics Businesses \nWireless communications \nSatellite radio \nSatellite television \nCable television (analog and digital) \nBroadband communications \nCredit cards \nHome security \nMagazines \nLife insurance \nInternet retailers \nOnline brokerage  \nGaming \nVideo rental \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n"

Drivers of Customer Value: It\u2019s All about NPV \n \nFirst principles in finance suggest we use the net present value (NPV) rule to analyze a customer\u2014the same rule \nwe use to judge any financial investment. Customer value is the difference between the present value of the cash \nflows a customer generates over his or her lifetime and the cost to acquire the customer. For instance, a company \nthat expects $500 in lifetime cash flow from a customer who cost $300 to acquire adds $200 to its value.4    \n \nCustomer NPV = PV of lifetime customer cash flows \u2013 acquisition costs  \n \nThough conceptually very straightforward, the devil of customer value is truly in the details. The realities that lurk \nbehind high level terms that the financial community freely slings around\u2014churn, gross adds, net adds, and \naverage revenue per user\u2014are often quite complex.  We\u2019ll start by considering the factors that determine \ncustomer cash flows.  \n \nWe can disaggregate the present value of lifetime customer cash flows into two main parts: how much cash a \ncustomer pays per period and how many periods a customer pays. Customer longevity is often associated with \nloyalty.  \n \nPV of lifetime cash flows = cash flow per period x number of periods \n \nLet\u2019s start with cash flow per period.  \n \nCash Flow per Period \n \nGenerally, the ability to assess the regularity of customer cash flows is a function of the type of relationship. A \npredetermined billing arrangement with the customer\u2014examples include cable, satellite TV, utilities, credit \ncards\u2014often creates steadier and more predictable cash flow streams. 5 This effect is most pronounced with \nsubscription agreements. In addition, companies that charge monthly often have good data on customer behavior \npatterns because of the relatively short feedback loop.  \n \nIn contrast, predicting customer cash flows is much more difficult for transaction-oriented businesses like catalog \nand Internet retailers. These businesses typically comprise a mix of few active customers and many inactive \ncustomers. Determining customer value for a non-subscription transaction business is inherently more difficult \nthan for businesses with more formal or regular customer interaction. 6   \n \nWhen investors think of customer cash flow per period, they generally focus on revenue. But cash flow is the \ndifference between revenues and costs (including investments). As a result, a company\u2019s cost structure can \ndetermine the attractiveness of an incremental customer.  \n \nSome industries have a relatively high upfront, or preproduction, costs, which are costs (or investments) a \ncompany must bear before it can go to market. For example, a company offering satellite television must launch \nsatellites in advance of signing up any customers. Businesses with large preproduction costs tend to have \nsubstantial operating leverage. That is, beyond a \u201cbreakeven\u201d number, incremental customers tend to be very \nprofitable. 7 \n \nHigh preproduction cost businesses often have a lumpy pattern of investment spending: they need to make \nperiodic, large investments to keep up with demand or to remain technologically competitive. In contrast, some \nindustries have relatively low preproduction costs, which mean that the economics tend to be consistent across \nthe customer base.  \n \nAnother important issue in judging customer lifetime cash flow is a consideration of the additional goods or \nservices a business can offer as it matures. One example is bundling, where a single provider offers additional \nservices. Bundling also lowers churn. For example, cable television companies started with analog cable and in \nrecent years added digital cable, broadband, and telephony. According to a cable industry spokesperson, \n\u201cBundles are where cable\u2019s priorities are.\u201d 8 \n \n"

Indeed, the company\u2019s \nelectronics sales recently eclipsed its book sales for the first time. Option theory offers one way to consider and \nvalue a company\u2019s ability to extend its offerings to existing customers.  \n \nNaturally, we cannot model future customer cash flows in a void; we must recognize the role of competition. The \nnumber of competitors and how they compete are two important variables. Lots of competition generally drives \nreturns on capital toward the cost of capital; lower customer prices often drive this economic parity.  \n \nThe nature of competition also affects customer economics. More cooperative industries allow for attractive \ncustomer lifetime values and industry-wide returns. Concepts from game theory help judge industry cooperation. \n \nHow the Demand-Side Affects Cash Flow \n \nWhile competition focuses on how effectively companies can supply a good or service, analysts must also \nconsider the demand side of the equation: How well does a good or service satisfy the customer? There are two \ndynamics at play. \n \nThe first is network effects, which exist when the value of a good or service increases as more people use that \ngood or service. An excellent current example is eBay. As the site draws more buyers and sellers, its value \nincreases for current and prospective buyers and sellers. Strong network effects increase a customer\u2019s \nwillingness-to-pay, and hence can help drive customer lifetime value. 9  \n \nNextel\u2019s push-to-talk technology provides a good illustration of network effects and is an important source of \ndifferentiation for the company. Though not among the three largest wireless providers, Nextel has the highest \naverage revenue per user in the industry (see Exhibit 2).  \n \nExhibit 2: Average Revenue per User for Wireless Telephones \nCompany          ARPU \nNextel \n          $ 69 \nSprint PCS  \n62 \nT-Mobile  \n55 \nVerizon \n \n52 \nCingular  \n50 \nSource: Company published data. \n \nSecond is the idea of overshot markets. According to Professor Clayton Christensen, products and services tend \nto improve along a trajectory that has a steeper slope than that of customer needs. Eventually, the product \nbecomes too good for the mainstream market\u2014it overshoots. You know a product has overshot the market when \ncustomers stop paying for additional features or when customers only use a fraction of the features available. Per-\ncustomer revenues are unlikely to grow in overshot markets. 10  \n \nFurthermore, overshot markets become susceptible to disruptive innovations\u2014new products that are typically \ncheaper, inferior, and easier to use. When a consumer-based business gets disrupted, customer lifetime values \ntend to plummet. One example in recent years is the airline industry, where value migrated from large, full service \ncarriers to low-cost, no-frills carriers. \n \nNow let\u2019s turn to number of periods, which reflects customer longevity. Related concepts include retention rate, \nchurn rate, and customer loyalty.  \n  \n"

A churn rate represents how many customers a company loses \nwithin a given period. If a company with 100 customers loses 15 during a period, it has 15 percent churn. Exhibit 3 \nshows recent monthly churn statistics for various companies. The lower a company\u2019s churn, the higher its \ncustomer retention and longer its average customer tenure. Customer loyalty normally results in low churn rates.11  \n \nExhibit 3: Churn Statistics for Selected Companies \n(Monthly churn for the quarter ended 6/30/04) \n \nCompany  \n \n \nChurn \nXM Satellite Radio \n \n1.1 % \nDirecTV  \n \n \n1.4 \nVerizon Wireless  \n \n1.4 \nNextel Communications \n \n1.6 \n \nEchostar  \n \n \n1.7 \nSirius Radio \n \n \n2.1 \nSprint \n \n \n \n2.3 \nCox (basic video)  \n \n2.6 \nCox (digital video)  \n \n4.4 \nNetflix \n \n \n \n5.6 \nSource: Company published data. \n \nHere\u2019s an example of how loyalty can add value.

In his seminal book, The Loyalty Effect, Fred Reichheld \nshows that a 5 percentage point improvement in retention rate (a reduction in churn) increases customer NPVs \nmore than 75 percent for a host of industries including advertising agencies, auto insurance, credit cards, life \ninsurance, and publishing. 12  \n \nReichheld argues that at least two forces significantly boost value. First, companies that retain customers at a \nhigher rate either spend less money acquiring new customers than other companies with similar customer growth, \nor grow faster than other companies with comparable customer acquisition spending but higher churn. For this \nreason, two companies with the same net subscriber growth, revenue per subscriber, and subscriber acquisition \ncosts can have radically different values.  \n \nHe calls the second force the \u201cprofit-per-customer effect.\u201d 13 He argues that the profits from a customer often grow \nas they stay with the company. Drivers of these enhanced profits include: \n \n\u2022 \nHigher revenues. In many industries, customer spending tends to increase over time. This growth \nreflects a greater appreciation of the product line, increased customer buying power, and comfort \nwith the purchasing format. The cable companies and Internet retailers are examples. \n\u2022 \nCost savings. As customers learn about a business, they require less and less help. This is \nparticularly true for industries that rely on technology to deliver their goods or services. Expense \ntends to decline as customers understand how the technology works, what products the company \noffers, and how to get the information they need efficiently.  \n\u2022 \nPrice premium. Loyal customers often pay higher prices for goods or services. This is because new \ncustomers often come in with price promotion. Also, established customers greatly value the \nservice and may be willing to pay a higher price.  \n \nReichheld\u2019s recent work suggests one metric as the best proxy for customer loyalty and growth: the number of \n\u201cnet promoters.\u201d According to Reichheld, \u201cthe percentage of customers who were enthusiastic enough to refer a \nfriend or colleague\u2014perhaps the strongest sign of customer loyalty\u2014correlated directly with differences in growth \nrates among competitors.\u201d 14 He provides empirical support for this statement from the airline, Internet service \nprovider, and car rental industries.     \n \nDisaggregating Customer Behavior \n \nWhat factors shape customer churn?  A good place to start is customer lock-in and the associated switching \ncosts. Lock-in creates costs that customers must bear in order to switch to a competing offering. Exhibit 5 shows \nvarious forms of lock-in and their associated switching costs.  \n \nExhibit 5: Lock-in and Associated Switching Costs  \n \nType of Lock-In  \n \nSwitching Cost \nContractual commitments  \nCompensatory or liquidated damages \nBrand-specific training \n \nLearning a new system \nSearch costs \n \n \nCombined buyer and seller search costs \nLoyalty programs  \n \nAny lost benefits from incumbent supplier \nNetwork effects \n \n \nReduced interaction with network members \nMonopoly  \n \n \nNon-consumption \nProduct bundles  \n \nMore bills, higher price \nLow cost offering  \n \nHigher price \nSource: Carl Shapiro and Hal R.

For years, wireless carriers fought against WNP, concerned that it would increase churn. In fact, churn did \nnot go up for the national carriers following WNP. A couple of the possible explanations, proactive customer \nservice initiatives and pricing, are mild forms of lock-in (better prices elsewhere remains the number one reason \n"

Other factors relate directly to lock-in, including the greater use of bundling and more and \nlonger contracts. 15   \n \nCommitment to everyday low prices, which derives from a company\u2019s business model, offers another powerful \nform of lock-in. For example, over the years Wal\u2022Mart has consistently passed on some of its scale advantage to \nits customers in the form of lower prices. The company\u2019s motto, \u201cAlways low prices. Always.\u201d effectively \ncommunicates the low-cost pledge. Other companies employing this strategy include Home Depot and \nAmazon.com. The cost advantage lock-in we describe must be for goods and services familiar to consumers. \n \nSegmenting Spenders \n \nAs Reichheld\u2019s analysis suggests, customers tend to spend more the longer they stick with a good or service. \nNaturally, however, customers do not behave uniformly. In an attempt to better understand customer behavior, \nMcKinsey researchers studied how the spending patterns of customers change. They argue \u201cmany more \ncustomers change their behavior than defect, so the former typically account for larger changes in value.\u201d In fact, \nthe cost to save a current customer is often substantially less than the cost to acquire a new one. 16 \n \nTo quantify these effects, researchers developed two broad customer segments: loyalists, who maintain or \nincrease their spending and downward migrators, who spend less over time for a host of reasons. They further \nrefine the segments into sub-segments (e.g., emotive loyalists, lifestyle downward migrators).  While the vast \nmajority of customers are considered loyalists, consistent with Reichheld\u2019s argument, the ratio of loyalists to \ndownward migrators varies by industry. Understanding of a company\u2019s customer loyalty profile can indicate which \ntactics will most likely create value and how a company should prioritize its resources.   \n \nTaking Churn with a Grain of Salt \n \nToday, more companies report churn data than ever before. Still, comparing churn rates across industries, and \noften within industries, can be tricky. There are a few reasons for this:  \n \n\u2022 Average versus actual cohort behavior. Churn statistics are averages, which often belie the pattern of \ncohort behavior. Specifically, for most customer-oriented businesses churn in the initial periods tends \nto be much higher than the lifetime average. (See Exhibit 6.) As a result, customer half-lives are \ngenerally much shorter than the average churn numbers suggest. Reichheld estimates that the \npattern of churn can change estimates of cohort customer value by as much as 40 percent. 17   \n\u2022 Young businesses. A related point is that investors should judge the churn of emerging business very \ncautiously. With a very high ratio of new subscribers to established subscribers, churn numbers will \nreflect higher-than-average churn rates. In order to get a good sense of churn for an industry, you \nmust follow a sufficient number of cohort groups over time.  \n\u2022 Customer quality. Companies have, and pursue, customers of varying quality. Quality includes \ncreditworthiness, use of resources, and spending patterns. Gross customer additions and churn \nstatistics rarely offer insight into the quality of the customers moving in and out of the portfolio. Not all \ncustomers are created equal.  \n \n"

Investors should \nnot evaluate acquisition costs in isolation, but rather in close conjunction with estimates of lifetime cash flows. \nCustomer NPV ultimately drives value. \n \nA comparison between cable and satellite television service\u2014rough substitutes for one another\u2014illustrates this \npoint. Companies must incur three basic costs to deliver these services to customers: central office costs, the \nconnection to the home, and the equipment on the customer\u2019s premises. While central office costs are \ncomparable, cable companies centralize their network intelligence, and hence their central offices have more \nintelligence than those of satellite. Connection to the home costs much more for the cable company, as laying \ncable is more onerous than beaming a signal. Finally, the equipment on the customer premises is a larger cost for \nthe satellite company. However, the satellite equipment provides more intelligence.  \n \nWhile competitors, these businesses are very different. Because net property, plant and equipment per subscriber \ncosts are greater for cable than satellite, the satellite companies have a much higher fixed-to-variable cost ratio. \nHowever, the cable plant, while expensive, offers substantial optionality. Cable companies can effectively offer \nmultiple services\u2014analog cable, digital cable, broadband, telephony\u2014while satellite offerings will be more limited. \n \nAlthough customer acquisition costs are much higher for satellite companies than cable companies, their average \nrevenue per user is comparable; incremental costs are less for new subscribers, and churn is measurably lower \nthan that for cable. Higher satellite acquisition costs are an artifact of network design, which investors must \nconsider in judging customer value. Today, these variables lead the market to place a higher value per subscriber \non cable companies than for their satellite competitors.       \n \nAcquisition Cost Trends \n \nAbsolute acquisition costs are clearly important, but also critical is the trend in these costs. Generally speaking, \nthere are two countervailing forces.  \n \nFirst, acquisition costs tend to rise as an industry matures and companies compete for late adopters. Since the \nspending patterns of later adopters are often not as good as earlier adopters, companies must make diligent \nspending decisions when the industry reaches maturity. \n \nOn the other hand, if a customer business benefits from network effects, it can actually see acquisition costs \ndecline as it gains share. (See Exhibit 8.) Typically, multiple networks compete for customer attention, but once \none company gets ahead, customers want to join that network precisely because others already have.  \n \nA powerful example is eBay. As CEO Meg Whitman told The Wall Street Journal, \u201cyou see that we\u2019re spending \nless than $10 to acquire each new customer. The reason is that we are being driven by word of mouth.\u201d 19 \nNetwork effects drive customer NPV by increasing revenue while lowering acquisition costs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n"

If M&A deals are close to NPV zero on average, then the value of a deal in a mature industry is a \nreasonable proxy for value per subscriber.  \n \nII. Market Size: How Many Customers? \n \nNow that we\u2019ve addressed the drivers of customer net present value, we turn to the second determinant of \nbusiness value: the number of customers. A thoughtful valuation model requires a useful framework to evaluate \nhow many customers a good or service will likely attract and how quickly the customers will accept the offering.    \n \nGet a job \n \nResearch suggests that the vast majority of new products fail. One reason for the high failure rate is that \nmarketers typically segment markets by product type, price point, or demographics. The attributes that define \nthese delineations, according to Christensen and co-author Michael Raynor, do not get to the real reason \ncustomers purchase a good or service. Customers, they argue, \u201chire\u201d a product to do a specific \u201cjob.\u201d When \ncustomers perceive a job that they need done, they look around for a product that they can hire. Christensen and \nRaynor argue that \u201cthe functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the jobs that customers need to get done \nconstitute the circumstances in which they buy.\u201d 20  \n \nTherefore the circumstances, or jobs, customers face are the proper unit of analysis in this model. Most \ncompanies do not think this way and certainly do not collect data this way. Christensen and Raynor argue that the \nlikelihood of new product success tumbles when a company assumes that the customer structures the world in \nthe same way that the company aggregates data at corporate headquarters.  \n \nInvestors should judge a new product or service\u2019s likelihood of success based on a detailed assessment of \nwhether customers will hire it to do the job.  \n \nQuantifying diffusion patterns: the Bass model \n \nSubstantial empirical evidence shows that new products or services tend to diffuse following S-curve pattern. \n(See Exhibit 9.) In the late 1960s Professor Frank Bass introduced a diffusion model that assumes that two types \nof communication channels influence a potential adopter: mass media and word of mouth. 21 Early in the diffusion \nprocess, mass media plays a relatively important role, but word of mouth takes on much more relative \nsignificance during the bulk of the adoption process. \n \nCost to acquire share\nMarket Share\nCost to acquire share\nMarket Share\n"

For example, the model generated high correlations in \npredicted and actual numbers of new adopters during the diffusion period. It also provided accurate estimates of \nthe number of peak adoptions. Finally, the model shows good ability to predict long-term diffusion patterns. 23 \n \nInvestors can use the model in a couple of ways. One approach is to estimate product potential based on actual \nparameters from past diffusions. For instance, an investor who estimates that digital video recorders are likely to \ndiffuse in a similar way as DVD players can use DVD diffusion parameters.  \n \nAlternatively, investors can start with a company\u2019s stock price and some sense of the customer NPVs and \ndetermine the subscriber number and pace of subscriber growth the market anticipates. An investor can then \ncompare the imputed parameters with empirical results to judge the likelihood of achieving the parameters.   \n \nBass offers a satellite television case study that shows the first approach. 24 In 1992 Bass forecasted the number \nof satellite television subscribers for 1999 using management guidance. In the model he assumed that (m), the \nnumber of eventual adopters, was 16 percent of homes with television sets and (p) and (q) coefficients similar to \ncable television in the 1980s (roughly .10 and .06, respectively). The model predicted 9.4 million adopters in 1999; \nin fact, the actual number was just under 10.0 million.

Managing the Customer Base: Considering the 80/20 Rule \n \nSo far we dwelled mostly on customer acquisition issues. What about more mature industries, where companies \nalready have lots of customers? For these companies, managing the customer base is key. \n \nA customer-based business\u2019s value is simply the present value of cash flows from current and future customers. \nWhile an average value per customer calculation is straightforward (e.g., market capitalization/subscriber) and \nwidely used, it doesn\u2019t reflect that today\u2019s customers typically have a wide range of attractiveness\u2014from great \nvalue-creating customers to value-destroying customers. (See Exhibit 11.) Often, companies do not know which \ncustomers create or destroy value. Too often a company\u2019s perceived best customers turn out to destroy the most \nvalue. 25  \n \nExhibit 11: Customer Profitability Chart \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Larry Selden and Geoffrey Colvin, Angel Customers & Demon Customers (New York: Portfolio Books, 2003), 57. Copyrighted \nmaterial, used by permission. \n \nTo disaggregate the averages companies must look at the economic profit of each of their customers or customer \nsegments. Economic profit compares the customer\u2019s cash flows to the cost of servicing the customer. While most \ncompanies have a firm grasp on aggregate customer cash flows, they have only a vague sense of the fully \nallocated customer costs.  \n \nWhen companies properly calculate customer economics they often find a variation of the 80/20 rule applies: 20 \npercent of the customers generate 80 percent of the economic profit. In many cases, the numbers are much more \nextreme. In their book, Angel Customers & Demon Customers, Larry Selden and Geoff Colvin note a retail bank \nfound that 17 percent of its customers accounted for 93 percent of the profits and that a major software maker \ndetermined that only 2 percent of its customers were profitable. 26  \n    \nSome companies use customer profitability data to more aggressively manage their customers. This means \ntreating unattractive customers differently (e.g., like raising prices or refusing service) and paying more attention \nto attractive customers. The most difficult part of this process is reorienting customer value propositions to \nsimultaneously satisfy customers and improve profitability. Most companies cannot overcome organizational \nhurdles to implement such changes.  \n \n"

Tools include churn prediction models that allow the \ncompanies to determine when a customer is likely to leave and models to identify which customers \nare likely to take offers. These models allow wireless companies opportunities to communicate with \ncustomers at key times, hence reducing churn and increasing value. 27 \n \n\u2022 \nConsumer electronics retailer Best Buy estimates up to 20 percent of its customers are \nunprofitable. As a result, the company identified profitable customers (they have nicknames for \nsome groups\u2014the suburban mothers are \u201cJills\u201d and the upper-income men are \u201cBarrys\u201d), trained its \nsales staff, and reconfigured roughly fifteen percent of its stores to better tailor to their needs. \nAccording to Best Buy CEO Brad Anderson, the pilot stores are \u201cclobbering\u201d the conventional \nstores, with twice the rate of same-store sales and higher close rates. Best Buy expects to roll out \nthe customization program to the rest of their stores over the next three years. 28 \n \n\u2022 \nSince joining Harrah\u2019s Entertainment, former Harvard Business School professor and current CEO \nGary Loveman has driven to use customer data to better manage the business. With a \ntransactional data base over 300 gigabytes large, Harrah\u2019s can now trace over three-quarters of its \nrevenues to specific gamblers. One of the early surprises was that 26 percent of the gamblers that \nvisited Harrah\u2019s generated over 80 percent of the revenues. The casino found that high rollers, \nhistorically coveted, are often unattractive customers. Harrah\u2019s now calculates customer value \nbroadly and proactively encourages its best customers to come back while disincentivizing \nunattractive gamblers. 29      \n \nWe expect to see more and more companies use customer NPV techniques to manage their businesses. \nSuccess will bring higher cash flows and ultimately a higher stock price. But most companies are not organized to \nmeasure or manage customer lifetime value today, and one reason for that is our current accounting system.  \n \nIV. Accounting for Customer Value \n \nIn the mid 1990s, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged that America Online, Inc. (AOL) \nviolated generally accepted accounting principles by amortizing instead of expensing membership acquisition \ncosts. According to the SEC, AOL\u2019s fiscal 1995 loss would have been $98 million instead of the reported $21 \nmillion loss and fiscal 1996\u2019s $62 million in earnings would have been a $175 million loss. 30 \n \nBy amortizing membership acquisition costs (over a 24-month period in fiscal 1996), AOL definitely changed its \naccounting results. But how the company accounted for its marketing outlays did not affect the basic unit of \nanalysis\u2014customer NPV. 31 The central question for AOL shareholders has not changed: is the present value of \ncustomer lifetime cash flows greater than the cost to acquire the customer? If so, grow.  \n \nThe goal of an investor is to find stocks where the stock market is likely to revise the embedded expectations for \nfuture financial performance. For long-term oriented shareholders, the expectations that matter surround the \npresent value of a company\u2019s free cash flows. For customer-centric businesses a firm grasp of customer \neconomics\u2014the basic unit of analysis\u2014is essential to maximizing the likelihood of successfully anticipating an \nexpectations revision.   \n \nIn summary, customer NPVs are rarely static:  \n \n\u2022 \nCustomer revenues may vary based on the type of business \n\u2022 \nLevels of customer service (and hence cost) differ from customer-to-customer \n\u2022 \nThere are trade-offs between churn and revenue \n\u2022 \nA company\u2019s cost structure (level or preproduction costs) can shape the value of an incremental \ncustomer \n"

In the early stages of industry development, churn data are not very reliable but gauging the \nmarket potential and the industry\u2019s cost structure (i.e., preproduction costs and the ratio of fixed to \nvariable costs) is critical. Customer retention and managing the customer base are of little importance. \nSatellite radio is a good example of a phase I industry. \n\u2022 \nPhase II. In the middle phase, churn data become more reliable, value per subscriber figures to \nmoderate, and companies must strike a balance between customer acquisition and customer \nretention/management. Satellite television is now in phase II.  \n\u2022 \nPhase III. Once the industry matures, churn data are reasonably reliable and customer retention and \nmanagement becomes paramount. Here companies must understand the value of the customer base and \ntailor offerings to maximize value. Customer acquisition issues become less relevant to value.

We \ncan further distinguish between price bundling and functionality bundling. Price bundling is simply offering a host \nof services at a lower aggregate cost than each of the services would cost individually. Functionality bundling \nintegrates services and makes them work together. An example of price bundling would be a lower rate for a \nsubscription of wireline and wireless phone service. An example of functionality bundling is the integration of the \ntwo services so that calls to a wireline number would be seamlessly forwarded to a wireless phone and vice \nversa.
