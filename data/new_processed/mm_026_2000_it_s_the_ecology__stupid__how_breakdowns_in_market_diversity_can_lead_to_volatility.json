Without fail,\nMr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your in-\nterest or sell his. Even though the business that the two of you own may have\neconomic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market\u2019s quotations will be anything\nbut. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems.\u201d\n\u2014Warren Buffett paraphrasing Benjamin Graham1\nEvery day countless investors, through the buying and selling of securities, make\nstatements about the value of businesses in the marketplace. From this chaotic\nmaelstrom emerges a price tag for every public company. At any point, the pre-\nvailing price reflects the best collective statement about what an individual secu-\nrity is worth. The characteristics of this complex adaptive system\u2014known simply\nas \u201cthe market\u201d\u2014are heavily scrutinized, and highly contentious.2 And though the\nviews of academics and practitioners are frequently at odds, one thing is certain:\nit\u2019s very difficult to consistently beat the market.3\nBenjamin Graham\u2019s metaphor of Mr. Market is meant to illustrate the reality of\nhow moment to moment price swings can depart from \u201cfundamental\u201d value. While\nmost active investors are aware of the mechanics surrounding securities trading,\nfew fully understand the degree to which prices pay a concession to these\nmechanics.\nIn an ideal world, there are no transaction costs. Information is free, available to\nall market participants, and investors agree on the implications of that informa-\ntion.4 Economist Ronald Coase astutely observed that the dismal science often\nmisses the mark due to the fact that \u201ctheir theoretical system [does not] take into\naccount a factor which is essential if one wishes to analyze the effect of a change\nin the law on the allocation of resources. The missing factor is the existence of\ntransaction costs.\"5 Trading securities involves matching buyers and sellers within\na particular market structure. What\u2019s important is that this market structure itself\ninfluences price formation.\nIlliquidity is chief among the anomaly-causing frictions. Liquidity is an all-\nencompassing term that captures popular concepts like supply, demand, order\nflow, and market depth. Though strictly defined as the ease with which an asset\ncan be turned into cash, it is best understood as the cost of immediacy. That is,\nit\u2019s the cost of getting what you want when you want it. Illiquidity is best viewed as\nan important and large cost of transacting. For example, transaction costs include\nboth the bid-ask spread and market impact\u2014where the very act of trading\nchanges the stock price.\nWhile the effect of liquidity on stock prices has been studied in detail, a less well-\nknown but equally powerful influence on prices is market ecology. Market ecology\ndeals with the composition of the underlying agents that set prices. While liquidity\nis highly correlated with the number of market participants, market ecology is a\ndirect function of the type of market participants in the system. More directly, the\ntypes of investors in the market, and their degree of participation, has a signifi-\ncant influence on how well markets function.\nThis issue of ecology is important not only because it lends insight into how mar-\nkets function, but it also provides a basis for potential moneymaking opportuni-\nties. For example, a commonly held belief of market observers is that the steep\nrise in the number of day traders over the last couple of years has led to in-\ncreased market volatility and a diminution of market efficiency. A deeper under-\nstanding of market ecology helps illustrate why this concern is misplaced.\n"

This has engendered greater uncertainty, and has called into question the\ncompetitive position of virtually every business.\nFigure 1\nAverage Market Volatility for 18 Indexes\nIndex of Implied Volatilities\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n4/24/98\n6/24/98\n8/24/98\n10/24/98\n12/24/98\n2/24/99\n4/24/99\n6/24/99\n8/24/99\n10/24/99\n12/24/99\n2/24/00\nSource: Bloomberg and CSFB analysis.\nAlthough numerous studies corroborate the upward trend in volatility documented\nin Figure 1, it\u2018s incorrect to assume that volatility is at historic highs. In fact, most\nstudies of market volatility over the last century conclude that the recent period of\nvolatility is hardly an aberration.8\nThe most recent surge in market volatility, between mid-October 1999 and mid-\nApril 2000, came at a time when the number of equity trading accounts rose\n15%.9 According to SIA member firms, these newcomers opened online and\nmargin accounts in record numbers. The seeming daily gyrations in the Nasdaq\ncomposite coupled with margin debt soaring to levels not seen since 1929 con-\nvinced many market watchers that these \u201cnew wave\u201d investors were the \u201ccause\u201d\nof all the volatility.10 We believe this commonly held notion is incorrect and re-\nflects an important misunderstanding about the nature of securities markets.\nVolatile Views on Volatility\nVolatility has many sources. These include the influx of new, unanticipated infor-\nmation into the market, an alteration in market structure, and the changing risk\ntolerance of investors. In addition, changes in macroeconomic policy can have a\nprofound effect on volatility.\nBut there is another significant and generally unexplored dimension of volatility. It\nhas to do with the \u201cecology\u201d of investors. The word ecology comes from biology,\nwhere it is used to refer to the ways in which living things interact with one an-\n"

How investment \u201cspecies\u201d interact (i.e., market\nparticipants with particular investment styles) has a direct bearing on price volatil-\nity. The balance of this report focuses on this largely unexplored issue.\nEcology\nFor the last two centuries, the machine has been the dominant metaphor for de-\nscribing the economy. Increasingly, leading thinkers accept the view that a capi-\ntalist economy is best understood as a living ecosystem, complete with competi-\ntion, specialization, cooperation, exploitation, learning, and growth.11 In his\ngroundbreaking book, Bionomics, Michael Rothschild argues that the analogy\nbetween ecosystem and economy does not need to be perfect in order to be\npowerful. The central concept is that biological and economic life are self-\norganized, and operate in much the same fashion. A parallel relationship exists\nbetween an ecosystem based on genetic information and an economy derived\nfrom technical information.12\nFigure 2\nInteracting Species Interacting Strategies\nBiological Ecology\nFinancial Ecology\nspecies\ntrading strategy\nindividual organism\ntrader\ngenotype\nfunctional representation of strategy\nphenotype\nactions of strategy (buying, selling)\npopulation\ncapital\nexternal environment\nprice and other informational inputs\nniche\na possible flow of money\nselection\ncapital allocation\nmutation and recombination\ncreation of new strategies\nSource: Doyne Farmer, \u201cMarket Force, Ecology, and Evolution.\u201d\nAs Figure 2 illustrates, it\u2019s not just the general economy that can be understood in\nthis way, but securities markets as well. The relationship between species inter-\nacting in an ecosystem on the basis of genetic information mirrors that of inves-\ntors in the stock market interacting on the basis of evolving valuation strategies.\nMarkets Are Complex\nWe believe that securities markets are best understood as complex adaptive\nsystems. 13 A complex adaptive system can be described in three steps. First,\nthere are lots of agents, each operating with their own decision rules. Next,\nthe interactions between the agents become the basis of \u201cemergence\u201d\u2014the\naggregate becomes more complicated than the sum of the parts. Finally, a\n\u201cmeta-system\u201d is created that has distinct characteristics.\nAgents exist in a variety of types, each with their own characteristics. They em-\nploy their strategies\u2014conditional action patterns that indicate what should be\ndone under certain circumstances\u2014by interacting with other agents.14 Each\nagent uses success criterion to attribute credit in selecting relatively successful or\nunsuccessful strategies. This in turn leads to a process that increases or de-\ncreases the frequency of various types of agents or strategies.15\nIn stock market language, \u201cagents\u201d are investors. Their \u201cstrategies\u201d are invest-\nment styles\u2014growth, value, momentum, etc. Their scorecard is performance,\neither absolute or versus a benchmark. And because of the market\u2019s never-\nending change, various investors succeed and fail.\n"

Variety represents the diversity of agent types within a population\nor system. Variation provides the raw material for adaptation. The premise of\nthe complex adaptive system (CAS) approach is that agents are diverse. The\ndefault assumption is that this variety within the population matters. In equity\nmarkets, agents mostly have \u201clocal\u201d information. The result of combining the\nknowledge of the individual participants is that the whole knows more than\nthe parts. Mainstream economics maintains that all economic players are\nhomogenous: not only do agents value information in the same way, but they\nneed the same information and react to it accordingly. This tenet has pro-\nfound implications.16 Standard economic theory should lead to limited trading\nactivity, which isn\u2019t what we see in markets. It is precisely the variation\namong the agents and their strategies that provides for a robust market\nenvironment.\n\u2022 \nInteraction. Interaction between agents creates many of the interesting\nevents in a system. In an equity market, the interactions of financial agents\nare mediated through a single variable\u2014the stock price. Each trading strat-\negy influences the price. The price, in turn, influences each trading strategy.\nRecurring regularities of contact occur among types within a system. In equity\nmarkets this contact is dictated by the market structure.\n\u2022 \nSelection. Selection leads to an increase or decrease in the various types of\nagents and strategies. Performance measures define success. Success or\nfailure often leads to new or refined strategies. Instead of categorizing in-\nvesting strategies into broad groups, we find that it\u2019s useful to view them\nalong a continuum. At one end are the \u201cvalue,\u201d or fundamental strategies,\nbased on some subjective view about the difference between a security\u2019s in-\ntrinsic worth and its price. Strategies that focus on price history, either to fol-\nlow trends or to augur future movements, occupy the other pole. Strategies\nalong the continuum are thus defined by their proximity to subjective as-\nsessments of value versus market-watching behavior. At any time, the cur-\nrent distribution of valuation and trading strategies reflects the relative suc-\ncess of each strategy. And most \u201cchanges\u201d are refinements to existing market\nstrategies, rather than wholesale shifts to another strategy.\nWe suggest turning classic economic theory on its head. Instead of assuming that\nall investors have equal access to information, evaluate it in the same fashion,\nand have the same goals and time horizons for investment, we take the opposite\ntack. As proof we offer up the market itself!17 Trading goes on precisely because\nall investors are not equal in their access to information or their interpretation of\nthat information. Trading, and the differences of opinion that it reveals, is essen-\ntial for maintaining liquid markets.\nIn professional golf circles, they say that every shot makes someone happy.\nSimilarly, in the market there is a buyer for every seller. However, buyers and\nsellers do not necessarily pair off because their views on the prospects for the\ncompany are antipode. Often, it is for altogether different reasons: portfolio bal-\nancing, capturing an uptick on a trade, or a multitude of other reasons. The chal-\nlenge is to model the market in its full diversity, in an effort to gain some insight\ninto how the various agents contribute to prices and the inevitable swings that the\nmarket witnesses every day.\n"

Fundamental investors are further divided into four sub-\ncategories, and all six types of agents buy and sell a single stock. A running\n\u201cvaluation scorecard\u201d changes to reflect new information events that are imported\ninto the market. All agents submit orders to buy or sell to the specialist (who\nmaintains a book of orders) based on the sensitivity of their respective valuation\nmetrics. The submitted trades establish a market price. This market price is re-\ncorded over time. At the end of the simulation, the average bid/ask spread, aver-\nage volume, and volatility can be documented. In addition, the stock price at each\ntransaction is written to a file. The results after roughly 500 simulations were\ncombined, and appear in Figure 3.\nFigure 3\nMarket Simulation Conclusions\nMarket Simulation Summary\n-8%\n-6%\n-4%\n-2%\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n  Spread                          Volume                      Volatility\nFluctuation (%) Maximum Diversity\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nThe three plots represent the combined data for all the scenarios with the least\namount of financial actors (the least diversity and most homogeneity). The per-\ncentage amounts indicate the spread between these runs and the combined data\nruns for all the scenarios with the greatest diversity in financial actors (most di-\nversity and least homogeneity).

This is especially true\nwhen compared to unrealistic models of homogenous agents. Our model clearly\nshows that active participation by a diverse group of financial agents leads to less\nvolatility and more structural efficiency. The implications of this research are\nworth examining in closer detail.\nDay Traders\nOne group of agents cannot be held responsible for excessive market volatility.\nUnderstanding volatility requires understanding the interaction between multiple\nagent types. Heightened \u201cmarket-structure\u201d volatility requires that some agent\ntypes either willfully opt out of the market activity or trade in a manner that reflects\nthe decision rules of another class of agents. These scenarios result in effective\nhomogeneity, which creates rigidity and leads to endogenous volatility.19\nFigure 4\nNo Day Traders\nVo la tility\n2 7 .5\n2 7 .6\n2 7 .7\n2 7 .8\n2 7 .9\n2 8\n2 8 .1\n2 8 .2\n2 8 .3\n2 8 .4\n2 8 .5\nNo  Da y  T r a d e r    Da y  T r a d e r\nHigh/Low Price Range\nS p re a d\n0 .4 3 6\n0 .4 3 8\n0 .4 4\n0 .4 4 2\n0 .4 4 4\n0 .4 4 6\n0 .4 4 8\n0 .4 5\n0 .4 5 2\nNo  Da y  T r a d e r       Da y  T r a d e r\nDecimal Spread\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nFigure 4 represents summary data for eight market trials. Four involved a market\nwith all the agents outlined in the model. The other four excluded day traders\nfrom the group entirely. Without the participation of day traders, the bid ask\nspread widened in every trial. In addition, the volatility of the market (as indicated\nby price dispersion through one trading cycle) increased in every trial where the\nmuch-maligned day trader was absent. This pattern was observed in 44 addi-\ntional trials, where we actively modified the relative composition of fundamental\nagents. This result reflects trials where day traders consisted of as much as 15%\nof the total agents in the market\u2014a figure roughly five times the amount tallied by\nthe Securities & Exchange Commission in a recent report.20\nEcological Volatility\nVolatility resulting from a breakdown in the ecology of investors is a permanent\nfeature of markets. However, the markets of today bear some peculiar features\nthat might make them more prone to excess volatility from this particular feature\nof market structure. The information revolution raises a fundamental question\nabout the ability of social networks to maintain their diversity. Drawing on \u201csmall\nworld\u201d network research, some observers conjecture that we might be crossing a\nthreshold where increased interaction among previously distant agents leads to a\nradical decrease in global diversity.21 Greater contact with \u201cdistant others\u201d allows\nfor information (or rumor) to travel faster through the system.\n"

These strategies are then reinforced by a growing\nnumber of information channels, blunting needed variety. Two crucial elements of\ncomplex adaptive systems are nonlinearity and critical points. Nonlinearity is the\nidea that the output of a system need not necessarily be proportionate with the\ninput of the system. In mathematical terms, complex dynamical systems can go\nthrough \u201ccritical points\u201d where a small-scale stimulus can lead to sudden, explo-\nsive, large-scale effects.\nResearchers have modeled this behavior for stock markets. Guided by these\nmodels, they conclude that crashes can result from the slow buildup of long-run\ncorrelations, leading to a collapse in one critical instant.22 It is important to note\nthat a crash occurs when a large group of agents simultaneously place sell or-\nders. So a crash actually results when \u201corder\u201d wins out (i.e., when everybody has\nthe same opinion, or revealed preference). Interestingly, this is in contrast to the\n\u201cchaos\u201d and flurry of activity that occurs in the wake of a crash.\nWhat is the mechanism for this massive, but uncoordinated, homogeneous be-\nhavior? The answer lies with the structure of social networks. Models of such be-\nhavior show that spontaneous local imitation (small clusters of traders influencing\neach other) can quickly propagate over a network, leading to global cooperation.\nWhen we consider the ecology of investors in conjunction with this framework, it\nis clear that agents that typically form idiosyncratic opinions about intrinsic value\n(agents closest to this valuation pole) must either become uncertain about their\nforecasts and \u201cdrop out,\u201d or begin to swing toward market watching behavior. In\neither instance the result is the same: excessive volatility.\nBeyond Efficiency\nThink beyond market efficiency. The growing evidence provided by market mod-\nels of heterogeneous agents prompts us to approach the dated market efficiency\ndebate with a fresh perspective. While it\u2019s hard to be smarter than the market as\na single actor in a complex adaptive system, Warren Buffett\u2019s insightful admoni-\ntion regarding volatility becomes more pertinent than ever. \u201cIf you can manage\nthe risk between your ears, then volatility truly becomes your friend.\u201d23 That is,\ninvestors with a solid sense of intrinsic value\u2014those long-term investors that stick\nto their cash flow guns and don\u2019t \u201cdrop out\u201d\u2014stand to gain from the additional\nbuying opportunities presented in a volatile market environment. While identifying\necology breakdowns in equity prices is a difficult task, an understanding of how\ndiverse financial agents interact and set prices can point to potential moneymak-\ning ideas.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager\nor co-manager of a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies\nmentioned.\n"
