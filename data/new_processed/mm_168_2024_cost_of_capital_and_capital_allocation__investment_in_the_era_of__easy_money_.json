During this period the Fed \nalso initiated multiple rounds of asset purchases in the open \nmarket to lower interest rates and increase the supply of money. \nThe Federal Reserve reversed course in early 2022 and started \naggressively raising interest rates to more than five percent by the \nend of 2023.2  \nThis era began as an attempt to heal the wounds from the Global \nFinancial Crisis of 2007 to 2008, and was punctuated by additional \neasing in 2020 to mitigate the negative economic shock that the \nCOVID-19 pandemic caused. It ended in an attempt to tame the \ninflation that rose sharply in 2021 and persisted through 2022. \nFor this analysis, we examine two periods of equal duration: the \nphase of easy money (2009-2021) and the thirteen years \npreceding it (1996-2008). The label of easy money suggests some \ndistinctions between the periods. We expect to see lower short- \nand long-term interest rates in the easy money period than in the \none before it. That is the case. The average yield on the 10-year \nU.S. Treasury note, calculated monthly, was 2.3 percent from \n2009-2021 versus 5.0 percent from 1996-2008. \nAll things being equal, declining interest rates are good for asset \nprices because future cash flows are worth more when they are \ndiscounted at a lower rate. Here again, the point is borne out. The \ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the S&P 500, an index \nof the largest public companies in the U.S., was 16.0 percent \nwhen there was easy money and 4.8 percent in the equivalent \ntime before. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n6416509 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n2\n \n \nEarnings growth was higher in the easy money phase than in the prior one in part because it started as the result \nof poor economic conditions and depressed earnings in 2008. But the returns also benefited from an expansion \nin the price-earnings (P/E) multiple, a natural outcome of lower rates. The CAGR for the S&P 500 was 9.6 \npercent from 1928 to 2023, so the returns during the easy money era were exceptional.3 \nEasy money periods have a long history of spurring financial shenanigans, and the recent episode was no \nexception.4 For example, investors took on greater risk in search of returns (see appendix). This contributed to \nthe financing of highly speculative companies, money flowing into nefarious schemes in the cryptocurrency \nsector, and an increase in the number of \u201czombie firms,\u201d companies unable to service their debt with present \nprofits but able to access cheap financing.5  \nThere was also a flurry of interest in meme stocks, which traded based more on social media hype than on \nfundamentals, and a surge in the number of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) seeking to do \ndeals. These booms were followed by a bust after the end of easy money.6 \nOur focus is on how U.S. public companies acted in the regime of easy money. In theory, lower interest rates \nand ready access to capital would suggest that public companies invest more, use more debt, and hold less \ncash. More abundant investment opportunities would also imply restraint from returning cash to shareholders. \nBut that is not what public companies did. \nWe place particular emphasis on the observation that companies often use hurdle rates that are substantially \nhigher than their cost of capital based on market indicators, and that share buybacks will contribute less to \nearnings per share growth now than they did in the period of easy money given today\u2019s valuation multiples and \ninterest rates. \nDiscount Rates, Cost of Capital, and Return on Invested Capital    \nThis first example of a gap between theory and practice is how public companies reacted to lower interest rates. \nWe estimate that the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for companies in the Russell 3000 dropped to \n6.9 percent in the time of easy money from 7.5 percent in the prior period, based on annual averages. The \nRussell 3000 Index includes the largest 3,000 U.S. companies and represents nearly all of the investable equity \nmarket in the U.S. \nStandard corporate finance dictates that companies fund projects that have a positive net present value (NPV), \ndefined as when the present value of the future cash flows from an investment exceeds the initial outlay. For \nexample, if the investment to acquire a customer is $1,000 and the present value of the cash flows that customer \nis expected to generate is $1,500, the NPV is $500. The company ought to acquire that customer because the \ninvestment passes the NPV test ($500 = $1,500 \u2013 $1,000).  \nCompanies should ideally rank their investment opportunities and pursue those that pass the NPV test. A lower \ncost of capital boosts the future cash flows and therefore allows more investments to clear the hurdle. A logical \nconsequence is an increase in investment opportunity. \nSurveys of executives over decades reveal that changes in the cost of capital have a muted effect on their \ndecisions. Most firms do have an internal estimate of the cost of capital, which researchers determined through \nthe analysis of more than 100,000 paragraphs in the transcripts of quarterly conference calls from 2002 to 2022.7 \n"

Rather, about 80 percent of companies adopt a hurdle rate that is \nsubstantially higher than the cost of capital (see exhibit 1). In the period of easy money, for instance, the \nresearchers estimate that the average hurdle rate was 16.8 percent, more than double the average perceived \ncost of capital of 8.3 percent.8  \nCompanies around the globe also have a gap between the hurdle rate and cost of capital, albeit the disparity is \nthe largest in the U.S.9 This observation runs counter to the idea that companies have to increase their discount \nrates to reflect the end of easy money.10 \nExhibit 1: Hurdle Rates and Perceived Cost of Capital for U.S. Companies, 2002-2021  \n \nSource: costofcapital.org and Counterpoint Global. \nThis is relevant because, in theory, the present value of one dollar of earnings in perpetuity is twice as high if you \ndiscount it by the perceived cost of capital ($12.05 = $1 \u00f7 0.083) than by the hurdle rate ($5.95 = $1 \u00f7 0.168).     \nJohn Graham, a professor of finance, has been surveying financial executives for decades.11 He makes three \nobservations about how executives actually make decisions. First, they are very conservative, which helps \nexplain the policy of using a hurdle rate much higher than the perceived cost of capital. The gap between the \nhurdle rate and cost of capital can offset the effect of cash flow forecasts that are too optimistic.  \nThe idea is that in practice two wrongs, overestimating cash flows and applying a hurdle rate that is too high, \nmake a right. Take the example of capitalizing earnings. If the plan is to earn $2 from a project and the company \ndiscounts it at the hurdle rate, it is worth $11.90 ($11.90 = $2 \u00f7 0.168). But in reality the company actually earns \n$1, worth $12.05 when discounted by the cost of capital. The value of the overstated cash flow and discount \nrate yield a value similar to the proper cash flow and discount rate ($11.90 versus $12.05).    \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nPercent\nHurdle Rate\nPerceived Cost of Capital\n"

As a result, they do not move their hurdle rates \nfrequently. Overall hurdle rates in recent decades have come down much less than what market rates would \nsuggest. In addition, companies tend to allocate capital internally the same way from year to year even when a \nmore dynamic process would generate higher returns.12  \nFinally, executives suffer from a form of overconfidence called \u201coverprecision,\u201d defined as excessive certainty in \nthe accuracy of one\u2019s judgment.\u201d13 And they commonly forecast ranges of outcomes that are too optimistic. This \nis the main reason financial executives use a hurdle rate that is higher than the cost of capital: it helps cushion \nthe blow of rosy forecasts. Financial executives are fine with using a hurdle rate well above the cost of capital \nbecause they are aware that the projected returns are generally too high on the investments they approve.  \nExhibit 2 shows that the aggregate return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as net operating profit after taxes \ndivided by invested capital, averaged 9.5 percent in the easy money period and 9.2 percent in the preceding \ntime. Companies earn an ROIC in the aggregate that is roughly 50-60 percent of the hurdle rate they use. That \nmeans a lot of investments fail to earn the hurdle rate. \nBut, on average, companies in the U.S. do earn an ROIC in excess of the actual cost of capital.14 The average \nspread between the ROIC and WACC was 2.6 percentage points in the easy money era and 1.7 percentage \npoints in the prior period. \nExhibit 2: ROIC and Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Russell 3000, 1996-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global.  \nEconomic profit is defined as the spread between the ROIC and WACC multiplied by invested capital. The point \nis you need to know how much a company will earn relative to the cost of capital as well as how much it will \ninvest at that spread.

Companies largely rely on the cash their businesses generate to fund their investments. Investments can \nbe internal, such as capital expenditures, working capital, research and development (R&D), and intangible \ninvestments within selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense excluding R&D. Investments can also \nbe external, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A). \nExhibit 3 shows investments, including capital expenditures, M&A, R&D, and non-R&D SG&A, as a percentage \nof sales in the period of easy money versus the prior one.15 Counter to the assumption that lower interest rates \nlead to higher investment activity, investments were 24.5 percent of sales from 2009-2021 versus 27.3 percent \nfrom 1996-2008. Only intangible investments were higher. \nExhibit 3: Investment as Percent of Sales for Companies in the Russell 3000, 1996-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global \nNote: Capital expenditures and M&A reflect all sectors; R&D and non-R&D SG&A exclude financial and real estate sectors. \nThe easy money era launched following the Global Financial Crisis, which may have made companies skittish \nto invest. But the preceding period included the dot-com bust and a three-year bear market in stocks, which also \ndeterred investment. \nThese sums reflect total spending on these investments. It is common to break down spending into components \nof growth and maintenance. Proxies for maintenance spending include depreciation for tangible assets and \namortization for intangible assets. The decline in growth investments, to 9.5 percent of sales from 12.7 percent, \nwas similar to the overall pattern.   \nDespite lower capital costs, companies invested at a slower rate and the spread between ROIC and the cost of \ncapital widened. Aggregate invested capital grew at a 2.6 percent CAGR in the easy money era and 4.9 percent \nin the previous period. Both figures are adjusted for inflation. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nPercent\nAvg=24.5%\nAvg=27.3%\n"

All rights reserved. \n6416509 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n6\n \n \nM&A is consistently one of the largest forms of investment.16 Deals create value in the aggregate because there \nare commonly synergies, which are cost or revenue benefits of putting the businesses together. Researchers \nmeasure overall value as the increase in the combined market capitalizations of the buyer and seller from before \nto after the deal.  \nBut wealth transfers also happen frequently. A buyer generally has to offer a premium to the seller\u2019s stock price \nto assume control. If the premium exceeds the value of the synergy, there is a wealth transfer from the \nshareholders of the buyer to the shareholders of the seller. The market signals this transfer when the buyer\u2019s \nstock price goes down beyond what would be expected based on changes in the overall stock market. \nHistorically, a majority of deals failed to create value for the buyer based on this measure.17 However, there was \na marked change following the Global Financial Crisis, and the success rate of buyers improved substantially.  \nWhile the dates do not align exactly with our designation, one study found that buyers had an average abnormal \nreturn of positive 1.05 percent from 2010 to 2015 versus negative 1.08 percent from 1990 to 2009. Further, the \nresearch concluded that 54 percent of deals added value for the buyer, up from 42 percent in the earlier time.18 \nAnother study, using somewhat different data, also found that success rates improved markedly after 2009.19 \nThere does not appear to be a simple explanation for this result. Candidates include the phase within the M&A \ncycle, investor demand for growth, and the benefit of lower interest rates.20 In any case, the benefit faded after \nCOVID-19 took grip of the world economy in 2020.21 \nCompanies did not spend more on investments in the easy money era despite a lower cost of capital than in the \nprior time. There are multiple potential explanations for this lack of investment, including decreased competition \nand heightened governance.22 Indeed, the aggregate ROIC for public companies in the U.S. rose to a level \nabove the long-term average.  \nAs John Graham says, \u201csticky hurdle rates make a lower cost of capital less relevant, and thus, imply that \nmonetary policy (i.e., reducing interest rates) may not be able to spur corporate investment.\u201d23 Companies are \naware that the cost of capital is lower but do not change their investment patterns as a result. Over the long \nhaul, investment growth shows little link to short- or long-term interest rates.24  \nAll things being equal, lower interest rates allow companies to take on more debt while maintaining similar ratios \nof operating profit to interest expense. Lower rates also make holding excess cash less desirable as it earns \nmodest returns. In theory we would expect companies to increase leverage and decrease cash holdings. That \nis not what they did.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6416509 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n7\n \n \nLower Interest Rates and Financial Leverage \nFranco Modigliani and Merton Miller, economists who would each go on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in \nEconomic Sciences, published a famous paper showing that a company\u2019s capital structure does not affect its \nvalue under a strict set of conditions.25 The beauty of the approach is that we can see why the capital structure \ndoes matter by relaxing the conditions to better fit reality. The big condition is the assumption of no taxes.  \nA company has to deal with numerous stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, \nand the government. The ability to tax a company\u2019s profit is the government\u2019s main claim on the firm.  \nFor many countries, interest expense is considered a cost of doing business and hence lessens taxable \nincome.26 This reduces the value of the government\u2019s claim and increases the value to other stakeholders. The \nright amount of debt creates a valuable tax shield while maintaining sufficient financial flexibility in case the \ncompany experiences adverse business results.    \nCorporate practice differs from theory. Companies tend to settle on a capital structure with less debt than what \nis ideal because they are conservative and prize resilience. The tax deductibility of interest expense, considered \nimportant by 60 percent of chief financial officers (CFOs) in a survey done in 2001, was deemed important by \nless than 25 percent of CFOs in a survey completed two decades later.  \nThis likely reflects lower tax rates. Taxes were 19.4 percent of operating income in the easy money era for U.S. \npublic companies, excluding financial companies, versus 25.6 percent in the prior period.  \nExhibit 4 shows the debt to total capital ratio for the Russell 3000, excluding financials and real estate, in \naggregate from 1996 to 2021. Total capital is defined as the book value of debt plus the market value of equity. \nThe average ratio was 21.6 percent in the era of easy money, down from 32.7 percent in the previous period. \nThe change in the aggregate was much more than in the median, suggesting that most of the deleveraging \nhappened among the larger companies. Further, the interest coverage ratio, operating income divided by interest \nexpense, was 7.9 times, up from 5.5 times preceding the time of easy money.27 \nExhibit 4: Debt to Total Capital Ratio for the Russell 3000, 1996-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Russell 3000 excluding financial and real estate sectors. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nPercent\nAvg=21.6%\nAvg=32.7%\n"

But the ratio drifted lower \nthroughout the 13-year period, suggesting that companies did not have the appetite to increase leverage. \nLower interest rates mean cheaper borrowing costs. But they also imply less interest income from the excess \ncash and marketable securities that companies hold. In theory, companies would not want to hold substantial \namounts of cash earning next to nothing. \nExhibit 5 shows excess cash and marketable securities as a percent of assets in the two regimes. We define \nexcess as any amount above two percent of sales. That ratio doubled, to 9.0 from 4.3 percent, in the period of \neasy money.

Specifically, 10 companies held one-\nquarter of the cash, 25 firms one-third, and 80 firms one-half.  \nCompanies place much higher emphasis on financial flexibility than on interest rates when deciding on their \ncapital structure.28 The data are shaped a great deal by large companies that are unusually conservative both \nin capital structure and in holding excess cash.

This is because the selling shareholders get less than what the stock is worth and the \nintrinsic value per share rises for the ongoing shareholders. Buying back undervalued stock is an excellent way \nto build long-term value per share for ongoing shareholders, which should be the goal of management.  \nBut executives are not always discerning. For example, most believe that the stock of their company is \nundervalued. A survey of CFOs in 2020 found that 83 percent of them held this view, and a majority of them \nsaid the same going back to 1996.30 Further, the most popular method to value the stock, revealed in a survey \ncompleted in 2022, was \u201ccurrent price relative to historic highs and lows.\u201d By contrast, \u201cinternal valuation \nperformed by company\u201d was the fourth most popular.31  \nResearch also shows that executives make financial decisions that stray from the ideal of creating long-term \nvalue for continuing shareholders and instead focus on maximizing earnings per share (EPS).32 The era of easy \nmoney made buybacks particularly effective at boosting EPS.   \nCFOs, when asked, indicate that they are very aware of the link between buybacks and EPS. In one survey, 76 \npercent of CFOs said that increasing EPS was an important, or very important, factor in the decision to buy back \nstock, and 68 percent indicated that offsetting EPS dilution from stock-based compensation (SBC) was important \nor very important.33 More than one-third of buybacks by big companies in recent years have been to counter the \ndilutive effect of SBC.34  \nFinancial executives hold these views despite a lack of evidence that using buybacks to increase EPS creates \nshareholder value.35 However, EPS are relevant for executive compensation in many companies, providing \nmanagement teams with sufficient incentive to use buybacks as a means to lift earnings. \nIt is worth examining why buybacks are so effective at boosting EPS when interest rates are low. To start, \nbuybacks do not always increase EPS despite lowering the number of shares outstanding. The reason is that \nthe company must pay for a buyback using either excess cash or the proceeds from borrowing. Because excess \ncash earns interest income and debt incurs interest expense, net income is lower following a buyback than it \nwould have been without the buyback.36  \nWe can calculate the impact of buybacks on EPS by comparing the after-tax interest rate (either on interest \nincome from cash or interest expense from debt) to the earnings yield, defined as earnings divided by price (the \nreciprocal of the P/E multiple). Buybacks add to EPS when the earnings yield is higher than the after-tax interest \nrate. The size of the buyback also contributes to the impact on EPS if the earnings yield and interest rate are \ndifferent. \nExhibit 8 presents a simple example with three companies that have the same earnings but trade at different \nP/E multiples. We assume they all have operating income of $95, $5 of interest income on $100 of excess cash, \npay taxes at a 20 percent rate, and have 80 shares outstanding. Each have earnings of $80 and EPS of $1.00, \nand the after-tax interest rate is 4.0 percent (0.04 = 0.05 \u00d7 (1 \u2013 .20)).  \n \n \n"

The era of easy money \nprovided low interest rates and multiples that were, for the most part, within historical norms. As a result, \nbuybacks were strongly additive for many companies.   \nTo give some sense how this driver of EPS can change, consider that the yield on BBB-rated bonds, calculated \nas the 10-year U.S. Treasury note plus the option-adjusted spread, was 2.23 percent at the end of 2020. \n"

The S&P 500 Index traded at 22.4 \ntimes the estimate of earnings at the time for 2021, or an earnings yield of 4.46 percent. A buyback for a company \nwith a profile consistent with the S&P 500 would get a boost in EPS. The magnitude of the increase is related to \nthe size of the buyback program.   \nAt the beginning of 2024, the pre-tax yield on BBB bonds was 5.17 percent and the after-tax yield was 4.14 \npercent.

A \nrepurchase program for a company with those figures would realize a slight lift to EPS but the effect would be \nclose to neutral.  \nSome of the companies with the largest buyback programs today trade at P/E multiples that make buybacks \nneutral or even slightly dilutive to EPS given current interest rates. \nExhibit 10 shows the distribution of P/E multiples, based on earnings estimates for the next four quarters, for \ncompanies in the S&P 500 at the end of January 2024.

The median multiple is well below that but about \none-third of companies in the index have a multiple that is above that level. \nBuybacks provided a lift to EPS and EPS growth because of the relationship between interest rates and P/E \nmultiples.

In theory, companies would increase their rate of \ninvestment and add financial leverage to take advantage of the lower rates. Higher investment is justified by a \nreduced cost of capital because more projects clear the hurdle to create value. More debt makes sense because \ncompanies can keep their ratios of profit to interest expense while reducing the government\u2019s claim on cash flows.   \nIn an ideal world, corporate executives would make decisions to maximize long-term value per share. But there\u2019s \na lot of evidence that they fall short of this objective for reasons that are mostly understandable.38 Executives \nare cautious, slow to change policies, and poorly calibrated. They commonly use hurdle rates that are nearly \ndouble their perceived cost of capital, maintain capital structures that are conservative, and place emphasis on \nEPS and EPS growth ahead of creating value for shareholders. Executive pay is commonly tied to earnings. \nWe separated 1996 to 2021 into two periods of equal length. We consider the latter one to be a period of easy \nmoney, as indicated by below-average interest rates. While these low rates encouraged plenty of undisciplined \nbehavior among investors and companies, the large U.S. public companies behaved in ways that were not \nconsistent with what theory would suggest (see exhibit 11). \nWe place special emphasis on share buybacks. The relationship between interest rates and market valuation \nthat prevailed during most of the era of easy money made buybacks especially useful for boosting EPS.

But low \ninterest rates, which imply low expected returns, encouraged institutional investors to take on more risk in the \npursuit of higher returns. The venture capital industry benefitted from this shift in asset allocation. Investor \ncommitments to U.S. venture capital were more than 20 percent higher in the easy money era than in the one \nthat preceded it. \nIn turn, venture capital firms accelerated their investments. Exhibit 12 shows the average annual investment \nwas $111 billion in the period of easy money, up from $45 billion in the prior period. Venture capital firms invested \n2.5 times more money, adjusted for inflation, from 2009 to 2021 versus 1996 to 2008. The annual investment in \n2000, at the apex of the dot-com boom, was not exceeded until 2018.  \nExhibit 12: U.S. Venture Capital Annual Investment, 1996-2021 \n \nSource: National Venture Capital Association and Counterpoint Global. \nThe capacity to make productive venture capital investments is limited, especially for young companies. The \nflow of venture capital encouraged companies to pursue growth. But growth is good only when the business \nmodel leads to value creation.  \nIn some cases, companies subsidized their customers to buy their good or service to become the dominant \nnetwork. Examples include industries that have two-sided networks such as ridesharing and food delivery. The \nidea is that a company can curtail subsidies once it reaches the tipping point and therefore becomes the network \nof choice for consumers. Companies such as Uber Technologies and DoorDash illustrate businesses that lost \nmoney as they sought to establish their businesses but are now profitable. \nIn other cases, companies pursued growth that exceeded organizational capacity or where the basic unit of \nanalysis, which captures how the company makes money, was flawed. Those were poor investments.
