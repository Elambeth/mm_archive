An investor should have a point of view on how \na company makes money, what opportunities exist, and the role \ncompetition might play in shaping the financial outcome. Boiled \ndown to the core, the basic unit of analysis seeks to assess \nwhether a company\u2019s investments are likely to earn a return in \nexcess of the cost of capital. \nAn investment is attractive when it has a positive net present value, \nwhich occurs when the present value of its inflows exceeds the \npresent value of the outflow. The concept applies whether it\u2019s a \nnew retail store, a research and development outlay in search of a \nviable drug, a manufacturing plant, an acquisition, or a customer \nwho transacts with a firm. The form of investment may be different, \nbut the application of the net present value rule is the same.    \nThis report focuses on the customer\n as the basic unit of analysis.1 \nThe idea of customer lifetime value (CLV) has been around for \ndecades.2 CLV equals the present value of the cash flows that a \ncustomer generates while they are engaged with the firm minus the \ncost to acquire the customer. The present value of cash flows, in \nturn, is a function of sales, costs, and customer longevity. Since the \nmid-1990s, there has been a growing emphasis on the value of \ncustomer loyalty.3 But much of this work is limited because it does \nnot tie all the way to shareholder value.4  \nDaniel McCarthy and Peter Fader, professors of marketing, have \ndeveloped a robust framework they call \u201ccustomer-based corporate \nvaluation\u201d (CBCV), which links customer economics to corporate \nvalue.5 This allows investors to build a model, based on the drivers \nof customer value from the bottom up, that generates a warranted \nstock price. It also lets investors assess what expectations for the \ndrivers of customer value are priced into a company\u2019s stock price.6 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Companies that rely primarily on subscriptions, advance \nagreements to pay for a good or service, tend to be easier to model because the key determinants of value are \ngenerally explicit. The drivers for non-subscription businesses are the same but are often trickier to assess. \nThese include customer retention, the pace of repeat purchases, and the size of orders.7 \nSales, operating costs, and investments are the fundamental building blocks of shareholder value. Sales growth \nis the most important of these for companies that are expected to earn a return on investment above the cost of \ncapital. Providing a more accurate way to forecast sales growth is one of CBCV\u2019s most significant contributions \nto the valuation literature.  \nCustomers have always been the lifeblood of corporate value. But CBCV is more important today than before \nbecause of the rise of subscription businesses. This growth has been spurred by the widespread adoption of the \nInternet in the mid-1990s and smartphones in 2007. Zuora, a subscription management platform provider, \ncalculates that the companies in its Subscription Economy Index grew revenues 17.8 percent per year from \n2012-2020, substantially outpacing the 2.0 percent rate for the S&P 500.8   \nSoftware as a service (SaaS), movie and music streaming, and e-commerce are examples of industries that \nhave emerged in recent decades. And many traditional businesses have had to adapt. For example, the New \nYork Times had weekday circulation of about 1.1 million when it launched its digital site in 1996. Today, its 5.3 \nmillion digital-only news subscribers are nearly 7 times greater than its print subscribers.9 \nIn this report, we discuss a framework for valuation, explain the elements of the CBCV model, review how \ncompanies create value, provide a case study on the postpaid segment of AT&T Mobility, examine trade-offs in \nthe drivers, and explore common errors. We believe this study is both richer and more nuanced than what many \ncompanies and analysts present.  \nFramework for Valuation \nYou can break down corporate value into two parts.10 The first reflects a continuation of the operations that the \ncompany has already established and assumes that growth creates no value. This is commonly called the \nsteady-state value. The second is based on value-creating investments the company has yet to make. This is \nreferred to as the present value of growth opportunities (PVGO). We estimate that the steady-state value has \nbeen about two-thirds of the value of the S&P 500 Index on average since 1960, with the PVGO representing \nthe other one-third.11 \nIn the context of this breakdown, we can think of current customers as the basis for the steady-state value and \nfuture customers as the source of the PVGO. Exhibit 1 shows the drivers that contribute to each component of \nvalue. Most of the value of a mature company is in the steady-state value because the firm has largely penetrated \nthe market. Most of the value of a young company is in the PVGO as the business has yet to fulfill its potential. \nIn reality, the analysis is not as tidy as this separation suggests. For example, current customers eventually \nleave and some of them return later. But this distinction does draw attention to the fact that it is inappropriate to \nextrapolate existing CLVs (the left side of exhibit 1) and to the need to focus on marginal CLVs (the right side of \nexhibit 1). \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5711735 Exp. 05/31/2024 \n5 \n \nEqually important is building a model that ultimately reflects shareholder value.15 For example, measures such \nas customer equity (CE) or the ratio of customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost (LTV/CAC) rarely \nconsider all of the relevant investments and costs, including taxes and the cost of capital. As a consequence, a \nlarge gap remains between such metrics and shareholder value. \nA comprehensive model should allow an executive or investor to calculate corporate value based on the present \nvalue of future free cash flow. Free cash flow equals net operating profit after taxes minus investments in future \ngrowth. Corporate value plus cash and other non-operating assets minus debt and other liabilities equals \nshareholder value. Most models and shorthands used in the executive and investment communities fall short of \ncapturing what ultimately matters. \nWe are now ready to turn to the core elements in the model. \nModel Elements \nWe find it useful to build the model using three related elements. The first, the bedrock, is the customers. We \nwant to consider the number of potential customers, the pattern of customer acquisition, and how long a \ncustomer is likely to stick around. The second element is revenue and revenue growth, which derives from the \ncustomer base. We want to pay particular attention to modeling customer behavior so that we can forecast \nrevenues as accurately as possible. The final element is costs. Our primary focus is on customer acquisition \ncosts, but we consider the elements of operating leverage as well. \nCustomers. Understanding the total addressable market (TAM) is a good starting point for a CBCV analysis.16 \nWe define TAM as the revenue a company would generate if it had 100 percent share of a market it could serve \nwhile creating value. TAM is not about how large a firm can be, but rather how much it can grow while adding \nvalue.  \nTAM is important because it helps quantify the size of a company\u2019s opportunity. It also allows for an assessment \nof where the company currently stands on that path to full potential. Comparing thoughtful answers to these \nquestions to what expectations are priced into a stock provides an opening for possible excess returns.  \nExhibit 3 shows the basic way to model market potential. The first part is an estimate of the total population \nseparated into customers, near customers, and those who are unlikely to become customers. Factors that make \na person less likely to transact with a firm include the cost of the service relative to disposable income, access \nto complementary devices, and demographic profile. One way to increase the TAM is to figure out how to convert \nnear customers, who are close to buying the good or service, into customers. Population growth and access to \nglobal markets mean that the TAM can increase over time. \nThe next part is product adoption. This includes the adoption rate of the good or service and, more significantly, \ncompetition. Large and lucrative markets attract rivals. Rivalry has countervailing effects on a market. On the \none hand, competitors tend to draw resources to the market. That accelerates adoption. The ride share market \nis a good illustration. Competition led to more promotional activity, which lowered the cost for customers and \nraised the rate of adoption. \nOn the other hand, competition tends to hurt profitability in the short run. The same promotions that generate \ncustomer growth also penalize CLV through lower profits and higher CACs.   \n"

This captures how often customers engage with the company and how much \nthey spend when they do transact. Some businesses see their customers increase their spending for subsequent \npurchases after their first purchase, while others realize a decrease. Behavior is more predictable for \nsubscription businesses, where the customer pays a set amount at a specified time for access to a good or \nservice, than for non-subscription businesses where transactions are at the discretion of the buyer. \nExhibit 3: Components of Total Addressable Market Forecast \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nEverett Rogers was a sociologist who did foundational work on the diffusion of innovation. He created a \ntaxonomy of adopters, from \u201cinnovators\u201d to \u201claggards\u201d (see exhibit 4). Rogers noted that the number of categories \nand the size of each were choices. But the basic idea is that an individual\u2019s category reflects when he or she \naccepts a new innovation relative to other adopters. Note that in Rogers\u2019s model, the innovators and early \nadopters combined are only 16 percent of the total potential market and an equivalent percentage are laggards.17 \nGeoffrey Moore, an organizational theorist and consultant who also happens to have a PhD in English literature, \nsuggests that many products or services fail to transition from the early adopters to the early majority. He calls \nthat phase \u201ccrossing the chasm.\u201d18     \nUnderstanding where a company or industry is on the adoption curve is important because both CAC and cash \nflows can change as a company\u2019s customer base grows. You can imagine that the innovators, a group Moore \nevocatively calls \u201centhusiasts,\u201d have little or no CAC and generate good cash flows. But as you move through \nthe adopter groups, the cost to bring in customers can rise and the proclivity of those customers to spend can \nfall relative to the early adopters. These tried and true models show why it is a mistake to assume customers \nare a homogenous bunch.19     \nCustomers\nTotal \naddressable \nmarket\nNear-\ncustomers\nPotential \nTAM\nNon-\ncustomers\nPopulation\n\u2022 Can we convert \nnear-customers?\nCompetitor 2\nNon-\ncustomers\nProduct\n\u2022 Are the resources committed to \nthe category accelerating growth?\n\u2022 Is competition hurting profitability?\nCompetitor 3\nMarket \nshare\nCompetitor 1\nOrder   \nfrequency\nX\nBasket            \nsize\n=\nRevenues\nPurchase\n\u2022 Can we anticipate customer behavior?\n\u2022 What can we do to increase frequency \nand/or magnitude of purchase?\nNear-\ncustomers\n"

But these \nshortcomings are offset by insights gained from understanding the number of potential customers and how they \nmight engage with the firm. For instance, researchers have drawn a link between word of mouth marketing, \nrelated to the coefficient of imitation, and customer lifetime value.26   \nWith a sense of the number of potential customers and the likelihood they will engage with a good or service, \nwe turn to the issue of customer retention.

Longevity is useful to consider in \nthe context of the payback period, the time it takes for the present value of customer cash flows to equal the \ncustomer acquisition cost.

The customers that remain are the good customers \nand hence may not be suitable proxies for new ones. For this reason, older companies have lower churn, on \naverage, than younger ones do.  \nExhibit 9 shows the monthly churn for a handful of industries. The median for these industries is 5.5 percent, \nwith a low of 4.6 percent for software as a service and a high of 10.8 percent for subscription-based video on \ndemand (SVOD), which is delivered without a cable or satellite subscription, or \u201cover the top\u201d (OTT).  \nExhibit 9: Monthly Churn Rate for a Handful of Industries \n \nSource: Recurly Research. \nNote: Analysis of over 1,500 subscription sites processing subscription billing on the Recurly platform from January-\nDecember 2019.   \nThe churn rate is relevant only in the context of the other drivers of CLV, including the cash flows the customer \ngenerates while active and the customer acquisition cost. But it makes clear why looking at the number of \ncustomers over time is insufficient to understand the prospects for value creation.  \nImagine that company A and company B both report 1,000 customers at the end of one quarter and 1,100 at the \nend of the next one. On the surface they look the same, having grown their customer bases by 10 percent. But \nnow consider that company A had a 10 percent churn rate and company B had a 30 percent rate.

It is often the case that customers spend more the longer they stay. One \ndramatic example is Coupang, a Korean e-commerce company, which revealed the spending of its cohorts over \ntime (see exhibit 10). A cohort is defined as a group of buyers who made their first purchase within a specific \nperiod. To illustrate, the cohort from calendar 2016 collectively spent nearly 3.6 times more four years later than \nthey did in the initial year, despite those customers who left. Increased sales per customer correlates with \nincreased profit per customer assuming that the company\u2019s cost structure is partially fixed. \nExhibit 10: Coupang, Inc.: Spending by Cohort, Indexed to Year 1 \nYear \n1  \n2  \n3  \n4  \n5  \nCohort \n2016  \n1.00x \n1.37x \n1.80x \n2.37x \n3.59x \n2017  \n1.00x \n1.80x \n2.35x \n3.46x \n  \n2018  \n1.00x \n1.98x \n3.06x \n  \n  \n2019  \n1.00x \n2.19x \n  \n  \n  \nSource: Coupang, Inc., S-1 Filing, February 12, 2021. \nExhibit 11 summarizes the academic research about the variables that determine churn rate for contractual \nfirms.

Companies and investors sometimes \nassume a constant retention rate for a pool of customers acquired in the same period. This can lead to an \nundervaluation of the cohort by 25-50 percent.36 A more typical pattern is a retention rate below the average in \nearly periods following acquisition and above the average for subsequent periods (see exhibit 13). In other \nwords, a customer is more likely to leave early than late.    \nExhibit 13: Retention Curves Are Rarely Constant \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global.  \nThe middle panel of exhibit 12 shows total orders.

While CLV is often cited as a fixed \nsum, in reality there is often a great deal of variance around the average.39 Indeed, customer behavior can be \nvery skewed. One academic study found that the top 20 percent of customers generated 67 percent of the \nrevenues for a sample of nearly 340 public companies.40 Further, non-subscription businesses realized \nsubstantially higher revenues from their best customers than subscription businesses did. In general, the \ndistribution of CLVs is lopsided, with most customers adding little value and a handful creating a lot. \nThe ideal is to calibrate the parameters that drive value to understand a company\u2019s value. These parameters \ninclude the rate and cost of customer acquisition, churn rate, order frequency, and basket size. The patterns of \ntransactions are complicated for non-subscription businesses in large part because it is harder to observe and \nanticipate behavior. As a consequence, non-subscription businesses can be mispriced by the stock market and \nprovide astute management teams with an opportunity to build value through customer-focused programs.41 \nCosts. So far, we have focused on a company\u2019s revenue potential, which considers a company\u2019s current and \nfuture customers and how much they will spend. But to calculate shareholder value we also need to account for \ncosts.  \nThe most prominent of these is the customer acquisition cost (CAC), which can be linked to firm value.42 \nCompanies and investors commonly estimate CAC as sales and marketing expense divided by the number of \nnew customers. For example, Netflix, Inc., which provides a subscription-based online video streaming service, \nhad marketing expense of about $2.2 billion and acquired around 29 million customers in the 12 months ended \nMarch 31, 2021.

This \nmeans that there are diminishing returns to acquiring customers, as with most economic activities. Exhibit 15 \nshows the upward trend in CACs for business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies.  \nExhibit 15: Change in Customer Acquisition Costs Over Time \n \nSource: Neel Desai, \u201cHow Is CAC Changing Over Time?\u201d ProfitWell, August 14, 2019. \nEmpirical data shows that CACs also tend to be higher for industries with a large number of competitors than \nfor industries with a small number. By contrast, retention cost per customer remains relatively stable whether \nthe number of competitors is small or large.  \nCAC can decrease for a business that enjoys a network effect, which exists when the value of a good or service \nincreases as more people use that good or service.44 This can happen even as the willingness to pay (WTP), \nthe most a customer would pay for a good or service, increases. Lower CAC and higher WTP generally occur \nonly when one network becomes dominant. The business that controls the network benefits from economies of \nscale on the supply-side, where costs decline as a function of sales, and the demand-side, where WTP increases \nas a function of sales.45 \nAcademics distinguish between a few kinds of network effects. Direct network effects exist when the participants \ncan connect with one another without an intermediary. Telephone networks are the classic example. Indirect \nnetwork effects exist when there\u2019s a complementary asset involved. Video game consoles and video games are \na clear illustration. Network effects are also relevant for platform businesses that match two sides of a market. \nThe ride-sharing companies are a good case in point.46   \nGoing from revenue to shareholder value requires reflecting all costs (see exhibit 16).

In the late 1990s, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged that America \nOnline, Inc. (AOL), then the leading retail internet service provider, had violated generally accepted accounting \nprinciples by capitalizing and amortizing customer acquisition costs. For fiscal 1996, AOL\u2019s adjustment reduced \npretax losses to $68 million from $175 million.

Very little has changed since that time, which means that companies and \ninvestors have to dig into the financial statements to understand the basic unit of analysis.   \nGeoffrey West, a theoretical physicist who was the president and is now a distinguished professor at the Santa \nFe Institute, discusses the sigmoidal pattern of growth that applies to mammals and companies.49 Consider an \nanimal. Energy, via metabolism, is devoted to growth and maintenance. At birth, nearly all of the energy goes \ntoward growth and little to maintenance. But as the body grows, the mix shifts from growth to maintenance until \nnearly all of the energy is devoted to maintenance. Growth finishes at the point of maturity. \nCompanies follow a similar pattern, with energy replaced by cost. For customer-based companies, growth is \nakin to acquiring new customers via customer acquisition costs and maintenance is keeping customers through \nretention spending.  \nCompanies that spend too little on acquiring customers in the growth phase limit their ultimate size, whereas \ncompanies that spend too much once mature waste resources. One study of retailers found those that continued \nto invest in new stores in pursuit of growth after diminishing returns had set in generated much lower returns to \nshareholders than those that recognized the limits to incremental spending. \u201cCuring the addiction to growth\u201d is \nessential to creating shareholder value.50  \nHow Companies Add Value  \nAdam Brandenburger and Harborne Stuart, professors who study competitive strategy, have described a simple \nmodel of value creation from the point of view of buyers, the firm, and suppliers.51 There are four numbers to \nconsider. The first is willingness to pay (WTP), the maximum a customer would pay for a good or service.52 The \nsecond is the price the firm charges for that good or service. The difference between WTP and price is consumer \nsurplus. The third is the cost to the firm to deliver the product. The gap between price and cost is the firm\u2019s value \ncreation. The final figure is willingness to sell (WTS), the minimum a supplier would accept to provide a good or \nservice. Suppliers include employees.53 Cost minus WTS reflects a supplier surplus. \nFelix Oberholzer-Gee, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, enriches the \nBrandenburger and Stuart framework by providing specific methods to increase WTP or decrease WTS, hence \nproviding the firm with an opportunity to create more value.54 Exhibit 17 shows the framework and adds \nOberholzer-Gee\u2019s observations about how to pursue a value-creating strategy.   \n \n \n \n"

Oberholzer-Gee suggests that companies should \nfocus less on how to create more sales and more on how to delight their customers so as to increase WTP. This \nis important because the research suggests that higher consumer surplus leads to higher customer retention, \nhence linking directly to the calculation of CLV.55 We briefly describe the levers he discusses to increase WTP: \n\u2022 Products and services. Companies can increase WTP by earning a reputation of always placing the \nbest interests of the customer first, reducing friction so as to create new opportunities, and considering \ncarefully the needs of both the consumers and the intermediaries. Near customers are a group that has \na WTP below the price of a company\u2019s offering. It is worth considering why these customers don\u2019t \npurchase a company\u2019s products and whether there are cost-effective ways to expand the total \naddressable market by gaining access to them. A central element of the theory of disruptive innovation \nis that there is a segment of the market that the incumbents are unwilling or unable to serve.56  \nReducing search costs is another way to boost WTP. Experiments show that recommendation engines, \npopular on e-commerce and video streaming sites, have an effect on WTP.57 There is positive feedback \nbetween purchases and data. The more information a company has about purchase habits, the better it \ncan customize recommendations, leading to further sales.

But it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell the \ndifference. One example is whether the digital form of a newspaper or magazine is a complement to, or \na substitute for, the printed version. A marketer can gain insight into complementarity by studying the \npatterns of usage, examining the trends over time, and running experiments to sort cause and effect. \n\u2022 Network effects. We already mentioned network effects in the discussion of CAC. Once a particular \nnetwork becomes dominant, it shifts the demand curve up and increases WTP.59 In cases where a \ncompany does not change the price of its good or service, consumer surplus increases. Some social \nmedia sites are free to consumers but generate revenues via advertising. In cases where network effects \nare present, the value of advertising mirrors WTP and the company can often monetize the gains \nbecause the companies auction the right to advertise. \nSome companies can create network effects by serving a subset of a broader group of potential \ncustomers. Dating sites that serve individuals of a particular religion, educational status, or vocation are \nexamples. But executives and investors should be careful about network effects. Strong network effects \nare less prevalent than asserted, and many platform-based networks can suffer from an imbalance \nbetween the sides. For instance, you can imagine a dating website that has too many men and too few \nwomen, or the opposite situation. \nThe notion of WTP is relevant for all facets of customer lifetime value. Ways to capture near customers can \nincrease the total addressable market. And increasing WTP creates the potential for pricing power, which lifts \nthe value per customer, or generates consumer surplus, which leads to higher retention.60 A decrease in WTP \nhas the opposite effect. It trims TAM, weakens pricing power, and encourages churn.  \nWe\u2019ll now drop down to the bottom of the exhibit and review WTS and cost. To start, it is worth noting that \neconomies of scale, the idea that the cost per unit declines as output rises, is relevant for most industries. These \ninclude businesses such as semiconductor and automobile manufacturing. Size matters in many cases. \nChallengers face the daunting task of achieving minimum efficient scale, the smallest volume necessary to \nachieve unit costs that are competitive with the incumbents.  \nCompanies want to maximize their value and often see reducing cost as a means to do that. Suppliers want to \nmaximize their value, which is the difference between cost and WTS. These goals may conflict with one another.  \nWhat companies often overlook is the possibility that they can lower their own cost and preserve value for their \nsuppliers by lowering WTS, the price at which suppliers are willing to sell. The situation goes from being zero \nsum to win-win. There a number of ways to assess the potential for decreasing WTS. Here are a couple:     \n\u2022 Reduce supply cost through data. Leading digital companies gather a substantial amount of data \nabout their customers, including their preferences and purchase habits. Sharing this information can \nlower a supplier\u2019s WTS. Say a supplier today earns a 12.5 percent profit margin (net operating profit \nafter taxes \u00f7 sales) and has 1.2x capital turnover (sales \u00f7 invested capital) for a return on invested capital \n(ROIC) of 15 percent (12.5% \u2715 1.2 = 15.0%). Now let\u2019s assume that a company provides detailed data \nthat help the supplier lower its invested capital, increasing its capital turnover to 2.0x. That supplier could \nnow lower its product price to the equivalent of a 7.5 percent profit margin while still earning a 15 percent \nROIC (7.5% \u2715 2.0 = 15.0%). Even better, the supplier can lower the price to a 10 percent margin, which \ncreates value for the firm and surplus for the supplier.   \n\u2022 Productivity. Our focus here is mostly on employees. There are two ways you can potentially create \nmore supplier surplus, or employee satisfaction. The first is to pay them more. This redistributes value \nfrom the company to the employees unless there are offsets such as lower employee turnover. But the \n"

Autonomy is the feeling of being in control \nand includes elements such as options for which tasks to pursue, flexible hours, openness as to various \ntechniques to solve problems, and the opportunity to work with a good team. Mastery means the job \nclosely matches the employee\u2019s abilities with the opportunity to grow and improve. A sense of purpose \nis about serving a broader objective such that an employee\u2019s efforts contribute to a greater good. \nEmployees who are intrinsically motivated require fair pay, but employers can create a lot of productivity \nand employee surplus by fostering a great culture. Indeed, 75 percent of millennial employees, those \nborn from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, said they would take a pay cut in order to work for a company \nthat is socially responsible.64  \nData also plays a role with employees. For example, service companies that understand product \ndemand can match work schedules to staff appropriately. This saves the company money and makes \nemployees happier. For example, research shows that the flexibility that Uber drivers have creates twice \nas much surplus as schedules that are less flexible.65  \nWTS is important for customer lifetime value because it relates to both price and cost. A company with happy \nemployees is likely to provide its customers with a better experience, both encouraging customer adoption and \nfostering retention. Lowering WTS can be mutually beneficial to firms and their suppliers. A thorough assessment \nof CLV considers how companies add value and the creative ways that companies can increase consumer and \nsupplier surplus along the way. \nWe now turn to a case study to make this analysis more concrete.   \nCase Study \u2013 AT&T Mobility \nDan McCarthy, one of the progenitors of customer-based corporate valuation, started his career as an \ninvestment analyst. This means that he understands how to model the value of a business. In late 2020, he \nshared a case study of AT&T Mobility, a leading provider of wireless telecommunications in the United States.66 \nThis division makes up the majority of AT&T\u2019s enterprise value. AT&T Mobility has postpaid and prepaid \nbusinesses. We focus on the postpaid business, which is the bigger of the two.     \nExhibit 18 closely mirrors exhibit 1 but fills the boxes with the appropriate figures. McCarthy\u2019s analysis suggests \na value of the business of $543 billion, which excludes a number of costs. The value is closer to $200 billion \nafter all costs, taxes, and investments are considered.  \nWe see immediately that the value of the business is split roughly equally between the present value of existing \ncustomers and the present value of future customers. This breakdown of value reflects where a business is in \nits lifecycle: the value for companies early in their lifecycle is concentrated in future customers and the value for \ncompanies late in their lifecycle is predominately in existing customers.   \n \n \n \n"

First, this analysis suggests that the number of present customers, 76.2 million, is less \nthan the number of potential future customers of 97.8 million. (Some past or current customers that churn may \nbe included in the sum of future customers.) The ratio between present and future customers needs to be viewed \nin the context of market size, competition, and the age of the offering.  \nSecond, the value per new customer is modestly lower than that for existing customers, but acquiring new \ncustomers requires a customer acquisition cost. The CAC of $500 reduces the value per new customer to \n$2,838, nearly 20 percent below that of existing customers. As companies move through the various adopter \ncategories, it is common for CAC to drift up and the value per new customer to drift down. \nFinally, this model assumes that new customers will generate slightly higher ARPU but will stay for a shorter \nperiod. Recall that retention is often higher for seasoned cohorts because the least loyal customers have already \nchurned and those left are among the most loyal.       \nIn this case, McCarthy models only the variable costs. When he considers all costs and the cash flows are \ndiscounted to a present value, the net value per customer is 35-40 percent of what exhibit 18 shows and value \nof this business is around $200 billion. This is consistent with the sum-of-the-parts analysis by investors in the \nfinancial community. \nWhile this analysis based on quality inputs and a sound model, it is important to recognize the probabilistic \nnature of the forecasts and the limitations of the model. As a consequence, sensitivity analysis is required to \nunderstand the impact that different assumptions have on value. It is very important to consider each variable in \nthe context of the whole model. \nTrade-Offs and Sensitivity Analysis \nCustomers, revenues, and costs are the core drivers in the CBCV model. It is essential to consider how they \ninteract when assessing how various assumptions affect value. Specifically, there are trade-offs between the \ndrivers. For example, a price increase grows cash flow but raises the churn rate. A price drop shrinks cash flow \nbut lowers the churn rate. A focus on new customer acquisition increases the number of customers but raises \nacquisition costs. A focus on retaining current customers lowers churn but increases retention costs.   \nThe key to sorting through these possibilities is to do sensitivity analysis and to run scenarios. For example, in \nJanuary 2019 Netflix raised the price of its basic service 13 percent, its standard service 18 percent, and its \npremium service 14 percent. TDG Research asked 469 users what they would do if the price went up and found \n10 percent said they would downgrade to a cheaper plan and 12 percent said they would cancel the service \noutright.67 Essentially the increase pushed the price above the willingness to pay for a subset of customers.  \nPeople may not do what they said they would do in a survey. But modeling the potential revenue and profit \nincreases from remaining customers and offsetting them with a loss of customers can help measure the impact \non value. As an illustration, assume a company has 1,000 customers with a current CLV of $500. The firm \ndecides to raise prices, lifting the CLV to $600 for those customers who remain. The company comes out ahead \nif it loses fewer than 166 customers ($600 \u2715 [1,000 \u2013 166] \u2248 $500,000). The trade-off is between the size of the \nprice increase and the number of customers who defect. Likewise, a company that lowers its price can expect \nto keep more customers or add new ones at a faster clip.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n5711735 Exp. 05/31/2024 \n27 \n \nAnother trade-off is between spending money to acquire new customers and retaining existing ones. Marketing \nresearchers point out a handful of mistakes that companies make when faced with this decision.68 The first is \nfailing to consider the law of diminishing returns when assessing how much to spend on acquisition and retention. \nThe problem is that both must be considered on the margin, and the marginal cost and benefit is likely to be less \ncompelling than the average of the past. \nAnother mistake is dwelling too much on short-term versus long-term metrics. Some customers, for example, \nare relatively inexpensive to acquire but expensive to retain. Acquiring this group looks good in the short run but \nimpedes long-term profitability. Other customers are expensive to acquire but cheap to retain. They appear \ncostly in the short term but create a lot of value in the long run.  \nThe third mistake is treating acquisition and retention strategies separately, rather than integrating them into a \nframework to maximize long-term value. When different groups within a company focus on acquisition and \nretention, they can make decisions at cross-purposes. Indeed, companies with generous marketing budgets \noften overspend on both strategies. \nThe final mistake is overlooking selection bias as the result of survivorship. If a company relies too much on the \ndata from its current customers, it is drawing inferences from a sample that is not representative of potential \ncustomers.  \nThese marketing researchers built a statistical model to assess the trade-off between acquisition and retention \nspending that considers these potential pitfalls. Exhibit 21 shows one of their simplified case studies based on \na pharmaceutical company. The columns are various levels of retention spending, the rows are acquisition \nspending, and the figures in the table are the average customer profitability based on the combinations.    \nExhibit 21: Quantifying the Trade-Off Between Acquisition and Retention Spending \nRetention Spending \n$40  \n$50  \n$60  \n$70  \n$80  \nAcquisition \nSpending \n$1  \n$1,423 \n$1,543 \n$1,583 \n$1,543 \n$1,423 \n$5  \n$1,437 \n$1,557 \n$1,597 \n$1,557 \n$1,437 \n$10  \n$1,443 \n$1,563 \n$1,603 \n$1,563 \n$1,443 \n$15  \n$1,437 \n$1,557 \n$1,597 \n$1,557 \n$1,437 \n$20  \n$1,418 \n$1,538 \n$1,578 \n$1,538 \n$1,418 \nSource: Jacquelyn S.

It is worth taking a moment to highlight common errors that we see in the \nanalysis of CLV: \n\u2022 Assuming stable churn. Retention rates generally follow a curve, and the average of a cohort can lead \nto an improper valuation. Further, retention rates can vary from one cohort to the next, making too much \nreliance on past averages troublesome.  \n\u2022 Assuming customer homogeneity. The types of customers that engage with a company tend to \nchange over time as the result of factors such as which adopter category they are in and competition. \nFurther, the economic value created by current customers tends to be very skewed as a small \npercentage of customers create a large percentage of value.   \n\u2022 Assuming CAC does not change. Companies always have to think about CAC for the next customer. \nIn general, CAC tends to rise because the most enthusiastic people become customers early and the \nmore skeptical customers are converted later. The exception to a rising CAC is when network effects \nare sufficient to make one business dominant. For these types of businesses, spending on CAC is high \nand rising until the business reaches a tipping point and becomes the de facto standard. Then \nincremental CAC declines sharply. \n\u2022 Failure to discount future cash flows. Some companies and investors present future cash flows \nwithout discounting them to a present value. This has the obvious effect of overstating customer lifetime \nvalue.  \n\u2022 Failure to model all the way from sales to shareholder value. Blunt measures such as LTV/CAC \n(customer lifetime value \u00f7 customer acquisition cost) fail to reflect meaningful determinants of \nshareholder value, including taxes and investments. The virtue of customer-based corporate valuation \n(CBCV) is that it considers all of the drivers of shareholder value. \nWe should also note that while customer-based corporate valuation is a powerful way to value a business, \ncorporate disclosure is very inconsistent.70 Companies leave out key data, define terms in various ways, or even \nprovide misleading figures. Transparency about the drivers of customer value has improved but has a ways to \ngo. \nConclusion \nCompanies and investors can consider the customer as the basic unit of analysis in understanding value. The \nrise of digitalization in the economy has allowed companies to gather unprecedented amounts of data on their \ncustomers and their behavior, permitting an assessment of overall value based on granular statistics. The \nconcept of customer lifetime value (CLV), driven by customers, sales, and costs has been around for more than \na quarter century. That work was led by professors of marketing and consultants.  \nThese tools are extremely valuable, but areas of potential improvement remain. The first is the introduction of \nmore sophisticated statistical models to predict revenue through customer acquisition, churn rate, purchase \nfrequency, and basket size. The second is a reckoning for all costs that allow the model to go from revenue to \nshareholder value.   \nCustomer-based corporate valuation (CBCV) improves on the classic model by filling in those gaps. The work \ncombines foundational work from marketing and finance to provide companies and investors with the tools to \nmake informed decisions.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n5711735 Exp. 05/31/2024 \n29 \n \nWe discuss the key elements of CBCV, including customers, revenues, and costs and show how to model them \nusing a cohort model. The accuracy of the inputs varies based on the information companies share and whether \nthe business is based on subscriptions or non-subscriptions. But in any case, a thorough understanding of the \nmodel prompts the right questions. \nA company\u2019s value creation opportunity can be framed by the concept of willingness to pay and willingness to \nsell. We review some strategies companies can pursue to create consumer or supplier surplus. The important \npoint is these strategies can avoid actions that are zero sum, where the company benefits at the expense of its \ncustomers or suppliers. This work also reveals the existence of near-customers and provides companies with a \nway to think about accessing that group to increase the total addressable market. \nA case study of AT&T Mobility shows how these concepts work. The model parameters are tuned to get a very \ngood fit with past results and to provide confidence in the forecasts. The case does not go down to shareholder \nvalue because it focuses on a division of AT&T. But we know that sales growth is commonly the most important \nvalue trigger. \nFinally, this discussion is incomplete without recognizing that companies have to make trade-offs as they allocate \ncorporate resources. Drivers such as price and churn, and new customer acquisition and customer retention, \ncan have countervailing effects on value. Companies and investors have to assess those trade-offs and do \nproper sensitivity analysis to fully understand the implications for value. \nNotwithstanding large strides in improving our understanding of CLV, companies and investors still make some \nbasic errors. It is useful to bear in mind that shorthands are generally effective at saving time but also come with \nblind spots. The key is to dig deep enough to understand the fundamental drivers of value. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5711735 Exp. 05/31/2024 \n30 \n \nAppendix: Financing Software as a Service Businesses \nThe potential growth of software as a service (SaaS) businesses is affected by countervailing forces. On the \none hand, the digital nature of the service means that the companies can grow rapidly. On the other hand, many \nsubscription businesses have high upfront costs and customer cash flows that take years to pay off. That means \nthat fast growth, even for businesses with excellent customer economics, requires a lot of capital in the short \nrun. \nSaaS companies have a few ways to access the necessary capital. The first is through raising debt or equity. \nMany of these companies seek additional equity because they are young. Venture capitalists and growth equity \ninvestors are the natural providers of this capital. The concern is that raising additional equity capital dilutes the \nfounders and early investors, leaving them with a smaller percentage ownership of the firm. Of course, such a \ncapital raise is desirable if the new capital adds more value than it causes in dilution. \nAnother alternative is stock-based (SBC) compensation. Here, the company pays its employees using various \nforms of equity including restricted stock units, performance stock units, and employee stock options. SBC is \nbasically two transactions in one. In the first the company sells shares, a form of financing, and in the second it \ncompensates its employees for their service. You can think of SBC as the equivalent of the company selling  \nstock to outside investors and using the proceeds to pay employees.  \nAccountants reverse the expense for SBC when they calculate the cash flows from operations on the statement \nof cash flows. We calculate that SBC represented 50 percent of the $25.6 billion in cash flow from operations in \n2020 for the top 50 SaaS companies as measured by market capitalization.71 Said differently, cash flow from \noperations would be one-half of what the companies reported, with an offsetting increase in cash flows from \nfinancing activities, if SBC were removed. \nA new means to access capital has emerged recently. For example, Pipe is a finance company that advances \ncash against annual recurring revenue (ARR). SaaS companies commonly sign multi-year deals but boost their \nshort-term cash flows by offering their customers a discount to pay upfront. Pipe evaluates a SaaS company\u2019s \nmain metrics and, if it qualifies, helps match the company with an investor that is willing exchange cash (90-95 \npercent of annual contract value, on average) in return for the cash flow. The SaaS company can then use that \ncash to pursue additional customers. Assuming the SaaS company is allocating capital well, this financing \nmechanism circumvents the need to raise debt or equity capital.72  \nRisk and expected reward for an investor is a function of the order in which capital providers get paid. Equity \ncapital has the highest risk and reward because it is a residual claim, which means that all other capital providers \nare satisfied first. Debt has a lower cost than equity because debt holders get paid before equity holders and \nare senior in the capital structure. Claims on revenues are the least risky because they are first in line.  \nSwapping ARRs for cash makes sense for companies and exiting investors if the proceeds are deployed well. \nBut there is no free lunch. Equity investors should acknowledge that the introduction of a party that has claims \non revenues increases the risk for the other capital providers.   \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 36-38 \n \n  \n \n"

Common techniques \ninclude surveys, conjoint analysis (a more structured form of survey), auctions, and experiments. For more on \nthis, see Tim Stobierski, \u201cWillingness to Pay: What It Is and How to Calculate It,\u201d Harvard Business School \nOnline, October 20, 2020 at https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/willingness to pay.  \nA consumer should in theory provide the same figure for WTP and willingness to accept (WTA), the amount an \nindividual would accept to not use a product or service. But surveys often show a large gap between the two. \nCass Sunstein, a professor at Harvard Law School, surveyed individuals in 2018 about their per month WTP \nand WTA for a handful of social media platforms. Here are the results:  \nAverage \nAverage  \nRatio of \nPlatform \nWTP \nWTA \nWTA/WTP \nWhatsApp \n$34.90 \n$101.16 \n2.9 \nReddit \n27.73 \n97.73 \n3.5 \nLinkedIn \n25.71 \n97.80 \n3.8 \nSnapchat \n24.92 \n106.20 \n4.3 \nInstagram \n21.67 \n102.60 \n4.7 \nPinterest \n20.97 \n102.92 \n4.9 \nTwitter \n19.94 \n104.18 \n5.2 \nYouTube \n17.27 \n90.78 \n5.3 \nFacebook \n16.99 \n89.17 \n5.2 \nThat the WTA is roughly three to five times higher than the WTP is evidence of the endowment effect, the idea \nthat people place a greater value on what they own than what they do not own. Indeed, the size of the ratio \ncompelled Sunstein to call it a \u201csuperendowment effect.\u201d See Cass R. Sunstein, Too Much Information: \nUnderstanding What You Don\u2019t Want to Know (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2020), 138-141. \n53 Brandenburger and Stuart used the term \u201copportunity cost\u201d rather than \u201cwillingness to sell.\u201d But the concepts \nare the same.  \n54 Oberholzer-Gee, Better, Simpler Strategy. This concept also appears to fit well with the two \u201crules\u201d that guide \ncompanies to create sustainable value: \u201cbetter before cheaper\u201d (compete on differentiators other than price) and \n\u201crevenue before cost\u201d (prioritize increasing revenue over lowering cost).
