Feedback, defined as information \nused as a basis for improvement, is central to making the process \nmore effective. In this report, we discuss multiple facets of process \nimprovement, including getting the right people and helping them \nthrive, the role of organizational structure in fostering good decision \nmaking, and specific mechanisms to create feedback that \nsharpens execution (see exhibit 1).

You then \nneed to train them to be effective, figure out how you should deploy their skills, and institute a policy of practice.  \nFinding individuals that are likely to add value to an organization is an essential activity that is rarely done as \nwell as it could be. How do you find the right people? The first step is to identify the skills that can lead to success.  \nA recent discussion with an executive at a National Football League team made this point. The team first \nassessed which skills, typically around a half dozen per position, it deemed necessary to succeed. Identifying \nthese skills helps in drafting new players, evaluating the current roster, and acquiring players through trades or \nfree agency.   \nAnother important aspect of identification is determining which skills can be improved through coaching and \norganizational support and which cannot. Players generally follow a performance curve, which includes gains \nuntil the age of peak performance and declines following it. But some abilities, including speed and throwing \naccuracy, are difficult to modify at any point. The team\u2019s front office tried to isolate which skills it could strengthen \nand sought to build processes to capture the opportunity.1  \nWhat skills are valuable for investing? We believe that two areas of research in psychology, one on \nsuperforecasters and the other on the rationality quotient (RQ), identify characteristics that are associated with \nsuccessful long-term investment results. There is substantial overlap in the qualities of superforecasters and \nindividuals who have a high RQ.  \nSuperforecasters. In the fall of 2011, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), an agency \nwithin the U.S. intelligence community, launched a tournament to see if there might be a way to improve \nforecasts of social, political, and economic outcomes.  \nA team of psychologists, including Philip Tetlock, Barbara Mellers, and Don Moore, created the Good Judgment \nProject (GJP), one of a handful of teams seeking to answer these questions accurately. The GJP was the best \nof the teams and purportedly outperformed members of the intelligence community.2 \nThe researchers found that about two percent of the thousands of volunteers that the GJP recruited delivered a \nlot of good projections. The accuracy of their forecasts was beyond what chance alone would dictate.3 Tetlock \nand his colleagues called these people \u201csuperforecasters.\u201d \nBecause this was a research project, the GJP team also sought to understand what led to good forecasts. They \nexamined the traits of the forecasters, measured the impact of training, and assessed the value of working in \nteams versus individually.  \nSuperforecasters and successful investors share a lot of the same qualities. They seek to anticipate outcomes \nin a probabilistic world by understanding what has happened in the past, properly updating their views to reflect \nnew information, and working hard. These skills do not come naturally to many, and the research suggests that \nhow we think is more important than what we think.  \nBeyond a commitment to learning and engagement, superforecasters share some common characteristics (see \nexhibit 2). It takes little effort to see how these concepts apply to investors. The first is philosophical approach \nand outlook. This requires being comfortable with the sense of doubt and recognizing that degrees of doubt are \na better way to approach problems than settling on certainty. Humility stems from a recognition that the world is \n"

Finally, superforecasters don\u2019t believe what happened had to happen and are \nopen to considering counterfactuals. \nThe second set of characteristics has to do with ability and thinking style. This starts with being actively open-\nminded, a willingness to consider a conclusion different from the one you currently hold.4 People who score well \non the actively open-minded scale tend to be less susceptible to cognitive biases.5 Tetlock and Dan Gardner, \nhis co-author of the book Superforecasting, write, \u201cBeliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be \nprotected.\u201d6 Intellectual curiosity and numeracy are also essential elements of thinking style. \nMethods of forecasting are the third suite of characteristics. Here, the big ideas are to think in probabilities and \nto update views as new information is revealed. This is difficult in the face of confirmation bias, which is one of \nthe most potent cognitive challenges. Confirmation bias is present when we process information to favor opinions \nthat we hold in high esteem and with great conviction.7 Unlike other biases, confirmation bias does not lessen \nwith high intelligence.8 \nThe ability to communicate well is another important characteristic of an investor. You don\u2019t really understand \nan idea unless you can communicate it clearly in speech or the written word.   \nExhibit 2: Characteristics of Good Forecasters \nPhilosophical Approach and Outlook \nCautious \nUnderstand few things are certain \nHumble \nAppreciate their limits \nNondeterministic \nDon't assume that what happens is meant to be \nAbilities and Thinking Styles  \nOpen-Minded \nSee beliefs as hypotheses to be tested \nInquiring \nAre intellectually curious and enjoy mental challenges \nReflective \nAre introspective and self-critical \nNumerate \nAre comfortable with numbers \nMethods of Forecasting  \nPragmatic \nNot wedded to any one idea or agenda \nAnalytical \nConsider other views \nSynthesizing \nBlend diverse views into their own \nProbability-Focused \nJudge the probability of events not as certain or uncertain but as more or less \nlikely \nThoughtful Updaters \nChange their minds when new facts warrant it \nIntuitive Shrinks \nAre aware of their cognitive and emotional biases \nWork Ethic \n  \nImprovement-Minded \nStrive to get better \nTenacious \nStick with a problem for as long as needed \n \nSource: Paul J.H.

Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between intelligence quotient (IQ) \nand stock market participation and results.9 The second area of research is on the \u201crationality quotient,\u201d or RQ, \na measure of rational decision making.10 This idea was developed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich, Richard \nWest, and Maggie Toplak. While intelligence quotient, or IQ, is correlated with RQ, \u201c[t]he magnitude of the \ncorrelation leaves plenty of room for disassociations between intelligence and rationality.\u201d11 As with the \ncharacteristics of superforecasters, how people think is more important than raw measures of intelligence. \nIQ is an estimate of where a person falls on a scale of general intelligence (g). Standardized tests such as the \nSAT, historically used as part of an assessment for college admissions, are a good proxy for g.12 In turn, g is \ncommonly characterized with fluid and crystalized components. Fluid intelligence measures reasoning in novel \ndomains. Crystalized intelligence is declarative knowledge. Fluid intelligence peaks on average at an age in the \nearly 20s, while crystalized intelligence tends to rise through most of one\u2019s life. Fluid intelligence measures a \nprocess while crystalized intelligence reflects stored knowledge.  \nCognitive scientists use the term \u201crationality\u201d in a normative sense, which means how you ought to think and act \ngiven your goals and the state of the world.13 Rationality is generally broken into two parts: instrumental and \nepistemic. Instrumental rationality means that you behave so you achieve your objectives subject to your \nphysical and mental constraints (\u201cwhat to do\u201d). Epistemic rationality measures the degree to which your beliefs \nmap accurately to the world (\u201cwhat is true\u201d).14  \nDaniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky developed lines of research in psychology, including prospect theory and \nheuristics and biases, that documented how people depart from normative standards. Prospect theory describes \nhow people behave when faced with uncertainty and shows that they suffer losses more than equivalent-sized \ngains. This observation defies the tenets of expected utility theory which serve as the foundation for instrumental \nrationality.15  \nResearch on heuristics and biases shows that people often rely on heuristics, or rules of thumb, that are fast \nand simple but that can lead to a biased assessment. For example, when considering the probabilities of a \nspecific outcome, we commonly appeal to the heuristics of what is available in our minds. Nearly one-third of \ndeaths in the United States are related to heart disease while this cause receives only 2-3 percent of media \ncoverage and Google searches. Death from terrorism is relatively rare, but terrorism has a nearly one-third share \nof media accounts and Google searches.16       \nExhibit 3 shows the elements of rational thinking and in particular notes the inhibitors to crystalized rationality. \nFor instance, some beliefs are testable, which means they are tied to the world and can be confirmed by \nobservation. Other beliefs are distal, which are not testable or supported by experts or scientific knowledge.17 \nDistal beliefs can be detrimental to rational thinking. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The first has to do with improving forecasting skills and is a \ndirect result of the research done by the team at the GJP. Second are proper techniques for investment analysis, \nincluding making sure that investors use shorthands properly. The final one relates to grasping which aspects \nof a decision-making process can be systematic versus which require judgment.   \nThere are multiple forms of training to improve forecasting skills and they are not equally effective.19 The didactic \napproach teaches participants about judgment errors. For example, an instructor might share the research on \nbiases associated with overconfidence, framing, anchoring, and availability. This method has the benefit of being \nrelatively inexpensive to implement and the drawback of being mostly ineffective.  \nThe next training tactic is to explain specific techniques to check for bias.20 The use of base rates is among the \nmost effective of these. In order to make a forecast, most of us gather relevant information, combine it with our \nown views and experiences, and project. Base rates consider the problem as an instance of a larger reference \nclass and therefore start with a relevant distribution of past outcomes. For instance, instead of forecasting a \ncompany\u2019s revenue growth by doing a bottom-up analysis, an approach using base rates would examine the \nhistorical distribution of growth rates for similar businesses.  \nBase rates are underutilized in general because most forecasters place substantial weight on their own analysis \nand experience and base rates are not readily available in many instances. Good statistical predictions combine \nevidence for the specific case and base rates in proper measure.21 The leaders of the GJP found that teaching \nparticipants about base rates improved the accuracy of their forecasts relative to those who did not receive the \ntraining.  \nA third training approach is to structure problems differently so as to provide insight into the solution. Here\u2019s an \nillustration: imagine a test for a certain type of cancer where the prevalence is 0.3 percent, 50 percent of those \nwho have the cancer test positive, and the false positive rate is 3 percent. If someone tests positive, what is the \nprobability that they have the cancer? See what you come up with.  \nDoctors who were asked this question answered between 1 and 99 percent, and roughly half said 50 percent, \nthe test\u2019s sensitivity, or 47 percent, the test\u2019s sensitivity minus the false positive rate. The need to combine \nprobabilities makes this question confusing, and even professionals who should know how to interpret the data \nstruggled. \nThe answer is around five percent. The way to structure the question to make it easier to grasp is to translate \nthe probabilities into natural numbers.22 For example, assume a population of 2,000 people. We know that 6 of \nthem (.003 x 2,000) will have the cancer. We know that half of them, 3, will test positive. The false positive rate \nsays that about 60 of the people without the cancer will test positive (.03 x 1,994). The probability that someone \nwho tests positive has the cancer is therefore 3 divided by 62.8, or 4.8 percent.  \nThe final training approach, which addresses the core theme of this report, is timely and accurate feedback \nabout probabilistic forecasts. Think of weather forecasters. They predict the weather with probabilities (\u201cthere\u2019s \na 30 percent chance it will rain tomorrow\u201d). The weather outcome is a form of feedback. There is evidence that \nfeedback provides lessons that help increase the accuracy of future forecasts.23  \nThere are two qualities in particular that are worth cultivating. The first is calibration, which measures how closely \npercentage forecasts match the outcomes. A weather forecaster is well calibrated if it rains 30 percent of the \ntime that rain was predicted with a 30 percent probability.   \n"

All rights reserved. \n6506921 Exp. 3/31/2025 \n7 \n \nThe second is called discrimination, or resolution, and considers how different a particular outcome may be from \nthe base rate. For instance, it rains about one in three days in London, England.24 You can predict a 33 percent \nchance of rain each day and appear well-calibrated at the end of the year. But those forecasts would not be \nhelpful in planning picnics or walks in the park. Discrimination means it rains when you say rain and it\u2019s dry when \nyou call for sunshine. \nWe will discuss specific methods to improve feedback for investment professionals in the last section of this \nreport. \nThe second aspect of training for fundamental investors focuses on the correct methods for investment analysis. \nThe process for seeking excess returns varies by investment organization, so it is important to match the tools \nwith the task. But aspects of this training are particularly relevant. One is that there are right and wrong ways to \ndo particular calculations. The other is to make sure that all investors on the team understand the economic \nimplications of the assumptions they make. \nFor example, measures, including return on invested capital (ROIC), free cash flow, and customer lifetime value, \nshould be defined properly and calculated consistently throughout an investment organization. Investors who \nfeel the need to depart from standard definitions can be encouraged to calculate the measure in the agreed-\nupon way and then introduce the alternative approach with a clear explanation of why it adds insight. There also \nought to be a consistent way to estimate the opportunity cost of capital. \nAnother essential element of this training is to make sure that investors who use shorthands, predominately \nmultiples to assess valuation, understand the economic implications of those shorthands. For instance, a price-\nearnings ratio of 30 or an enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) \nratio of 18 embed assumptions about incremental ROIC, growth, and the cost of capital. An investor seeking to \ndiscern value should make those metrics explicit so that they can be discussed and debated. Shorthands should \nhave grounding in proper drivers of economic value. \nEffective communication skills are also an important aspect of investment analysis and can be improved via \ntraining. Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist with an expertise in linguistics, states flatly that \u201cwriting is an \nunnatural act.\u201d25 He makes the case for prose written in classic style, which entails showing the reader something \nconcrete in the world in a way that is conversational. He notes that with this style \u201cthe writer has worked hard to \nfind something worth showing and the perfect vantage point from which to see it.\u201d26  \nProper data visualization, using graphics to display data, is also important. When done well, data visualization \nconveys useful information to the viewer.27 Charts and graphs that are used more to make a point than share \nrelevant material are common in the investment industry. Indeed, research shows that how data are presented \ncan lead to different judgments about the same data.28 \nThe final aspect of training has to do with process development. Investors who rely on fundamentals need to \nconsider carefully the potential sources of market inefficiency that lead to market mispricing. Ed Thorp, a trained \nmathematician and highly successful hedge fund manager, said, \u201cThere is a market inefficiency if there is a \nparticipant who can generate excess risk-adjusted returns that can be logically explained in a way that is difficult \nto rebut.\u201d29 \nThere has been a lot of interest in recent years in blending quantitative and qualitive approaches to create a \nprocess that is more robust than one based on either approach alone. The idea is that man plus machine beats \neither man or machine. The key is assessing which aspects of investment process can be addressed \n"

For instance, Lewis Goldberg, a psychologist, found \nthat models of decision makers outperformed the decision makers that were modeled. This reveals an essential \nobservation: decision makers often know what to do in principle but fail to execute in reality.30    \nPractice versus Play. Practice is common for participants in a particular domain who want to get better. Athletes \nare an obvious example. Even elite professionals allocate a substantial amount of time to honing their skills. The \nratio of practice to play varies by sport, but there are no cases where practice is completely absent. Practice \nentails applying an idea, belief, or method versus just understanding theories related to results in an activity.  \nOne of the reasons that investment management is difficult is that there is an enormous amount of information \nto absorb. As a result, it is easy to get drawn into a pattern of all playing and no practicing. But no playing and \nall practicing is also obviously bad. The goal is to strike an appropriate balance between doing the job and \npracticing so as to improve the investment process. \nStudies of practice reveal a number of relevant points. First, practice in most activities allows us to pass through \nstages until we reach the autonomous stage, a point where skill becomes habitual and fluid. Performance is \nacceptable and repeating the activity does not improve results. The classic example is driving. Most of us can \nget around reasonably safely but certainly lack the skills of expert drivers. We get good enough and stop. And \nthat is fine for many things we do.31  \nSecond, there\u2019s a useful distinction between regular, or even purposeful, practice and deliberate practice.32 \nDeliberate practice requires full attention, occurs at the edge of a person\u2019s ability, and requires timely and \naccurate feedback. A good teacher or a coach can structure the practice and make appropriate corrections to \nperformance. Deliberate practice is more applicable to domains that are well understood, such as music or \nathletics, than it is in activities that are less objectively measured.32  \nThird, it is interesting to consider what practice looks like in the investment industry. The answer to a large \ndegree depends on how an investment manager seeks to generate excess returns. What skills a quantitative \nmanager needs to succeed are very different than what a long-term oriented fundamental investor requires. \nQuantitative managers rely more on a statistical approach and fundamental investors appeal more to judgment, \nbut the common denominator is the ability to make good decisions in the face of uncertainty.  \nFourth is the issue of skill transfer. Effective practice isolates the skills that are necessary to produce results. \nResearchers like to distinguish between drills and scrimmages. Drills distort the game so as to work on a specific \nskill under maximum concentration. Scrimmages mimic the game to get a feel for the cadence and \ncircumstances.33  \nSkill transfer is the degree to which working on a skill in one setting translates into another.34 For example, \nemployees at Susquehanna International Group, a trading and technology firm, play poker, chess, and strategic \nboard games to hone their skills and \u201capply them to complex financial markets.\u201d35 The main question is how, \nand to what degree, the skills you practice help improve your investment process.  \nFinally, it helps to start by considering what we usually do in order to think about how we can do it better. \nInvestors, just as people in many walks of life, usually think by analogy.36 They compare two things with the \nsense that one idea will help explain or clarify the other.  \n \n"

We then compare the source to the target to make inferences, often in the form \nof similarities. These inferences are then modified to capture differences between the source and the target. We \nthen consider the lessons from the analogy\u2019s success or failure.37 \nWe typically tap our memory to come up with the source analogy. If we remember the right one, we learn about \na new situation quickly. But more often than not we run into two potential problems. The first is the lack of \nbreadth. We are simply unaware of other analogies that may be more appropriate than the one that is available \nto our minds. The second is a lack of depth. We make inappropriate inferences because the analogy relies too \nmuch on superficial similarities and fails to recognize causality.  \nThe use of base rates is the remedy for the problems of breadth and depth. Base rates are particularly useful in \ncertain cases where the reference class is well understood and has a distribution of outcomes that exhibit \u201cmild \nrandomness\u201d and hence can be readily modeled statistically. Base rates can be more challenging when there is \nno ready reference class or when the distribution of outcomes show \u201cwild randomness\u201d and hence are difficult \nto measure.38  \nIn domains such as sports and music, coaches or teachers oversee practice and provide valuable real-time \nfeedback to improve results. The distinction between critique and correction is useful. A critique points out that \nsomething was done wrong and explains how to do it better. A correction requires doing it over, and properly, at \nthe earliest possible opportunity.39 This means that errors in reasoning or technique should be identified and \ncorrected on the spot. \nAtul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts as well as a writer and \npublic health researcher, wondered about the widespread use of coaches in sports and the dearth of coaches \nin medicine. He asked a surgeon under whom he\u2019d trained to be his \u201ccoach\u201d for one of his operations. He \nsuggests \u201cthe case went beautifully,\u201d but his coach had lots of observations about what he could have done \nbetter. There is a lot of opportunity to improve coaching in the investment business. Gawande suggests, \n\u201cCoaching done well may be the most effective intervention designed for human performance.\u201d40 But it starts by \nprofessionals acknowledging that there is room to improve.  \nOrganizations \nIt is essential to find the right people and help them flourish, but it\u2019s also important to recognize that most people \nmake decisions from within an organization. Research shows that individual beliefs and productivity are shaped \nin part by organizations.41 For example, star investment professionals who switch firms tend to see a \ndeterioration of their performance. The main reason is that the star\u2019s skills were a better fit for the prior firm than \nthe new one.42   \nCulture can play a significant role in mediating beliefs and behaviors. Researchers often describe culture as \nreflecting values and norms. Values are the standards of behavior that employees seek to realize, and norms \nare the degree to which they behave according to those values.43 Values and norms are influenced by governing \nobjectives, incentives, teamwork, and the overall organizational environment. We want to examine these in the \ncontext of feedback.   \n \n"

An organization\u2019s governing objective is a clear statement of what it is fundamentally \ntrying to accomplish. It molds an organization\u2019s culture, communications, and choices about how it allocates \nresources. A clear governing objective gives decision makers a basis for dealing with the trade-offs that naturally \narise in a dynamic setting. It also provides insiders and outsiders with a benchmark for assessing results.44  \nThe most vivid example of dueling governing objectives for corporations is a focus on creating shareholder value \nversus building stakeholder value. We argue that creating long-term value considers the interests of all \nstakeholders while providing a basis for choosing between strategic and financial options. Stakeholder value \nseeks to maximize the interests of all stakeholders, which is impossible to do simultaneously.45 As a result, \nstakeholder value ends up being a matter of management discretion with no clear way to assess outcomes.  \nInvestment management organizations also have tension between two potential objectives.46 Charles Ellis, the \nfounder of Greenwich Associates and an investment industry luminary, distinguishes between the profession \nand business of investment management. The profession is focused on generating attractive long-term returns \nfor investors. The business is focused on producing sales and profits for the investment firm. Ellis correctly \nobserves that a healthy business is necessary to support the profession, if only to attract and retain talent, but \nthat the pendulum can swing away from the profession toward the business. He emphasizes that the optimal \nbalance must always favor the profession over the business because it is the best path to attract and develop \ntalented investors.  \nIncentives. Feedback that encourages individuals to stay true to the governing objective can come from sources \ninside or outside the organization. Incentives can also play a large role in encouraging actions consistent with \nthe organization\u2019s broader goal. Proper incentives make pursuing the governing objective \u201can act of enlightened \nself-interest\u201d for an organization\u2019s members.47 \nEffective incentives are very difficult to design, and incentives by themselves rarely promote the proper \nbehaviors. But every effort should be made to align incentives with the governing objective. Investors committed \nto the profession should have enough skin in the game to feel the organization\u2019s ups and downs, but not so \nmuch as to impair judgment. Research shows that funds with high portfolio manager ownership do better than \nthose with low ownership.48 That said, managers who own large stakes in the funds tend to take fewer risks, \nespecially after a spell of poor results or investor outflows.49  \nTeams. One of the most profound changes in the investment management industry has been the shift from \nsingle- to team-managed funds. About 65 percent of funds had a single manager 30 years ago and about 20 \npercent do today (see exhibit 5).50 Team-run funds have generated higher excess returns than have single-\nmanaged funds, and they have done so with a lower standard deviation.51 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Psychological safety exists \nwhen people feel comfortable saying what they think without concern that they will be punished if they make a \nmistake. Leaders can foster this openness by emphasizing collaboration over conflict and curiosity over blame.55 \nThe virtue of psychological safety is that all points of view get a voice. \nBut the evidence of the value of group discussion is mixed. It can be the case that someone\u2019s insight gets \ndrowned out by the opinion of another, which is especially likely when there are differences in seniority. Collective \ncalibration is a group quality that overcomes this. The idea is that individual members who are better calibrated, \nmeaning that their confidence matches their accuracy, make the group\u2019s discussion more fruitful.56 This \nunderscores that training in forecasting techniques can benefit individuals as well as teams. \nSuccessful teams have members who are capable. Feedback should focus on how the team is managed. \nEssential elements include the ideal team size and makeup, having a leader or moderator who makes sure that \nall information and alternative views are brought to the surface, and proper voting techniques.57  \nEnvironment. Researchers distinguish between algorithmic and heuristic tasks within an organization.58 \nAlgorithmic tasks deal with situations where cause and effect are clear and the goal can be achieved by following \na recipe. Heuristic tasks arise in evolving and novel environments where there are no set steps to success. For \ninstance, creating policy is essentially a prediction and policies often don\u2019t succeed.59 \nEssentially all companies include algorithmic and heuristic elements. But in general, algorithmic tasks are more \nassociated with businesses with tangible assets, and heuristic tasks accompany intangible assets. Visualize a \nsteel mill in 1900. You can imagine a lot of workers carrying out tasks such as moving ore, feeding furnaces, \nand shaping steel but only a few fashioning new instructions. Algorithmic and heuristic tasks were both important, \nbut most of the manpower was dedicated to implementing instructions. \nNow visualize a research and development (R&D) lab where scientists seek to create a vaccine to provide \nimmunity against a novel pathogen. Creating an efficacious vaccine is the hard part. The manufacturing must \nbe done to exacting standards but the process is relatively straightforward.60 Tasks within organizations are \nmigrating from algorithmic to heuristic, following the evolution from tangible to intangible assets.61  \nLeaders of organizations that partake primarily in heuristic work should strive to create an environment \nconducive to success. First, it should be committed to ongoing learning. In investment management, this means \nconstant reading, welcoming guests who have done useful or provocative work, and sharing ideas across the \norganization efficiently.  \nGood organizations also welcome different points of view. This starts in the hiring process with an emphasis on \ncognitive diversity. Cognitive diversity measures functional knowledge, personality, representations, mental \nmodels, and categorizations. Most research shows that cognitive diversity is one of the key ingredients in groups \nthat make good decisions.62 \nFrameworks for surfacing and selecting good ideas are also important. Ideally, these have been established and \nreinforced via training and practice. These mechanisms include the use of base rates and red teams, a method \nto create structured disagreement. Auditing the decision-making process is also a vital mechanism for feedback.   \nFinally, leaders should attempt to create an environment of equanimity. All organizations go through ups and \ndowns, so removing peaks and valleys is essential. A focus on proper process with a long-term view contributes \nto this attitude.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n6506921 Exp. 3/31/2025 \n13 \n \nFeedback During Process Execution  \nProviding feedback to fundamental investors is inherently difficult because the process to make decisions is \noften poorly defined and the outcome, the rise and fall of asset prices, is noisy in the short run. One way to solve \nthis problem is to break down decisions into measurable components. But it all starts with documenting decisions \nand how they are made. Without a record of what you expect to happen, it is difficult to measure the accuracy \nof your predictions. \nAn investor who buys or sells a security in the hope of generating an excess return must have a variant \nperception, a well-founded view that the market has not priced properly. The variant perception, in turn, can be \nbroken into subcomponents. Those subcomponents can be evaluated using a mechanism to score the accuracy \nof the predictions. This provides a solid foundation for intermediate feedback.    \nThe Brier score, developed by the meteorologist Glenn Brier in the 1950s, is a popular method for tracking the \naccuracy of probabilistic forecasts.63 One version adds the square of the forecast error for the event, (forecast \nof event \u2212 outcome)2, to the square of error for the non-event, (forecast of non-event \u2212 outcome)2. For binary \nevents, the value of the outcome is 1 if the event occurs and 0 if it does not. For instance, if you predict rain \ntomorrow with an 80 percent probability and it does rain, your Brier score is 0.08 [(0.80 \u2013 1)2 + (0.20 \u2013 0)2]. This \nversion has a scale from 0 to 2 and, as in golf, a lower score is better.   \nYou can calculate the Brier score for a prediction when you state a measurable outcome by a specified date \nwith an associated probability. The straightforward step is to translate the essential elements of the variant \nperception into forecasts that can receive a Brier score. This allows for timely feedback on the aspects of the \ninvestment case that matter. \nYou might imagine a case where the market has priced in 100 new value-creating subscribers for a business \nduring the next quarter and your variant perception is that the number of new subscribers will meaningfully \nexceed that level. Your prediction might be \u201cthe company will have more than 110 new subscribers by the end \nof the quarter with an 80 percent probability.\u201d You can calculate your Brier score once the company has disclosed \nthe subscriber number. \nThe best forecasters don\u2019t just set a probability and leave it at that. They constantly make small refinements to \ntheir probability estimates as new information arrives. Those who make poor forecasts tend to either stick to \ntheir initial forecast or make rare revisions.64  \nThe intelligence community has developed a technique called \u201clinchpin analysis\u2019\u2019 that can be helpful in isolating \nthe foundation for a variant perception. Roger George, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency and has \ntaught intelligence studies, summarizes the approach in the following steps:65 \n\u2022 Identify the main uncertain factors or key variables (drivers) that will determine an outcome. \n\u2022 Identify working assumptions (linchpin premises) about how the key drivers will operate. \n\u2022 Advance convincing evidence and reasoning to support the linchpin premises. \n\u2022 Address any indicators or signposts that would render linchpin premises unreliable. \n\u2022 Ask what dramatic events or triggers could reverse the expected outcomes. \n"

Should you develop an investment thesis and find that \nyou are missing widely on your forecasts about outcomes, the signposts present an opportunity to revisit your \nthesis and, if appropriate, to revise your view.  \nMost investment organizations have the raw material to keep Brier scores but fail to do so. Part of it is that \nkeeping track of decisions requires some discipline. But the bigger issue is that when we are wrong, we generally \ncope by crafting a story to explain what happened in a way that avoids making us look bad. We are poor at \npredicting but great at explaining the past.66 \nBut feedback can provide a payoff. First, just knowing that a component of an investment thesis will be evaluated \nencourages more thoughtful analysis and input. The relevance of base rates is immediately clear when \nindividuals are asked to attach probabilities to events.   \nThere is also evidence that this type of feedback improves calibration.67 Researchers in one study asked weather \nforecasters to make predictions on outcomes such as wind speed, visibility, and precipitation. They were \ngenerally overconfident, which means their subjective probabilities exceeded the observed outcomes (see light \nblue line in exhibit 7). The forecasters were then given extensive feedback and asked to repeat similar forecasts. \nThe results were substantially more accurate the second time (see dark blue line). \nExhibit 7: Feedback Improves Calibration \n \nSource: Allan H.

One is to periodically \naudit the process behind major decisions. Importantly, this should include decisions that turned out fine as well \nas those that turned out poorly. The goal is to honestly appraise the quality of the process, as good outcomes \ncan be the result of a bad process and good luck, and bad outcomes can be the result of a good process and \nbad luck. \nAnother procedure is to keep track of decisions that led to no action. For example, an organization may \ncontemplate the purchase of a specific security and pass on it. That decision should remain in the database and, \nlike the decision to act, be evaluated periodically. \nFinally, we can collect feedback from machines. Chess is an interesting example. Chess programs were deemed \nto have achieved superhuman levels of performance when Deep Blue beat world champion Garry Kasparov in \n1997. The Elo rating system is a standard way of measuring relative skill in zero-sum games. The best chess \nplayer in the world today, Magnus Carlsen, has an Elo rating of 2865. The best chess program, Stockfish 14, \nhas a rating of around 3540. (AlphaZero Chess, which beat Stockfish years ago, does not have an official rating \nbut it is assumed to be higher than that of Stockfish.) The rating difference suggests that Carlsen would have \nless than a two percent chance of beating Stockfish.  \nCarlsen and other elite players now use the chess programs as teachers. They can consider moves and then \nconsult the program to get feedback on their strength. This is a machine giving feedback in order to improve a \nhuman\u2019s game.68  \nYou might imagine a similar process in investment management. Position sizing within a portfolio, for example, \ncan be expressed mathematically when the goals, constraints, and inputs are well specified. In concept, portfolio \nmanagers could have run a portfolio management program to suggest optimal position sizes given the \nassumptions. The investor could then compare their own intuitions against the machine\u2019s calculations to see if \nand why there are differences.  \nConclusion  \nFeedback is information that is applied to improve results. In this report, we focused on how feedback can \nimprove the long-term outcomes for investment organizations. \nWe started by discussing the qualities of good thinking, including the characteristics of superforecasters, a group \nthat made accurate forecasts above what chance would dictate, and the rationality quotient, a measure of \nrational decision making. The important insight is that intelligence quotient and rationality quotient measure \ndifferent things and have only partial overlap. Superforecasters would likely score high on the test of rationality. \nIn particular, a significant attribute is being actively open-minded. \nGetting the right people is great, and their skills can be enhanced through proper training. Learning how to apply \nbase rates properly is a particularly effective tool for decision makers facing probabilistic outcomes. Beyond \ntraining, it is crucial to consider an appropriate ratio between practice and play. Investing is difficult in that there \nis always some information out there that we don\u2019t know. As a result, the temptation is to play constantly. But \nevidence in other fields suggests that allocating some time to practice, assuming the possibility of skill transfer, \nmay lead to improved outcomes. \n \n"
