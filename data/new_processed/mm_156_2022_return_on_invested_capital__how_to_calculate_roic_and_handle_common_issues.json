Discounting future cash flows \nmakes sure the investment is attractive relative to the capital\u2019s \nopportunity cost, the return on the next best alternative.  \nHere is one way to think about it. A company invests $10,000 and \nthe opportunity cost is 8 percent. In the first scenario, the \ninvestment generates cash flow of $500 per year into perpetuity, \nwhich equals a value of $6,250 ($500/.08). This fails the one dollar \ntest and illustrates why positive earnings do not always equate to \nvalue creation. \nIn the second scenario the business earns $800 in cash flow per \nyear, making the investment worth exactly the cost of $10,000 \n($800/.08). This business is value neutral. Note that growth adds \nno value in this case. Growth is like the speed setting on a treadmill. \nYou can turn it up or down but you are going nowhere. \nIn the final scenario, the firm produces cash flow of $1,100. This \npasses the one dollar test with flying colors, as the $10,000 is worth \n$13,750 ($1,100/.08). Growth is good. The faster the company can \ngrow while sustaining these returns, the more value it creates.  \nCompanies constantly make investments in capital expenditures, \nresearch and development (R&D), advertising, working capital, and \nmergers and acquisitions (M&A). Assessing the long-term payoff \nfrom investments can be tricky, even for relatively large and \ndiscrete deals such as M&A.1 \nThis report is about return on invested capital (ROIC), a financial \nmetric that can help with assessing whether a company is creating \nvalue with its investments. We will discuss how to calculate ROIC, \nshow how it is connected to free cash flow, economic profit, and \ngrowth, work through some of the practical challenges in estimating \nit properly, show empirical data, and review how the introduction of \nintangible investments can reshape the figures. All of these ideas \nwill be illuminated through a case study. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J. Mauboussin \nmichael.mauboussin@morganstanley.com \n \nDan Callahan, CFA \ndan.callahan1@morganstanley.com \n"

Finally, we will illuminate ROIC\u2019s shortcomings. We will see that the answer that ROIC \nprovides depends a lot on the question that is asked. \nOne way to consider whether the stock market recognizes ROIC is to examine the relationship between ROIC \nminus the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the ratio between the enterprise value and invested \ncapital for a universe of public companies. Enterprise value is the sum of the market value of net debt and equity. \nIf a company has invested successfully, as reflected in a positive spread between ROIC and WACC, then we \nwould expect the market to accord an enterprise value that is at a premium to the amount of invested capital. \nAcademics have found this to be the case.2 Exhibit 1 shows that this correlation, while not perfect, is a useful \nway to demonstrate that the market cares about ROIC. \nExhibit 1: The One Dollar Test for the Top 500 Companies by Sales, 2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Top 500 by sales in the Russell 3000 excluding financials and real estate; Enterprise value as of 8/30/22; Winsorized \nat 2nd and 98th percentiles; Truncated axes for visualization. \nFinancial metrics are widely used in the managerial and investment communities. But not all measures are \ncreated equal. A good metric is one that is well defined in concept and corresponds with desired objectives. \nROIC is straightforward in principle but requires numerous judgments in implementation. Shoddy calculations \nare common. \nWe recommend that investment organizations use a shared definition to make sure that figures are comparable \nacross industries and companies. Investors who choose to deviate from that norm can do the additional \ncalculation and explain why the changes offer insight into the economics of the business. ROIC can be useful, \nbut only if applied intelligently, consistently, and carefully.   \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nEnterprise Value / Invested Capital\nROIC - WACC (Percent)\nr = 0.59\n"

All rights reserved. \n6024006 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n3\n \nHow to Calculate ROIC \nROIC is easy to define: \nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) =  Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) \nInvested capital (IC)\n \nNet operating profit after taxes. NOPAT, the numerator of the ROIC calculation, is the cash earnings a \ncompany would have if it had no debt or excess cash. That means that NOPAT, unlike earnings, is the same \nwhether a company is financed with all equity or if it has a lot of debt. Removing the issue of capital structure \nallows for effective comparison between businesses.  \nThe calculation of NOPAT starts with operating income, or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). You then \nadd amortization from acquired intangible assets (A) and the embedded interest component of operating lease \nexpense.3 Operating lease interest expense is added back because it is a financing cost rather than an operating \nexpense. Finally, you subtract cash taxes, which include the tax provision, deferred taxes, and the tax shield. \nNOPAT = EBITA \u2013 cash taxes \nIt may seem odd to add back amortization of acquired intangibles but not depreciation even though both are \nnon-cash charges. Here\u2019s the rationale. Depreciation is correctly considered an operating expense because it \nreflects wear and tear on physical assets. For instance, a company that buys a machine with a useful life of five \nyears will record it in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) on its balance sheet and depreciate the asset on \nthe income statement over its life. \nAmortization of acquired intangibles reflects different accounting. Assume a company acquires a customer list. \nThe company would post the list as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortize it over its estimated \nuseful life. But the money it spends to maintain and grow the list is expensed on the income statement.  \nTangible and acquired intangible assets both lose value, but because the company expenses its investment to \nreplenish the intangible assets, we don\u2019t want to penalize the company twice, first through amortization and \nsecond through investment in intangibles. The appearance of the customer list on the balance sheet is a one-\ntime event as a result of the acquisition, and spending for future maintenance and growth reverts to the income \nstatement. \nAdding back the embedded interest from the operating lease expense is a relatively new adjustment. Starting in \nearly 2019, most companies reporting under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) must reflect leases on the balance sheet. Under GAAP, the \nentire lease expense, including embedded interest, is still expensed. Under IFRS, the lease payments are \nappropriately allocated between depreciation and interest expense. \nFor companies reporting using GAAP, you need to separate lease payments into these two parts and reflect \ndepreciation as an expense and treat the embedded interest expense as a financing cost. That means the \nembedded interest expense is added back to EBIT to calculate NOPAT.4 \nThe cash tax calculation has three parts. The first is the tax provision. Start with what you see on the income \nstatement, but make sure you adjust the figure for unusual items such as restructuring charges. If you are \nestimating taxes for a company that spends a lot on R&D, note that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) \nrequires R&D spent in the U.S. to be amortized over five years instead of being expensed immediately. This \nwent into effect in 2022. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6024006 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n4\n \nFor example, Northrop Grumman, an American aerospace and defense technology company, estimated its cash \ntaxes would increase $1 billion in 2022 as a result of the change.5 The tax provision lowers net operating profit. \nThe second is deferred taxes. This has a few components. Companies maintain two sets of books, one for \nfinancial reporting and the other for tax purposes. Companies typically use straight-line depreciation for reporting \nand accelerated depreciation for taxes. This creates a timing difference, with a company\u2019s reported taxes being \nhigher than its cash taxes.5 \nThese taxes have to be paid eventually, which is why they are recorded as a deferred tax liability. But this liability \ncan remain for years for a growing company that invests consistently in tangible assets. To reflect this item in \ncash taxes, you calculate the change from one year to the next in the deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. \nThe increase in the deferred tax liability reduces cash taxes.  \nCompanies also have deferred tax assets, which are predominantly taxes the company has already paid and \nhence won\u2019t have to pay in the future. This can be material because the Internal Revenue Service does not \nrecognize stock-based compensation as a deduction until the time of vesting. Companies report the difference \nbetween reported taxes and cash taxes as a tax asset.6   \nOne way to estimate deferred taxes is to calculate the year-to-year change in operating deferred tax liabilities \nminus deferred tax assets.7 \nThe final component of cash taxes is the tax shield that arises from the deduction associated with interest \nexpense. The tax shield reflects the difference between the taxes the company actually paid and the higher \ntaxes it would have paid had it been financed solely with equity. In other words, interest expense shields the \ncompany from having to pay some taxes. While this benefit is removed in the calculation of NOPAT, it is \nreintroduced in the estimation of the cost of capital. \nThe tax shield, net interest expense times the marginal tax rate, increases cash taxes for levered companies \nand puts all companies on an equal footing. But the TCJA also set a limit on the tax deductibility of interest at \n30 percent of EBIT that went into effect in 2022. We estimate that this affects 25 percent of the companies in \nthe Russell 3000 that had positive EBIT in the latest fiscal year. This analysis excludes companies in the financial \nand real estate sectors. About two-thirds of the companies under consideration had positive EBIT. \nIn a recent survey of chief financial officers of large corporations, only 24 percent cited interest deductibility as \nan important factor is determining debt levels, down from 60 percent in a similar survey in 2001. This is consistent \nwith a lower federal tax rate (35 percent in 2001 to 21 percent today), lower interest rates (the 10-year Treasury \nnote yield has dropped from about 5 percent to approximately 3.7 percent), and the limit in deductions.8 \nWe review the details of the NOPAT calculation to establish a firm foundation of understanding. Determining \ncash taxes, in particular, can be complicated. But it is usually sufficient to estimate NOPAT as EBITA \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \ncash tax rate). The cash tax rate is commonly a little below the stated tax rate for a growing business. Aswath \nDamodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School at New York University and a renowned expert in \nvaluation, estimates that cash taxes for a large population of companies were about 95 percent of reported taxes \nin 2021.9 \nExhibit 2 shows the calculation of net operating profit after taxes for Microsoft, a multinational technology \ncompany. For the company\u2019s fiscal 2022, EBITA is $87 billion and cash taxes are $17 billion, leaving it with \nNOPAT of $70 billion. \n"

You can think of invested capital, the denominator of the ROIC calculation, in two ways that \nare equivalent. The first is the net assets a company needs to generate NOPAT. The second is how the company \nfinances those net assets, typically through a combination of debt and equity. Double-entry bookkeeping makes \nsure that assets equal liabilities plus equity on a balance sheet. In other words, you can compute invested capital \nusing either the left- or right-hand side of the balance sheet. Exhibit 3 shows the components of invested capital. \nExhibit 3: How to Calculate Invested Capital \nOperating Approach \n \nFinancing Approach \nCurrent assets \n \nShort-term debt \n- Non-interest-bearing current liabilities \n \n+ Long-term debt \nNet working capital \n \n= Total debt \n \n \n \n \n \n+ Deferred taxes \n \n \n+ Other liabilities \n+ Net property, plant, & equipment \n \n \n+ Acquired intangibles \n \n \n+ Goodwill \n \n+ Preferred stock \n+ Other \n \n+ Common equity \n= Invested capital \n \n= Invested capital \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nInvested capital can be calculated from either side but we would select the operating approach if we had to pick \none. The operating side gives us a clear sense of the assets the company is deploying and allows us to track \nchanges in asset efficiency over time. The financing approach tells us how the company finances its operations. \nIt is common for managers and investors to calculate invested capital using debt and equity, which can be very \nmisleading for reasons that we will see.  \nLet\u2019s review the calculation starting with the operating approach. We begin with net working capital, a measure \nof liquidity that is defined as current assets minus non-interest-bearing current liabilities (NIBCLs). The term \n\u201ccurrent\u201d means the company expects the item will be an inflow or outflow of cash within the next year. Accounts \nreceivables and inventories are generally the largest components of current assets. You should subtract excess \ncash and marketable securities in your calculation of current assets.   \n"

Accounts payable and other current liabilities are the \nlargest parts of NIBCLs. \nThere are a few points worth noting on net working capital. First, we want to include only the cash the company \nneeds to run its operations. Excess cash and marketable securities should therefore be excluded. We discuss \nexcess cash in more detail below. \nSecond, net working capital can be negative when NIBCLs are greater than current assets. Companies in this \nsituation have a negative cash conversion cycle, which is a measure of how long it takes a company to collect \non the sale of inventory.10 In effect, these businesses can sell their inventory and collect cash before they have \nto pay their suppliers. As a result, suppliers effectively become a source of financing. There is academic research \nthat suggests the cash conversion cycle can be a useful aid in stock picking.11 \nA company can\u2019t sustain a negative cash conversion cycle forever, but it can maintain one for a very long time. \nNet working capital changes are generally tied to a company\u2019s growth rate. Be sure to check changes in net \nworking capital if you see an acceleration or deceleration in a company\u2019s growth. \nFinally, net working capital has declined for companies in the U.S. over the last fifty years, going from nearly 30 \npercent of assets in the 1970s to under 10 percent of assets today. Reduction in inventory is the largest single \ncontributor to this decline.12 This change is likely the result of more sophisticated methods for managing \ninventory and an evolution across the economy from a reliance on tangible to intangible assets. \nNext, we add net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), which reflects gross investment in PP&E less \naccumulated depreciation. PP&E is a tangible, non-current asset. Some companies also invest in internal-use \nsoftware. Even though this is an intangible investment, you should treat it the same as PP&E. This intangible \ninvestment is amortized over its useful life.13 \nLeases longer than one year also appear on the balance sheet. On the asset side, it shows up as a right-of-use \nasset, which is the lessee\u2019s right to use the asset over the duration of the lease. Accountants quantify it by \nestimating the present value of lease payments.  \nNext, we add intangible assets that are recorded on the balance sheet following an acquisition. Accountants \nrecognize an item as an intangible asset if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or can be separated or \ndivided from the company.14 Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. \nGoodwill captures the acquired assets that don\u2019t meet those criteria. Goodwill is basically the purchase price of \nan acquisition minus the fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities. In other \nwords, goodwill represents future economic benefits from acquired assets that are not individually identified and \nseparately recognized.  \nGoodwill is not amortized, but companies must periodically test goodwill for impairment. A company takes an \nimpairment charge when it deems the fair market value of goodwill to be below its carrying cost. \nFinally, we include any other long-term operating assets. The key in estimating invested capital is to reflect all \nof the assets the company needs to run its business. There are a number of nonoperating assets that should \nnot be part of invested capital but do need to be reflected in valuation. These include excess cash and \nmarketable securities, equity investments in other companies, non-consolidated subsidiaries, finance \nsubsidiaries, overfunded pension funds, and tax loss carryforwards.15  \n"

We start with debt, which includes all short- and long-\nterm interest-bearing liabilities. This captures every form of debt from commercial paper to bonds with a 100-\nyear maturity.16 Operating lease obligations must also be reflected as a source of financing. \nTo this we add equity, which includes preferred stock, other equity-linked securities, and shareholders\u2019 equity. \nFinally, we need to account for other long-term liabilities, which are sometimes referred to as \u201cequity \nequivalents.\u201d These include deferred taxes, underfunded pension funds, and unearned revenue. \nExhibit 4 shows the calculation of invested capital for Microsoft, which was $165 billion in fiscal 2022. A number \nof items are worthy of comment. First, we assume the company needs cash equivalent to two percent of revenue. \nNext, notice that net working capital is negative. Goodwill and other intangibles represent nearly one-half of \ninvested capital, which indicates the company has made acquisitions. Finally, other long-term liabilities are about \none-third of invested capital from the financing side. Long-term income tax is the largest component within that \nline item. The company is potentially on the hook for a large tax bill. \nExhibit 4: Microsoft\u2019s Invested Capital, 2020-2022  \nOperating approach (traditional) \n \n \n \n \nFinancing approach \n \n \n \n($ Billions) \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n \n($ Billions) \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \nCash * \n3  \n3  \n4  \n \nCurrent portion long-term debt \n4  \n8  \n3  \nAccounts receivable, net  \n32  \n38  \n44  \n \nLong-term debt \n60  \n50  \n47  \nDeferred income taxes \n0  \n0  \n0  \n \n \n \n \n \nInventories \n2  \n3  \n4  \n \n \n \n \n \nOther current assets \n11  \n13  \n17  \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal current assets \n48  \n57  \n69  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n- NIBCLs \n69  \n81  \n92  \n \nOther long-term liabilities \n51  \n53  \n56  \nNet working capital \n(20) \n(23) \n(23) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProperty and equipment, net \n44  \n60  \n74  \n \n \n \n \n \nOperating lease right-of-use assets \n9  \n11  \n13  \n \n \n \n \n \nGoodwill \n43  \n50  \n68  \n \n \n \n \n \nIntangible assets, net \n7  \n8  \n11  \n \n \n \n \n \nOther long-term assets \n13  \n15  \n22  \n \nShareholders' equity \n(18) \n9  \n59  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInvested capital \n96  \n120  \n165  \n \nInvested capital \n96  \n120  \n165  \nSource: Microsoft Corporation and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Cash = 2 percent of revenue. \nThis is the standard way to calculate invested capital. However, it does a poor job of capturing intangible \ninvestments. We dedicate a section to that topic below. The idea is that we must recast our calculations of \nNOPAT and invested capital if some percentage of Microsoft\u2019s selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs \nare reasonably classified as an investment. As we will see, NOPAT and invested capital both go up and ROIC \ngoes down. \nLet\u2019s now return to ROIC. For fiscal 2022, Microsoft\u2019s NOPAT was $70 billion, its average invested capital was \n$143 billion (the average of $120 billion in fiscal 2021 and $165 billion in fiscal 2022), and its ROIC was 49 \npercent.  \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6024006 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n8\n \nHow ROIC Is Linked to Free Cash Flow, Economic Profit, and Growth \nFirm value is determined by projecting future free cash flow (FCF) and discounting it to the present. FCF equals \nNOPAT minus the investment in future growth. \nWe have already defined NOPAT. Investment in future growth captures changes in net working capital, capital \nexpenditures net of depreciation, and other investments such as acquisitions. Investment in future growth is \ntherefore equivalent to the change in invested capital.  \nThis creates a convenient opportunity to build a check in a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Since you have \nan estimate of the initial invested capital and the model is projecting future NOPAT and investment, you can \ncalculate the ROIC in any future year by taking the NOPAT and dividing it by the corresponding invested capital \nthat your forecast creates.  \nFor example, take a company that in the base year has NOPAT of $100 and invested capital of $500, for an \nROIC of 20 percent. You model 10 percent NOPAT growth, which puts NOPAT in year 2 at $121 ($100 x [1.10]2), \nand you assume the investment in each of the next couple of years is $25. Your ROIC in year 2 would then be \n$121/$550, or 22 percent. The question is whether the trend in ROIC implied by your model is consistent with \nthe economic and competitive environment that you anticipate. \nHistorical results show that ROIC tends to regress toward the mean. Regression toward the mean says that \noutcomes that are far from average are followed by outcomes with expected values closer to the average. Exhibit \n5 breaks the population of companies into quintiles based on their ROICs in 2016 and follows each cohort for \nfive years. It shows that the ROICs for the high-return businesses go down on average and the ROICs for the \nlow-return businesses go up on average.   \nThis simple picture belies a lot of richness in the data. Some businesses start with high ROICs and get even \nbetter. Others have low ROICs that don\u2019t improve. But regression is powerful. You want to make sure that your \nmodel reflects your view and considers the base rate. \nExhibit 5: Regression Toward the Mean for Russell 3000, 2016-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Russell 3000 excluding financials and real estate. \n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nROIC Minus Median (Percent)\n"

But it is important to acknowledge that the most popular \ndescription of FCF that companies and investors use is cash flow from operating activities minus capital \nexpenditures, items found on a company\u2019s statement of cash flows.17 This deviates from the textbook definition \nin a few meaningful ways. To begin, stock-based compensation is added back to calculate cash flow from \noperating activities. This means that a potentially significant expense is ignored. Stock-based compensation, \nreally a form of financing, can be a considerable contributor to cash flow from operating activities, in some cases \nexceeding 100 percent.   \nCash flow from operating activities also starts with net income, so it is after financing costs. This is not a problem \nif your model calculates free cash flow to equity (FCFE). But one survey shows that in practice investors use the \nfree cash flow to the firm (FCFF) model nearly twice as often as the FCFE model.18 \nFinally, the common definition of FCF excludes investments made through lease commitments. These should \nbe considered equivalent to capital expenditures but are recorded in cash flow from financing activities.19   \nROIC is linked to valuation through economic profit, a measure of residual income. It is called \u201cresidual\u201d because \nit is income after all costs have been taken into consideration, including the cost of capital. The concept has \nbeen around for more than a half century.20   \nYou can calculate economic profit in two ways that provide identical answers: \nEconomic profit  = (ROIC \u2013 WACC) x Invested capital \n \n \n= NOPAT \u2013 (Invested capital x WACC)    \nStern Stewart & Company, a consulting firm, popularized the idea in the 1990s through Economic Value Added \n(EVA\u2122).21 The main contribution of EVA was the introduction of a slew of adjustments to invested capital. We \ndiscuss some of these adjustments below. \nThe important point is a discounted cash flow model driven by free cash flow or economic profit give the exact \nsame answer if the terms are defined correctly and the inputs are the same. See Appendix A for a discussion.      \nROIC also has a link to growth. Specifically, the level of ROIC is the maximum supportable growth rate of the \nbusiness excluding external financing. This is based on the following formula: \nGrowth = ROIC x (1 \u2013 payout ratio) \nThe payout ratio is the proportion of NOPAT a company pays out to its shareholders in the form of dividends \nand buybacks. Money paid out to shareholders leaves less to invest in the business.  \nLet\u2019s go back to our company with NOPAT of $100 and invested capital of $500. We\u2019ll assume no payout. \nBecause the ROIC is 20 percent and the payout is zero, the formula tells us the business has the potential to \ngrow 20 percent. In this case, the company would reinvest the whole $100, building invested capital to $600. \nBecause ROIC remains stable, the NOPAT would grow 20 percent to $120 (.20 x $600). In the following year, \ninvested capital would increase to $720 and NOPAT to $144. And so forth. \nAnother insight from the formula is that companies that have growth rates that are lower than their ROIC will be \nable to pay out cash to their shareholders without jeopardizing growth. For example, if our company could grow \nonly 10 percent, it would be able to invest $50 and pay out $50.  \nCompanies can grow faster than their ROIC of course. But to do so they must have access to additional capital, \ntypically in the form of debt or equity. For example, Walmart\u2019s growth rate was roughly double its ROIC for the \n"

But this growth \ncreated substantial shareholder value because the company\u2019s ROIC was well in excess of the cost of capital.  \nThe research shows that those companies that sustained high ROICs and high sales growth generated much \nhigher total shareholder returns than companies with low returns and growth.22  \nBut it is also crucial to bear in mind that incremental investment opportunities often become less attractive over \ntime. We saw this in the chart on regression toward the mean. Companies that can sustain high growth and high \nROICs are rare. One study found retailers that cut back their expansion in new stores, avoiding investment that \nprovided earnings growth but no economic value, generated higher returns than those that chased growth. 23 \nPractical Challenges in Calculating ROIC \nEstimating ROIC is conceptually straightforward but there are a number of practical matters to consider when \ndoing the calculation. These lead to potential adjustments that require good judgment and reasoning. Without \nthese changes, ROIC loses some of its absolute and relative usefulness. \nThe four topics we cover include dealing with: 1. excess cash and marketable securities; 2. restructuring, write-\noffs, and litigation charges; 3. minority interests; and 4. share buybacks.  \nExcess cash and marketable securities. In order to assess how much cash is necessary we need to start with \nthe reasons that companies hold cash.24 The first is based on operations. All businesses need some liquidity in \nthe form of cash on hand to go about their business. This figure is generally a relatively small amount. \nAnother reason is that young businesses, and especially those with substantial intangible assets, hold high cash \nbalances as a precaution.25 Since these companies know they will need to access capital and recognize that \ncapital markets can be fickle, building a cash balance buffers a business from external vagaries and allows \nmanagement to dwell on building the business. Consistent with this thinking, cash balances as a percentage of \nassets tend to decline as companies get bigger. \nSome companies think of their excess cash as having option value. An option is the right but not the obligation \nto make an investment. Companies with surplus cash are in a position to pounce when attractive internal or \nexternal investment opportunities arise. This is a reasonable way to think about the cash balances at Berkshire \nHathaway, a conglomerate holding company. Warren Buffett, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive \nofficer, has a long and excellent record of capital allocation. The market values the cash of firms with good \ninvestment opportunities at a premium to the value on the books.26 But this cuts both ways. Cash held by firms \nwith poor corporate governance is valued at a discount.27 \nFinally, some companies hold more cash than they need when executives have little incentive to disburse or \ndeploy it. Cash holdings can buffer a company\u2019s risk. For example, cash balances tend to be higher in countries \nwhere shareholder rights are weaker.28 \nThere are two schools of thought with regard to excess cash and marketable securities. The first argues that \nexecutives serve as the stewards of capital and hence should have their feet held to the fire to deliver returns \nabove the cost of capital on all of the company\u2019s capital. This approach gives no pass to those companies with \npoor governance or poor incentives. This boils down to an issue of capital allocation. Executives should make \nsure that all assets are delivering value if their prime responsibility is the judicious allocation of capital.  \nThe second school believes that investors should address the ROIC calculation and capital allocation issues \ndistinctly. The ROIC calculation is meant to provide insight into how efficiently a company uses its operating \n"

An assessment of management\u2019s capital allocation skills focuses on how the company allocates its \nresources and what the prospective returns from those actions may look like. \nWe are in the second camp. The high levels of cash today, especially in certain sectors, underscores the \nimportance of focusing on capital allocation. But if you are trying to understand the underlying economics of the \nbusiness you are better off removing excess cash. You then can debate the issues surrounding capital allocation. \nSo how do you strip out excess cash? Once a company reaches a steady state, a rule of thumb suggests you \nshould include about two percent of revenue as necessary cash. For less predictable companies with greater \ngrowth prospects, a ratio of cash to revenue up to five percent may be appropriate.  \nTake Microsoft as an example. We assumed the company needs cash equivalent to two percent of revenue, or \n$4 billion, for fiscal 2022. The company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $105 billion. \nIncluding this full amount would take invested capital from $165 billion to $266 billion and ROIC from 49 percent \nto 29 percent. \nThe issue of surplus cash also shows why it can be dangerous to calculate invested capital with the financing \napproach only. If you agree that stripping out excess cash is appropriate, you remove it from current assets on \nthe operating side and simultaneously deduct it from shareholders\u2019 equity on the financing side. A simplistic \nfocus on the financing side leaves you in no position to know whether there is too much cash, much less what \nthe proper adjustment should be.   \nOne final point, which may at first appear counter to the other points in this discussion. A DCF using FCF derives \na firm, or corporate, value. To come up with a value per share, you add nonoperating assets, subtract liabilities, \nand divide by the shares outstanding. The common prescription is to designate some cash and marketable \nsecurities as necessary to run the business and consider only the excess amount to be a nonoperating asset.29 \nThis is wrong. In fact, all cash and marketable securities should be added to firm value, provided that the \nestimates for working capital growth include the cash necessary to run the business.30  \nRestructuring, write-offs, and litigation. ROIC seeks to quantify the results of ongoing business operations. \nBut companies also report non-operating items that affect the income statement and balance sheet. Indeed, the \naverage number of non-core items that companies report per year is about one-third higher now than it was 25 \nyears ago.31 \nNon-operating items should be infrequent, unusual, and not anticipated to recur. But distinguishing between \noperating and non-operating items requires judgment in many cases.32 For example, what about a company that \ntakes modest restructuring charges in most years? Should you consider that to be an operating, or non-\noperating, item?  \nHere we discuss three of the most prominent non-core items\u2014restructuring charges, asset write-offs, and \nlitigation provisions\u2014and discuss their impact on the calculation of ROIC.   \n\u2022 Restructuring. Companies take a restructuring charge when they plan to change the organization of their \nbusiness. This is often, but not always, based on a plan to reduce costs. Cost cutting includes a reduction \nin the workforce and closure of facilities. These charges commonly require a cost upfront, for example \nemployee severance payments, and a benefit in the future.  \nKimberly-Clark, a multinational personal care company, recently completed a large restructuring program. \nThe company incurred cumulative costs of $2.2 billion pre-tax ($1.6 billion after-tax) to reduce its workforce \n"

These included costs for workforce reduction, asset write-\noffs, and additional capital expenditures. The result was $560 million of pre-tax cost savings.33 \nThe workforce reduction costs showed up both on the income statement, reducing NOPAT, and as a \nliability, affecting invested capital. The asset write-off reduced invested capital and the additional capital \nexpenditures had the opposite effect.   \nIn this case, we would advocate for stripping out the accounting adjustments for the restructuring with the \nexception of the additional capital spending. Further, it is appropriate to reflect the cost savings, to the \ndegree they are credible, in future NOPAT calculations. \nResearch shows that investors react favorably to restructuring charges that reduce costs and show little \nreaction to asset write-offs.34 A cost-benefit analysis of Kimberly-Clark\u2019s restructuring program illuminates \nwhy this might be the case. The cash costs of $1.6 billion offset a benefit of about $7.0 billion for a net \ngain of more than $5 billion.35   \n\u2022 Write-offs. A write-off or a write-down is an accounting charge to recognize that the value of an asset is \nimpaired. A write-off means the asset is valued at zero while a write-down reduces the carrying cost. While \nthese terms are used interchangeably, most charges are write-downs. \nAn asset write-off occurs when a company recognizes that it overstated an asset\u2019s useful life. Companies \noverstate asset lives because they fail to consider technological obsolescence and inflation. Obsolescence \noccurs when a new and improved asset comes along and renders the old one useless. Inflation is relevant \nbecause rising prices mean that capital expenditures will exceed depreciation, even when the business is \nstable, because new capital expenditures reflect inflation while depreciation is based on historical costs. \nDepreciation is often used as a proxy for maintenance capital spending, or the amount of spending a \nbusiness requires to sustain current operations. But it is common for companies to understate \nmaintenance capital expenditures. Indeed, the gap between maintenance capital expenditures and \ndepreciation is a predictor of future asset write-offs.36  \nHere again, the treatment of asset write-offs requires judgment. For companies that write off assets \nserially, adding back the charge to invested capital appears appropriate. Otherwise, the company\u2019s poor \ncapital allocation will not show up properly in the ROIC figures. If the occurrence is rare and the size of \nthe write-off is not material, it is reasonable to simply let it go without an adjustment. \nWe discussed goodwill, the difference between the purchase price for an acquisition and the value \nrecorded for tangible and intangible assets. Accountants test the value of goodwill periodically. The \ncompany takes an impairment charge if the accountants deem the value to be below the carrying cost. \nWell-known companies, including AOL Time Warner (now WarnerMedia), Kraft Heinz, and General \nElectric have each taken impairment charges in the tens of billions of dollars. These are admissions of \noverpaying for acquisitions. \nIt is standard to add back goodwill and intangible impairment charges. The thinking is that management \nshould be held accountable for past capital allocation decisions and that the value of goodwill does not \nwear out in theory.  \nMicrosoft\u2019s accumulated goodwill impairment as of year-end fiscal 2022 was $11.3 billion, the result of a \n$6.2 billion write-down in fiscal 2012 for aQuantive, a digital marketing service company acquired in 2007, \n"

Litigation has been on the rise for years, and high-profile cases such as BP plc, Enron, and \nVolkswagen show that lawsuits can be costly.37 The stocks of companies that are sued by shareholders \nreact negatively.38  \nThe impact on shareholder value can be meaningful but the impact on ROIC is more subtle. The first is \nthe potential liability to reflect the risk of losing a case and facing monetary penalties. Companies add the \nestimated liability to the balance sheet, which serves to reduce shareholders\u2019 equity. While invested capital \ndoes not change, the additional liabilities reduce shareholder value.  \nFor instance, BP plc ended up paying $20 billion to settle lawsuits associated with the Deepwater Horizon \noil spill in 2010, in addition to the costs associated with fines and cleanup costs. Note that defendants \nrarely pay the headline amount that plaintiffs demand because they generally have insurance that partially \noffsets the cost.  \nNOPAT can come under pressure as the result of potential reputational damage. After it falsely disclosed \nemissions for certain vehicles, Volkswagen was banned from selling diesel vehicles for some time. This \nwould lower ROIC in the future, all else being equal. \nCoping with these non-operating items requires discernment. When considering how to account for these items \nit is useful to bear in mind what we want to learn from a calculation of ROIC. We seek to understand the cash \nearnings the business earns given the capital it has invested. We want to make sure that the estimates of NOPAT \nand invested capital are consistent with one another and that management is held accountable for the capital \nallocation and accounting choices it makes. \nMinority interest. You need to make an adjustment for minority interest either when another company owns a \nmeaningful minority percentage of the company you are analyzing or the company you are analyzing owns a \nmeaningful minority stake in another company. \nIf a company owns part of the firm you are evaluating, you can proceed with the ROIC as normal. This takes \nlittle additional analysis since the minority interest is recorded below EBITA. The main item to heed is the tax \ncalculation. You do need to subtract the value of the minority stake to calculate shareholder value.  \nThe approach in the second case, where the company under study owns a meaningful minority stake in another \nbusiness, is similar to that of the first. Calculate ROIC as you normally would. Taxes can be tricky here, too. \nThen add the value of the minority stake, net of tax considerations, to corporate value to estimate shareholder \nvalue. \nShare buybacks. Many investors and executives are under the impression that because share buybacks can \nincrease earnings per share and return on equity (ROE), they must also benefit the level of ROIC. But if you \nremove excess cash, a step we think is sensible, buybacks have no impact on ROIC whatsoever. This is \nconsistent with the idea that ROIC is a calculation that is unaffected by how a business is financed. This is not \ntrue of ROE.  \nHere\u2019s the thinking behind the statement. The source of capital for buybacks comes either from surplus cash or \nadditional debt. If the company is using excess cash, it does not affect NOPAT or invested capital. NOPAT is \n"

And invested capital is the same because we remove excess \ncash on the operating side and deduct the same amount from shareholders\u2019 equity on the financing side.   \nSimilarly, funding a buyback with new debt leaves NOPAT and invested capital unchanged. NOPAT is \nimpervious to the additional interest expense, and the operating approach of invested capital remains identical. \nWith the financing approach, the increase in debt is offset dollar for dollar by a decrease in equity.  \nBuybacks can affect book value per share. Book value per share goes down if a company buys shares at a \npremium to book value. This is true even if the stock is undervalued. The stock\u2019s price-to-book ratio will go up, \nmaking it appear more expensive, but this is of no economic consequence. Further, the ratio of enterprise value \nto invested capital, a better indication of the one dollar test than the price-to-book ratio, does not change. \nEach of these practical issues demands some consideration but they can all be addressed in the service of \nunderstanding the economics of a business. There is one more adjustment, which deals with internally-\ngenerated intangible investments. Because accountants expense intangible investments on the income \nstatement rather than capitalize them on the balance sheet, NOPAT and invested capital are understated for \ncompanies that make substantial intangible investments.  \nWe will discuss this in detail. But before we do, we now share some empirical results on the pattern, trend, and \ndistribution of ROICs in the U.S. \nEmpirical Data \nExhibit 6 shows the distribution of ROICs for the Russell 3000 in 2021. This sample excludes companies in the \nfinancial and real estate sectors. The mode is an ROIC of 5 to 10 percent, and the distribution is shaped like a \nbell between the tails. But nearly 30 percent of the sample are at the extremes of an ROIC of -20 percent or less \nor 30 percent or more. Note that these figures consider goodwill and acquired intangibles as part of invested \ncapital, do not add back write-offs, and do not reflect the capitalization of internally-generated intangible assets. \nExhibit 6: Distribution of ROICs for the Russell 3000, 2021  \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate. \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n<(20)\n(20)-(15) (15)-(10) (10)-(5)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n25-30\n>30\nFrequency\nROIC (Percent)\n"

Companies can \nbe unprofitable because their costs are greater than their sales. Companies can also lose money as the result \nof substantial intangible investments that will pay off handsomely. These companies may have poor ROICs \nbefore adjusting for intangible investments but look substantially better after properly reckoning for them.40 \nDealing With Intangible Investments  \nOur empirical results show a gentle increase in the aggregate ROIC over time. But our calculation did not \nconsider the rise of intangible investments, perhaps the most important challenge in measuring ROIC accurately.  \nOver the last half century, the mix of investment has shifted from being predominantly tangible to mostly \nintangible. For example, a retail store is a tangible asset because it is physical and software is an intangible \nasset as it is non-physical. The nature of an investment is the same in both cases. It is an outlay of money today \nthat creates a stream of cash flows that is hopefully worth more than the cost.  \nThis shift is significant because the importance of tangible assets in explaining firm value has decreased in \nrecent decades and the significance of intangible assets has increased. Intangible assets now contribute roughly \ntwice as much to firm value as tangible assets do.41  \nHere\u2019s the analytical problem. Accountants record tangible investments on the balance sheet as assets and \ndepreciate them over their useful lives. The assets show up in our invested capital calculation and the \ndepreciation of those assets factors into NOPAT. This makes sense because depreciation spreads the cost of \nthe asset over its useful life. \nAccountants treat most intangible investments as expenses. Take R&D as an example. In late 1974, the \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board decided that companies should expense R&D because the benefits were \nuncertain and the link between R&D costs and sales was unclear.42 The logic applied to R&D was extended to \nadvertising, employee training, and the creation of software. \n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nSum of Annual Economic Profit, \nAverage 2017-2021 (Billions 2021 USD)\nDecile (Least to Most Economic Profit)\n"

We will call the line item \n\u201ccapitalized intangibles, net.\u201d This way we treat all investments alike.     \nTo do this effectively, we need to know which items within SG&A are appropriately considered investments and \nwhat their useful lives will be.43 Proper estimation of these items is a lively field of academic research.44 \nWe continue with our example of Microsoft to show how to capitalize intangible investments. Charles Hulten, a \nprofessor emeritus of economics at the University of Maryland and a top researcher in the field, estimated the \npercentage of Microsoft\u2019s various SG&A line items that can be considered an intangible investment.45 We use \nhis figures (see exhibit 11).46 \nExhibit 11: Intangibles on the Income Statement, Microsoft\u2019s Fiscal 2022 Figures \n \nPercent Allocated \n \nTo Intangible  \nIntangible \nItem                                             Amount \nInvestment  \nInvestment \nResearch and Development       $24.5 \n100 \n \n$24.5 \nSales and Marketing  \n  21.8 \n  70 \n \n  15.3 \nGeneral and Administrative \n    5.9 \n  20 \n \n    1.2 \nTotal                                            $52.2 billion \n \n \n$41.0 billion \nSource: Microsoft Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and Charles R. Hulten, \u201cDecoding Microsoft: Intangible Capital as a Source of \nCompany Growth,\u201d NBER Working Paper 15799, March 2010. \nBased on these assumptions, Microsoft spent $41 billion on intangible investment in fiscal 2022, more than \nthree-quarters of its total SG&A. That $41 billion is the sum that we will capitalize on the balance sheet. \nJust as we depreciate physical assets over their useful lives, we need to amortize these intangible assets over \ntheir useful lives. Hulten and Carol Corrado, perhaps the leading economist in this field, estimate the useful lives \nof various forms of intangible investment. Consistent with their findings, we amortize R&D over six years, and \nthe sales and marketing (S&M) and general and administrative (G&A) investments each over two years.47 \nWe now have the pieces we need to capitalize intangible investments. Before we get to the process, let\u2019s \nconsider what will happen to NOPAT and invested capital. \nOn the income statement, we are first going to remove the expense that is considered to be intangible \ninvestment. That will increase EBIT. But we also need to expense the amortization of past intangible investment. \nThat will lower the revised EBIT. When we net these adjustments, EBITA and NOPAT will be higher than the \ntraditional figures for a company that is growing.48   \nOn the balance sheet, we will reflect a new item, net intangible investment, which is the difference between \ncumulative gross intangible investment and accumulated amortization. This adjustment will increase assets for \nbusinesses that are expanding and therefore make invested capital higher than the traditional sum. \nBefore doing any calculations, we know NOPAT and invested capital will be higher than they were before the \nadjustment. ROIC is the ratio between the two, and we will see that capitalizing intangibles lowers ROIC for most \nprofitable companies. \n"

Next is the actual \ncalculation, which requires setting up schedules and, in many cases, estimating the initial stock of intangible \nassets.  \nOne outcome of this adjustment it that the ROICs for companies with very high or low results get pulled closer \nto the average. We have already seen this with Microsoft, where the adjusted return was much lower than the \ntraditional one. But this is generally true for companies with low, or negative, ROICs as well. In those cases, the \nadjusted return is higher than the traditional one. This adjustment makes the overall distribution tighter. See \nAppendix B for a demonstration.      \nThe exercise may not appear to be worth the effort, especially since it leaves the main driver of value, free cash \nflow, unchanged. But there are some significant payoffs from doing the work. First, the output provides insight \nabout the magnitude of profits and investments. This is particularly relevant for investors who rely predominantly \non multiples, such as price-to-earnings or enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and \namortization (EBITDA) as a proxy to value businesses.  \nThis is important because the larger the component of SG&A that is reasonably considered an investment, the \nlower the reported earnings will be. As a result, certain businesses that are investing aggressively and with \nattractive ROICs will appear to be statistically expensive.  \nFinally, adjusting ROICs brings the figures closer to earth. The distortion caused by the shift from tangible to \nintangible investment is to some degree mitigated and the ability to compare businesses in different industries \nimproves.  \nA company\u2019s absolute ROIC is a useful figure to know. But stock prices reflect expectations for the future, so \nwhat we want to understand is how ROIC might change relative to what\u2019s priced into the stock.

While ROIC provides a great deal of information about a business, what \nmatters is how ROIC will change in the future and whether that change will deviate from the market\u2019s \nexpectations.   \nWe need a measure of incremental change. One candidate is return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC), \nwhich has been adopted by some investors and companies.54 ROIIC captures the relationship between the \nchange in NOPAT and the change in invested capital. As such, it ignores sunk costs but in so doing assumes \nthat the return on the existing invested capital remains stable.55 \nHere is the calculation for ROIIC:    \nROIIC = \n Year1 NOPAT \u2013 Year0 NOPAT\nYear0 invested capital \u2013 Year-1 invested capital \nROIIC is the ratio of the change in NOPAT in one year to the investments the company made in the year before.  \nTo illustrate, assume a company\u2019s year-1 invested capital is $10,000 and it invests $1,000 during the year. Year0 \ninvested capital increases to $11,000. Further, NOPAT goes from $2,000 in year0 to $2,300 in year1. In this \ncase, ROIIC is 30 percent [($2,300 \u2013$2,000)/($11,000-10,000)]. \nAnnual ROIIC calculations can be very noisy, especially for businesses with NOPAT variability and lumpy \ninvestments. For example, Microsoft agreed to acquire Activision Blizzard, a video game company, in early 2022 \nfor $69 billion. Microsoft\u2019s invested capital will increase around 40 percent when that deal closes.   \nOne way to dampen the noise is to calculate ROIIC over three- or five-year periods. In the case of a three-year \nrolling ROIIC, you take the change in NOPAT over the last three years (Year3 NOPAT \u2013 Year0 NOPAT) and \ndivide it by the change in invested capital, again with a lag (Year2 invested capital \u2013 Year-1 invested capital).       \nExhibit 16 shows Microsoft\u2019s rolling three-year ROIIC from fiscal 2018 to 2022. The results in recent years have \nbeen high. But the figures were much lower following the $26 billion acquisition in 2016 of LinkedIn, an online \nservice focused on employment, and it will again drop after the Activision Blizzard deal closes.    \nExhibit 16: Microsoft\u2019s 3-Year Return on Incremental Invested Capital, 2018-2022 \n \nSource: Microsoft Corporation and Counterpoint Global. \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nPercent\n"

All rights reserved. \n6024006 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n23\n \nCompanies that earn high ROIICs are usually capital efficient or have substantial operating leverage. Operating \nleverage, which can push ROIIC in a positive or negative direction, measures the change in operating profit \ndivided by the change in sales and is important for companies with high fixed costs. Anticipating the change in \nearnings as the result of operating leverage is challenging and investors are not good at it.56 All of that noted, a \ncompany\u2019s historical ROIIC can help anticipate potential moves in earnings that are not priced in by the market. \nFor all of its utility, ROIIC is a substandard measure of economic value. It can shed light on the likelihood of \nchange and point out past patterns, but it should not be compared to the cost of capital or be considered a true \nmeasure of return. Specifically, ROIIC overstates economic returns when it is above the cost of capital and \nunderstates economic returns when it is below the cost of capital. This problem becomes more acute as the \nlength of the competitive advantage period extends.   \nWe have made the case that market-expected return on investment (MEROI) does a better job of reflecting \neconomic returns. MEROI is the return at which the present value of a company\u2019s profits equals the present \nvalue of the investments a company makes.57 \nAnalyzing Divisions \nROICs commonly vary a great deal for divisions or segments within a firm that has multiple businesses. Marakon \nAssociates, a consulting firm that is now part of CRA International, estimated that for many companies all of the \nvalue creation is concentrated in 50 percent of the invested capital.58 So getting a sense of ROIC by business \ncan tell you where value resides and where it might be getting wasted. Inertia appears to play a big role in capital \nallocation across divisions, and managers who allocate capital more proactively enjoy better financial results.59  \nPublic companies are required to disclose information about the segments within their businesses. This enables \nstakeholders, including shareholders, to understand the company\u2019s results and prospects. This disclosure \nshould aid investors in understanding the company\u2019s value drivers, including sales growth, operating profit \nmargins, and capital needs.  \nPublic companies are expected to adhere to the \u201cmanagement approach,\u201d which says that what information a \ncompany discloses should be consistent with how the company makes decisions and assesses its operations. \nAs a result, divisional analysis can provide investors with insight about business performance through the same \nlens that management uses to make decisions. \nMost companies provide data on divisional, geographic, or segment results. Microsoft, for example, shares \nrevenue and operating profit data for three segments: \u201cProductivity and Business Processes\u201d (think Office 365 \nsubscriptions and LinkedIn), \u201cIntelligent Cloud\u201d (Azure), and \u201cMore Personal Computing\u201d (gaming and Windows \nlicensing). It\u2019s geographic breakdown is simply revenues for the U.S. and \u201cother countries.\u201d The company does \nprovide specific revenue figures for key businesses, including server products and cloud services, Office \nproducts, gaming, LinkedIn, and search. \nDisclosures usually include sales and a measure of profit. Some companies share information about assets and \ncapital expenditures. These are the raw materials you have to work with to build to overall ROIC from the \ndivisions. Here are some things to keep in mind as you dive in to divisional analysis.  \nFirst, the whole has to equal the sum of the parts. You can estimate how each business adds to the aggregate \nwith a sense of each division\u2019s earnings and assets. You can translate assets into invested capital by calculating \nthe ratio for the company overall and assessing how that ratio may vary by division or geography. Microsoft\u2019s \n"

But note the ratio can be very different for various divisions or geographies. You \nhave to figure out how the pieces fit together, but you are always constrained by the aggregate result. \nComparable company analysis can be a useful guide. Consider businesses similar to the division you are \nanalyzing and assess potential similarities and differences. At a minimum, comparable company analysis will \ngenerate valuable questions and provide you with insight about how the businesses operate. \nThe product of your analysis will prepare you for a discussion with management. If they tell you that your \nnumbers are off for one division you can make adjustments knowing that there needs to be an offsetting \nadjustment in another business to square the figure to the whole. Exchanges like this with executives and \ncompetitors will allow you to home in on each division\u2019s ROIC.  \nSmart activist investors are really good at breaking down businesses by ROIC. Doing it well shows where value \nmay be hidden and how capital allocation improvements can add value.  \nReturn on Invested Capital and Competitive Strategy Analysis \nThe calculation of ROIC is an effort to understand a company\u2019s past and prospective ability to create shareholder \nvalue. An ROIC in excess of the cost of capital reflects competitive success that is the result of a strategy. \nUnderstanding how a company achieves its returns can provide guidance in assessing whether they will be \nsustainable.  \nMichael Porter, a professor of strategy at Harvard Business School, identified differentiation and cost leadership \nas generic strategies to gain an advantage. Differentiation means that a company can price its good or service \nat a premium to others. Cost leadership means a company can deliver its offering at a relatively low price.60 \nKnowing how a company generates an attractive ROIC can inform competitive strategy analysis.   \nROIC =  NOPAT\nSales\n x \nSales\nInvested capital \nThe first term on the right side, NOPAT/Sales, is the NOPAT margin. This measures profit per unit. The second \nterm, Sales/Invested capital, is the invested capital turnover. This measures capital efficiency. Sales cancel out \nwhen the terms are multiplied and the result is NOPAT/Invested capital, or ROIC. \nCompanies can have different ways to get to the same ROIC. Retailers provide a clear example. For example, \na retailer that is a cost leader may have a 3 percent NOPAT/Sales ratio and a 6 times Sales/Invested capital \nratio. This would generate an ROIC of 18 percent. A differentiated luxury goods seller, on the other hand, may \nreach the same ROIC with an 18 percent NOPAT/Sales ratio and 1 times invested capital turnover. \nIf a business gets to a high ROIC through a high NOPAT margin, you should focus your analysis on \ndifferentiation. If the company\u2019s high return comes from a high invested capital turnover ratio, emphasize \nanalysis of cost leadership. Rare companies have high NOPAT margins and high invested capital turnover ratios. \nGenerally, those companies have advantages reinforced by economies of scale (see exhibit 17). \n \n \n \n"

This means you \nvalue a financial company by estimating the free cash flows attributable to equity, or FCFE, and discounting \nthem to the present value by the cost of equity capital.  \nThe principle of discounting cash flows applies to all companies. But the proper number to project, and the \nappropriate discount rate, is different for a financial company as compared to a non-financial company.62   \nReturn on equity (ROE) is to financial companies what ROIC is to non-financial firms. The definition of ROE is \nas follows: \nROE =  Adjusted net income \nBook value of equity  \nThe numerator for a typical large bank, adjusted net income, equals net interest income (less provision for credit \nlosses) plus noninterest income (typically comprised of service charges and fees), less expenses (salaries, \nbenefits, etc.) and cash taxes. The denominator, book value of equity, can be taken directly from the balance \nsheet because a bank\u2019s assets and liabilities are supposed to reasonably reflect market values. The issues we \ndiscuss above, including dealing with goodwill and write-offs, are applicable to financials as well. \nM&A. ROIC is an inappropriate way to assess M&A because the cost (invested capital) is reflected immediately \nand the benefit (NOPAT) comes over time. Most deals, even those that create substantial value for the buyer, \nlook poor when viewed through this lens. \nTake a simple example of opening a successful restaurant as a way to think about acquiring a business. Assume \nthe restaurant costs $1 million to open. The ROIC on day one will be awful because the numerator is small and \nthe denominator is large. In the future, ROIC will look extraordinarily good because the numerator will be large \nas the restaurant is running efficiently and the denominator will be small because the assets will have been \ndepreciated. Neither the low initial ROIC nor the high subsequent ROIC tells you whether the restaurant created \nshareholder value. \nThe right way to assess an M&A deal is to do a net present value calculation. The question is whether the \npresent value of future cash flows, including the benefit of synergies, exceeds the purchase price. If so, the deal \ncreates economic value.  \nThere is research that shows that companies that have high ROICs are, on average, better at doing good M&A \ndeals than those that have low ROICs.63 The suggestion is that capital allocation skills apply both internally and \nexternally. \nWhat question ROIC seeks to answer. Aswath Damodaran, the professor of finance, recently expressed \nsubstantial skepticism about the calculation of ROIC, suggesting it is not useful for young companies and that \ncompanies can game the figures.64 The more fundamental issue is that the answer that ROIC gives you can \ndepend a great deal on the question you seek to answer. \nAs we have seen throughout this discussion, there are a number of judgments you have to make to calculate \nROIC in a way that offers insight. These include adjustments for excess cash, capitalization of intangibles, and \nadding back write-offs. The results can differ significantly based on what you choose to measure. For this reason, \ninvestment firms should define ROIC in a consistent manner to make sure that comparisons between companies \nare valid. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6024006 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n29\n \nConclusion \nA company creates value when one dollar invested in the business is worth more than one dollar in the market. \nThis happens when the firm is able to make investments that generate a return above the opportunity cost of \ncapital. Companies pursue strategies, often related to differentiation or cost leadership, that allow them to create \nvalue over time. \nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) is a measure of value creation. The metric is simple in principle. The \nnumerator, net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT), is the cash earnings of a business excluding any financing \ncosts. That means that NOPAT is the same no matter how the company chooses to finance itself. The \ndenominator, invested capital, is equivalently the net assets a company needs to run its business (operating) \nand how it finances those assets (financing). Because balance sheets balance, these approaches are \nequivalent.     \nROIC should be considered relative to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). All capital has an \nopportunity cost, which you can think of as the return on the next best alternative. A company is earning a rate \nabove its opportunity cost when its ROIC exceeds its WACC. Further, the components of ROIC are linked directly \nto free cash flow, the lifeblood of corporate value that is at the core of a discounted cash flow model. \nROIC is conceptually straightforward but a lot of judgment goes into how it is calculated. For example, it is \nadvisable to have a framework for coping with excess cash, restructuring charges, asset write-offs, and share \nbuybacks. \nWe saw that the distribution of ROICs looks like a bell curve in the middle, with the most common result between \n5 and 10 percent, but that there are substantial tails on both sides. Overall, the aggregate ROIC for companies \nin the Russell 3000 has inched higher since the 1990s, with a consistent finding that the largest companies have \nROICs higher than the average. An examination of ROICs by quintiles shows that the ROICs for the top quintile \nimproved substantially since 1990 and the ROICs for the bottom quintile worsened meaningfully. The rise of \nintangibles may help explain both trends.   \nHow to handle intangible investments is the big topic related to ROIC. In recent decades, intangible investments, \nincluding marketing spending and R&D, have become larger than tangible investments such as capital \nexpenditures. The challenge is that most intangible investments are expensed on the income statement, \ndepressing NOPAT, while tangible investments go straight to the balance sheet.  \nCapitalizing intangible investments can change the ROIC materially for intangible-intensive companies. There \nare lots of details to attend to in this exercise as well, including determining what part of selling, general, and \nadministrative expense is justifiably deemed to be an investment and estimating an appropriate useful life. \nThoughtful capitalization of intangible investments does improve the comparability of results across businesses \nin the economy. \nROIC is a snapshot in time. But investors should care a great deal about how ROIC will change over time. We \ncan use the tools we have to measure return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC). Rising ROIICs pull \naggregate ROICs up. That said, a study of base rates shows that ROIC is, in the aggregate, subject to regression \ntoward the mean. That implies that extreme good or bad outcomes will be followed by outcomes with an expected \nvalue closer to the average. Investors should always keep both ideas in mind. Look for increasing returns while \nunderstanding that achieving and sustaining high returns is rare. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6024006 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n30\n \nFor many companies, a relatively modest percentage of the invested capital drives a majority of the value. \nAssessing ROIC by business or geography is one way to discern the source of value. Companies vary in their \ndisclosures, but they are supposed to present information in a way that is consistent with how they manage the \nbusiness. Understanding ROIC by business is a great way to figure out where value resides and where it is \nbeing destroyed. \nA company\u2019s ROIC is determined in part by the industry it competes in and the strategies it pursues. Two generic \nstrategies to achieve competitive advantage include differentiation and cost leadership. ROIC can be broken \ndown into a measure of margins, or profitability per unit (NOPAT/Sales), and capital efficiency (Sales/Invested \ncapital). Attractive ROICs for companies pursuing a differentiation strategy come via high margins. Similarly \ngood ROICs for companies following a cost leadership strategy are the result of above-average capital efficiency. \nA decomposition of ROIC can provide concrete clues about a company\u2019s strategy and serve as a guide for \nstrategic analysis. \nROIC has limitations. For example, the calculation needs to be modified for companies in the financial sector. \nROIC is also a poor way to assess M&A deals. But perhaps the biggest challenge is that ROIC can be calculated \nmany different ways. Two major adjustments are subtracting goodwill and intangible assets that arise from \nacquisitions, and the capitalization of intangible investment. At the end of the day, the approach you use to \ncalculate ROIC should try to answer the question you are asking about the business. \nThe use of ROIC has grown in the corporate and investment communities. But you should never take an ROIC \nfigure at face value without understanding how it was calculated. Investment organizations should agree on a \ncommon approach to determining ROIC and leave room for investors to share additional calculations if they \nbelieve it adds information. \nPlease see important disclosures on pages 42-44. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6024006 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n31\n \nAppendix A: Free Cash Flow and ROIC in a Discounted Cash Flow Model \nThe concepts of free cash flow, ROIC, and economic profit have common roots. Free cash flow, the cash that a \ncompany can distribute to its claimholders, equals NOPAT minus investment. ROIC is NOPAT divided by \ninvested capital, a measure of cumulative net investment. And economic profit is ROIC minus WACC times \ninvested capital and measures a company\u2019s residual income after considering the cost of capital.  \nA discounted cash flow model based either on free cash flow or economic profit will give an identical answer if \nthe inputs are the same and the analysis is done properly. Exhibit 21 shows this equivalence. Our assumptions \nin this example include a starting NOPAT of $250, 8 percent NOPAT growth, initial invested capital of $1,000, a \n14.4 percent ROIIC, and a 7 percent cost of capital. Assuming 10 years of value creation, the corporate value \nin each case is $5,000. \nA few comments are in order. First, it is crucial to use the proper definition of free cash flow, not the one that is \nused most commonly (cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures). The latter fails to reflect \nstock-based compensation as an expense, is after financing costs, and does not capture investments made \nthrough leases. As a result, it is unfit for valuation work without the benefit of numerous adjustments.   \nSecond, the initial invested capital figure, and hence ROIC, does not affect the valuation. We assumed invested \ncapital was $1,000 in this example, but we could have plugged in any number and the outcome would have \nbeen unchanged. The reason is that future cash flows determine value. ROIC is useful only to the degree that \npast results provide some guidance about the future.    \nFinally, take note of the mechanics of the two models. NOPAT is the same and the annual investment determines \nthe change in invested capital. The question is whether one is more informative than the other. It is possible to \ncalculate shareholder value added (SVA) and market-expected return on investment (MEROI) for the first model \nto get a grasp of the magnitude of expected value creation.66 ROIC is clear and easy to see in the second model. \nROIC has its limitations as a financial measure but is consistent with a standard free cash flow model provided \nyou define the value drivers correctly. Introducing a line in the model to estimate ROIC can be helpful as a way \nto make sure that the assumptions accurately capture the expected outcomes.    \n \n"

The adjustment increases NOPAT and investment for any particular year by the same amount, \nbut it also reflects the sum of past intangible investments net of amortization. As a result, the incremental \nincrease in NOPAT was modest relative to the increase in invested capital. \nHere are the numbers for Microsoft. The traditional ROIC is 49 percent, or $70 billion in NOPAT divided by $143 \nbillion of average invested capital. The adjustment adds an ROIC of 11 percent, or $10 billion to NOPAT and \n$90 billion to average invested capital. You can think about it as starting with the high-return part (49% = 70/143) \nand adding a low-return part (11% = 10/90) to get an adjusted total of 34 percent (34% = 80/233).  \nThe math works in the opposite direction for a company that loses money. Without knowing any of the specific \nnumbers, we know that we will start with a negative ROIC because the numerator reflects a loss and that the \nadjustment will add positive ROIC as NOPAT is always revised up. As a result, the aggregate ROIC rises \nfollowing the change. \nLet\u2019s look at Snowflake Inc., a cloud computing-based data warehousing company, to illustrate the point. In fiscal \n2022, the company had NOPAT of negative $704 million (see exhibit 22). A majority of the company\u2019s $1.475 \nbillion in SG&A expense can be deemed an intangible investment, so we know that the adjustment to NOPAT \nwill have a significant effect. We estimate that adjusted NOPAT for 2022 is $52 million.67     \nExhibit 22: Impact of Capitalizing Intangibles on Snowflake\u2019s NOPAT, 2020-2022  \n \nSource: Snowflake Inc. and Counterpoint Global.  \nNote: EBITA = Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization; NOPAT = Net operating profit after taxes. \nThe impact of the adjustment for intangible investment is equally material to invested capital. Exhibit 23 shows \nthat invested capital goes from $230 million to nearly $2.1 billion.  \nThe ROIC is -416 percent in 2022, or negative $704 million of NOPAT divided by $169 million of average \ninvested capital. This figure does not provide much insight. \nThe adjustment adds an ROIC of 51 percent, or $756 million in NOPAT divided by $1.490 billion in average \ninvested capital.

Three percent is not great \nbut it is consistent with a healthy company early in its life cycle. \nThe main point is that adjustments to reflect intangibles tend to pull ROICs closer to the average. A more \naccurate distinction between profits and investments is important in a world where intangible investments are \nsignificant and becoming more so over time.

Let\u2019s say a company buys a store and finances it with debt. It would \nrecord the store as an asset and the debt as a liability. It would then subtract interest expense, a financing cost, \nfrom operating income. Now consider the case of a firm leasing the same store. It would also reflect the store \non the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet according to the new accounting standard. But the lease \ncost would be recorded as an operating, rather than a financing, expense. The adjustment is to reclassify the \nembedded interest portion of the lease cost from the operating section of the income statement to the financing \nsection. This increases NOPAT. Notably, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) properly treats \nthe depreciation and interest expense components of operating lease payments. \n5 Here\u2019s what Northrop Grumman wrote in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. \u201cBeginning in \n2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u2018TCJA\u2019) eliminates the option to deduct research and development \nexpenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to IRC Section 174. \nAlthough Congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, we \nhave no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not modified, \nit will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in 2022.\u201d  \nDuring its conference call for the third quarter of 2021, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Dave Keffer, \nquantified the amount with the following: \u201c\u2026as we've noted in the past, current tax law would require companies \nto amortize R&D costs over five years, starting in 2022, which would increase our cash taxes by around $1 billion \nnext year and smaller amounts in subsequent years. There continues to be uncertainty in the tax environment \nwith potential new legislation that could change the R&D amortization provision and other provisions.\u201d See \nwww.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/northrop-grumman-noc-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcr/. \n6 For example, consider a company with $125,000 in earnings before stock-based compensation, $25,000 in \nstock-based compensation, and a 21 percent tax rate. The pretax income the company reports would be \n$100,000 ($125,000 \u2013 25,000) and the tax provision would be $21,000 ($100,000 \u00d7 .21). But since the stock-\nbased compensation is not deductible, the tax bill would be $26,250 ($125,000 \u00d7 .21). The difference, $5,250, \nis recorded as a tax asset.

The potential change in output reflects the model rather than the reality.  \n50 Aswath Damodaran has posted a webcast on how to do this for R&D. You can use the same process for other \nitems. See www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_UpzqNk3I4.  \n51 In other words, the upward adjustment in NOPAT is inconsistent with the more limited adjustment in invested \ncapital.
