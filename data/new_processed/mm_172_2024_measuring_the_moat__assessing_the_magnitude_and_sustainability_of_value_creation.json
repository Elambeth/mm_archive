Sustainable means a company can find and invest in \nattractive opportunities for a long time.  \nWe can quantify the drivers of sustainable value creation. One \nmeasures the magnitude of the positive spread between return on \ninvested capital (ROIC) and the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) as well as how much the company can invest at that \nspread. The other reflects how long a company can earn that \npositive spread.2 Modeling aggregate value creation for a \ncompany requires considering both dimensions.  \nSustainable value creation is distinct from sustainable competitive \nadvantage, which describes a case when a company generates \nan ROIC above WACC that is also higher than that of its \ncompetitors.3 Multiple companies in the same industry can \nachieve sustainable value creation. For example, rivals Coca-\nCola and PepsiCo are both among the top dozen stocks with the \nhighest long-term returns in the U.S. stock market from 1926 \nthrough 2023.4 Still, sustainable value creation requires that a \ncompany establish a difference that it can maintain.5   \nCreating value for a long time is really hard to do.6 To begin, \ncompanies that can invest a lot at high returns are a magnet for \ncompetition. Empirically, high returns on investment and rapid \ninvestment growth are associated with sharp declines in \nsubsequent returns on investment.7 Next, when end markets \nmature, competitors no longer benefit from market expansion and \ncommonly seek growth by gaining market share, a zero-sum \nsolution. Further, best practices commonly diffuse over time, \nwhich dissipates the differences between firms. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Regression \ntoward the mean says that outcomes that are far from the average are followed by outcomes with an expected \nvalue closer to the average. Exhibit 1 shows regression toward the mean for the ROICs of U.S. companies from \n2013 to 2023. ROICs reverted substantially over the decade.9 \nExhibit 1: Regression Toward the Mean by Quintile for U.S. Companies, 2013-2023 \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global and FactSet. \nNote: Includes companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and NYSE American; Excludes American \ndepositary receipts and companies in the finance sector and those that do not have an ROIC every year; ROICs are based \non the calendar year, adjusted for internally-generated intangible assets, and winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. \nNotwithstanding how hard it is to create value over time, there is lots of evidence that some companies do deliver \npersistently attractive returns on investment.10 And the degree of persistence for public companies in the U.S., \nboth in terms of what they report and what the stock market anticipates, appears to rise and fall over time.11  \nValue creation is important for investors for a number of reasons. One is that the price of a company\u2019s stock \nalmost always anticipates future value creation. You can think of a stock price as having one part that reflects \nthe value of the company operating at a steady state of profit and the other part that captures the value the \ncompany is expected to create or destroy with its future investments.12    \nExhibit 2 shows the breakdown between these parts for the S&P 500, an index of approximately 500 U.S. stocks \nwith the largest market capitalizations, from 1961 to mid-2024. On average, the steady-state value has been \ntwo-thirds of the price and the anticipated value creation the other one-third.13 There have been bouts when the \nprice reflected little or no future value creation (1974 and 2011) as well as significant future value creation (1999 \nand 2001). \n \n \n \n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nMedian ROIC Minus \nUniverse Median (Percent)\n"

We can measure these anticipated financial results \nusing value drivers, including sales growth, operating profit margin, capital expenditures, and working capital \nneeds.  \nBlockbuster Video is a good example of a business affected by a change in the competitive circumstances. In \nthe early 2000s, it was the largest company in the movie rental business, with more than 9,000 stores and a $5 \nbillion equity market capitalization. Notably, about 15 percent of Blockbuster\u2019s sales at its peak came from late \nfees, which customers did not like to pay.15  \nNetflix was launched in the late 1990s and improved the customer proposition for movie rental by mailing digital \nvideo discs (DVDs) directly to households, eliminating late fees, and eventually launching a streaming service \nin 2007. Netflix made the experience of renting a movie vastly more convenient and less onerous. \nNetflix\u2019s disruption of the movie rental business led to a rapid reduction in expectations for Blockbuster, which \nfiled for bankruptcy in 2010, and a sharp increase in expectations for its own business, which had a market \ncapitalization of $290 billion as of mid-2024.      \n \n \n \n \n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1961\n1964\n1967\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\n2015\n2018\n2021\n2024\nPercent\n2 standard deviations\n2 standard deviations\nAverage\n"

Investors commonly call the stocks of these companies \n\u201ccompounders.\u201d Research shows that these stocks generate higher total shareholder returns, adjusted for risk, \nthan what standard asset-pricing models would suggest.16 \nWarren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Berkshire Hathaway, has long used the analogy \nof an economic moat around the business to capture the notion of sustainable competitive advantage. He said \nthat moats should ideally be deep and wide so as to fend off marauders. Further, he has suggested that moats \nare almost always widening or narrowing, even if those changes are hard to perceive in the short run.17 While \nhe seeks businesses that will succeed today as well as over time, he looks for executives who prioritize widening \nthe moat over delivering short-term results.18   \nMorningstar Inc., a financial services firm, uses five perceived sources of moats\u2014network effect, intangible \nassets, cost advantage, switching costs, and efficient scale\u2014and designates an economic moat rating for many \nof the companies of the stocks it follows. They define a company as having a wide moat if its competitive \nadvantage is expected to last for more than 20 years, a narrow moat for 10 to 20 years, and no moat if \ncompetitive advantage is transient or nonexistent.19 \nExhibit 4 shows the distribution of Morningstar\u2019s economic moat ratings from 2002 to mid-2024. Of the more \nthan 1,600 companies evaluated in 2024, about 17 percent were deemed to have a wide moat, with the rest split \nroughly equally between a narrow moat or no moat.  \n \n \n \n \n \nMarket-implied \nexpectations for \nvalue creation\nIndustry \nanalysis\nFirm-specific \nanalysis\nPotential for \nexpectations \nrevisions\n"

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n7\n \nWhy Strategy Matters \nThe spread between ROIC and WACC is a good proxy for value creation, and the stock market tends to reflect \nthis metric.21 ROIC is defined as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by invested capital. You can \nthink of it as how much the company makes (NOPAT) compared to how much it has spent on its business \n(invested capital).  \nHaving a positive ROIC is not enough because capital has an opportunity cost, the value of the next best \nalternative for spending that capital. Imagine the opportunity to acquire two streams of identical cash flows with \none priced to yield 5 percent and the other 7 percent. Allocating capital to the series that earns 5 percent fails to \nearn the opportunity cost of capital because there is an alternative available that earns 7 percent.    \nAnalysis of a company\u2019s strategic position and prospects is not an academic exercise. The goal is to determine \nwhether a company\u2019s strategy will allow it to produce sustainable value creation, which is what the spread \nbetween ROIC and WACC measures.22 Later, we will see how specific strategies can lead to different paths to \nROIC. But for now, we want to emphasize that there is an absolute threshold for value creation. \nIt comes as no surprise that there is a lot of variance in the ROIC-to-WACC spreads for businesses. This is true \nbecause companies are of all ages, have managements with differing skills, compete in a range of industries, \nand pursue distinct strategies.  \nThe top section of exhibit 5 shows the spread between ROIC and WACC for 63 industries in the U.S. in 2023. \n(Appendix A includes ROICs by industry, calculated traditionally and adjusted for internally-generated intangible \nassets, for U.S. companies from 1963-2023.) Some industries have positive spreads, others are roughly neutral, \nand the rest have negative spreads. The bottom of the exhibit features three industries, one with a positive \nspread, one that is neutral, and one with a negative spread, and zooms in on the ROIC-to-WACC spreads of the \ncompanies in those industries.  \nThe striking feature of this exhibit is the similarity between the pieces and the whole. Industries that create value \nin the aggregate nonetheless have companies that have neutral and negative spreads. And industries that \ndestroy value in the aggregate still have companies that create value. This analysis tells us that industry alone \ndoes not seal a company\u2019s fate for value creation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n9\n \nDifferent studies come to a range of conclusions about each of these factors, but broadly company effects \nappear to be the most important, followed by industry and CEO/leadership effects that are in the same range. \nThe year effect seems to be the least important.25 \nA critical point about these studies is that they typically explain less than one-half of the variance. Today\u2019s models \nhave limited explanatory power, whether the result of luck or unidentified factors.      \nThat said, investors can study a meaningful part of corporate performance. And these results suggest that an \nassessment of industry and strategy, captured by the company and CEO/leadership factors, is worthwhile. \nPeter Lynch, who delivered outstanding portfolio returns while running the Magellan Fund at Fidelity \nInvestments, famously quipped, \u201cWhen somebody says, \u2018Any idiot could run this joint,\u2019 that\u2019s a plus as far as I\u2019m \nconcerned, because sooner or later any idiot probably is going to be running it.\u201d26  \nA detailed analysis of leadership is outside the purview of this discussion, but there are a few observations worth \nsharing. First, the dispersion of CEO talent appears to be small among the top 250 companies.27 Second, the \nimpact of leadership varies by industry.28 This may seem inconsistent with the first point, but one way to think \nabout it by analogy is that the impact of coaches varies by sport. For instance, coaches in the National Basketball \nAssociation have a larger impact on outcomes than do managers in Major League Baseball.29 One way to \ninterpret Lynch\u2019s comment is that you want to find businesses where leadership is not the key to success. Finally, \nthere is some evidence that the impact of the CEO has increased over time.30  \nFundamentally, strategy operates at the corporate level and business unit level. A large part of leadership is \nfiguring out where to play (corporate level) and then developing and executing a thoughtful strategy about how \nto play in order to achieve sustainable value creation (business unit). While this discussion may appear to \nsuggest that the firm is the focus of analysis, the proper unit of analysis is each of a company\u2019s strategic business \nunits that operate in a distinct industry. \nThere is also a link between strategy and company life cycle. As we will discuss below, industries tend to pass \nthrough stages as they mature. The evolution through the stages is marked by certain patterns of entry and exit, \nchanges in market share instability, and a shift in focus from product to process innovation. But company life \ncycle is different than industry life cycle because companies can compete in multiple industries that are at stages \nof development that are different from one another.  \nCompany Life Cycles. Company life cycles are commonly depicted anthropomorphically by using age. This is \na limited measure considering that industries move through the life cycle at different rates, some firms learn \nfaster than do their competitors, and age itself can be calculated in multiple ways. Further, the ROICs for \ncompanies sorted by age (assuming birth is the date of the initial public offering) fail to produce the pattern \nassociated with a life cycle of an inverted \u201cU,\u201d with ROIC starting low, reaching an apex, and then drifting lower. \nVictoria Dickinson, a professor of accounting, devised a method to place companies in the life cycle based on \npatterns of results from the statement of cash flows.31 Specifically, she matches the eight (23) possible \ncombinations of inflows or outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities to five stages of the life \ncycle. The stages are introduction, growth, maturity, shake-out, and decline. Nearly three-quarters of companies \nare in the growth or maturity stage over time.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n10\n \nThe virtue of Dickinson\u2019s approach is that companies can move forward or backward through the life cycle. For \nexample, a business in the maturity stage may revert to the growth stage if it identifies an investment opportunity \nin a new industry.  \nWe took Dickinson\u2019s classification scheme and applied it to U.S. companies, excluding companies in the finance \nsector.32 We also made three adjustments to the statement of cash flows to better reflect how companies spend \nand earn. First, we moved stock-based compensation (SBC) from cash flow from operations to cash flow from \nfinancing. Second, we relocated intangible investment from cash flow from operations to cash flow from \ninvesting. Finally, we removed the purchases and sales of marketable securities from cash flow from investing. \nExhibit 6 shows that the approach produces the pattern we associate with the life cycle. The exhibit also provides \nvital statistics by stage, including ROIC, age (both since the date of founding and of the initial public offering), \nand sales growth rates. Our research also measures transitions from one stage to another and the associated \ntotal shareholder returns.   \nWe would add that defining what constitutes an industry, or accurately measuring related concepts such as \nmarket concentration or market share, can be very tricky. At a high level, analysts can consider companies to \nbe in the same industry if they have common suppliers and buyers or similar competitive intent.

The \nvertical, or y-axis measures price and the horizontal, or x-axis is quantity. The demand curve represents the \nwillingness to pay (WTP) of consumers. WTP is the maximum amount a consumer is willing to spend on a good \nor service. Consumers vary in their WTP, but overall demand for a good or service is low when the price is high \nand high when the price is low. The supply curve captures the cost, or willingness to sell (WTS), for producers. \nWTS is the minimum amount a supplier will accept to provide a good or service. Suppliers will provide lots of a \ngood or service when prices are high and will not produce as much when prices are low. \nExhibit 7: Supply and Demand Curves and Competitive Equilibrium \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nWhen there is perfect competition, the point at which the demand and supply curves meet determines the price \nof the good or service. This is where willingness to pay and the marginal cost of production intersect. The price \nreaches this point because the producer with the lowest cost will drop its price to that level to gain market share. \nThe marginal cost includes the cost of capital. \nIn this idealized world, ROIC equals WACC and companies neither create nor destroy shareholder value. Note, \ntoo, that consumers with a willingness to pay above the clearing price enjoy a surplus. Economists measure this \nwith utility, which reflects satisfaction. The triangle in the upper left corner quantifies this aggregate value. \nBut strategy is about figuring out how to create value. This means achieving what economists call \u201cmarket \npower,\u201d or \u201cthe ability of a firm to raise prices above costs and generate excess profits.\u201d34 Economists measure \nthis with what they call a \u201cmarkup.\u201d The industries and companies in exhibit 5 that have positive spreads between \nROIC and WACC can be said to have market power as quantified with markups.  \nCompetitive \nPrice\nConsumer \nSurplus\nDemand\nSupply\nSupply\nDemand\nMarginal \nCost\nCompetitive \nQuantity\nPrice\nQuantity\n"

The triangle that was all consumer surplus in exhibit 7 is now broken into three \nparts. Consumer surplus still exists but there is less of it. There is also welfare loss, which reflects the loss to \nconsumers who have a willingness to pay between the higher price and the marginal cost, and would have \npurchased the good or service at the marginal cost.   \nBut we now have an economic profit for producers. Strategy is about figuring out a way to earn that economic \nprofit in a sustainable way. Note that even this simple analysis reveals that companies can add value by \nincreasing willingness to pay (shifting the demand curve), lowering costs (shifting the supply curve), or doing \nboth at the same time.  \nExhibit 8: Supply and Demand Curves and Competitive Equilibrium \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nSome economists have argued that markups, measured using sales and cost of goods sold, have risen in the \nU.S. This has raised concerns about the competitiveness of markets.

This \nanalysis allows a company to figure out how to position itself to thrive. We place special emphasis on two of the \nforces: threat of new entrants and rivalry among existing firms.  \nNew businesses can disrupt companies that have strong competitive positions. Understanding how this happens \nis useful, as we saw with the prior discussion about Blockbuster Video and Netflix. We also touch on when \nvertical or horizontal integration makes more sense for an industry or company.  \nIndustry Map. Constructing an industry map is a good place to start the analysis of an industry.36 Exhibit 9 is \nan example for the U.S. airline industry. The goal is to include all of the companies or entities that may have an \nimpact on the profitability of the firm you are analyzing. Suppliers, which provide the firm with its inputs, are \ntypically on the left side of the map. Customers, the purchasers of goods or services, are on the right. We also \nconsider factors such as government regulations, tariffs, and labor markets.  \nWe recommend listing firms in each section in terms of market share so that relative size is immediately evident. \nFurther, it is useful to include potential new entrants to the degree that they can be identified or contemplated.  \nIt is also important to understand the nature of the economic interactions between the organizations on the map. \nFor example, relationships may be non-contractual (travelers buying airline tickets), contractual (software-as-a-\nservice), a cost-plus contract (government acquiring defense systems), a best-efforts contract (an investment \nbank underwriting a security for an issuer), a license (a movie based on a doll), an option (an airline purchasing \naircraft), or some other arrangement. Identifying potential agency costs is also useful. These costs arise when \nan agent, a party acting on behalf of another firm that is the principal, takes actions that harm the principal.  \nFinally, the map will ideally include any other factors that might affect the profitability of the focal firm. For airlines, \nthese might include overall economic conditions, geopolitical risks, climate change, and global pandemics.    \nResearch shows investors may profit from understanding the connections that industry maps identify.37 \nSpecifically, when shocks to one firm in the system affect other companies, because of either supply or demand \nlinks, the market often fails to reflect the information on a timely basis. This produces an opportunity to trade \nprofitably. Further, sell-side equity analysts who follow suppliers and customers produce earnings forecasts that \nare more accurate on average than analysts who follow only suppliers.38 \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Now that we have a sense of the relevant companies and entities in an industry, we turn to \nunderstanding how the economic profit is distributed among the participants. Creating a profit pool is an effective \ntool for this analysis.39 \nEconomic profit equals the spread between ROIC and WACC times invested capital (Economic Profit = [ROIC \n\u2212 WACC] \u00d7 Invested Capital). In a profit pool, the difference between ROIC and WACC is on the y-axis, and \ninvested capital is on the x-axis.  \nThe way to interpret a profit pool is that the y-axis shows value creation as a percent (width), and the x-axis \nshows how much money is invested (length). The economic profit for a company equals its area (width \u00d7 length). \nAt a glance, a business analyst can see where the money is being made.  \nExhibit 10 is a profit pool for the full aviation industry for 2022. A majority of the invested capital is in airlines and \nairports, both of which have negative economic profit. Some businesses, including fuel production and freight \nforwarders, do have positive economic profit, but their invested capital is relatively small. In the aggregate, the \neconomic profit for this collection of businesses was negative $69 billion in 2022.40 \nExhibit 10: Aviation Industry Profit Pool by Activity, 2022 \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global based on IATA, \u201cAviation Value Chain: An Analysis of Investor Returns in 2022 within the \nAviation Value Chain,\u201d IATA Brief, February 15, 2024 and Jaap Bouwer, Vik Krishnan, Nina Lind, and Steve Saxon, \n\u201cChecking in on the Aviation Value Chain\u2019s Recovery,\u201d McKinsey & Company, October 25, 2023. \nNote: ANSP = Air navigation service provider and GDS = Global distribution system. \nA few points are useful to bear in mind when using profit pool analysis. First, looking at results over a business \ncycle is generally instructive because it reduces the impact of short-term or cyclical factors.41 Second, periodic \nsnapshots can indicate how competitive dynamics change over time. Specifically, profit pools show the evolution \nof a company\u2019s absolute and relative economic profit.  \nFinally, large profit pools may indicate opportunities or threats. It has been reported that \u201cyour margin is my \nopportunity\u201d was a favorite aphorism of Jeff Bezos, founder and executive chairman of Amazon.42 Bezos\u2019s \nmaxim suggests a company\u2019s large economic profit may draw competitors seeking to capture some of that profit. \nThe threat is that challengers are constantly trying to drain the biggest profit pools.43     \n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nROIC minus WACC (Percent) \nShare of Industry Invested Capital\nAirlines\nManufacturers\nANSPs\nAirports\nFreight \nforwarders\n100%\nMaintenance\nLessors\nGround services\nGDS\nFuel production\nCatering\n"

The industry was still recovering from the large negative shock caused by the COVID-19 \npandemic. Notably, Delta and United still produced positive economic profit. \nExhibit 12 shows that from 1963 to 2023, the U.S. airline industry has failed to earn a consistently positive spread \nbetween ROIC and WACC. We discuss below the forces that determine the structure of the airline industry.  \nExhibit 12: ROIC and ROIC \u2013 WACC for the U.S. Airline Industry, 1963-2023 \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global, Compustat, and FactSet. \nNote: ROICs are based on aggregate amounts, are adjusted for internally-generated intangible assets, and reflect fiscal \nyears for 1985-1996 and calendar years for 1997-2023. \nIn reviewing profit pools over time, consider whether there is a narrative that explains how and why the aggregate \neconomic profit has changed as well as how those profits have been divvied up among the companies.  \nMarket Share Instability. The simple premise of this analysis is that market share stability is favorable for \nsustainable value creation and instability makes it harder for any individual company to consistently create value. \nSources of instability include new entrants, technological change, shifts in consumer demand, and competitive \nactions such as price cuts.45 Market share instability measures mobility within an industry and helps explain the \nnature of rivalry.46  \nWhile methods to measure market share instability have been around for more than a half century, Bruce \nGreenwald, an emeritus professor of finance at Columbia Business School, taught an approach based on the \naverage absolute value of the change in market share.47 In this analysis, you observe the market shares for \neach company within an industry over two periods, usually three to five years apart, and calculate the absolute \nvalue of the change for each. You use those figures to determine the average absolute value change.

Another relevant dynamic is the distribution of market shares. Concentration \nquantifies how much market share different companies control in an industry. The most popular measure of \nconcentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). The HHI is the sum of the squares of the market shares \nof each firm, which allows it to reflect inequality. Another metric is the total market share held by a specific \nnumber of competitors. So an index of the top four firms (C4) would capture the combined market shares of \nthose competitors. HHI and C4 give answers that are often, but not always, similar. \nWhy concentration goes up or down is vital. For example, concentration can rise because some companies \noperate more efficiently than their competitors. This allows them to supply an offering at a more attractive price \nor with better quality, leading to an increase in market share. For markets with strong network effects, when the \nvalue of a good or service increases as more people use it, some companies can gain an advantage in consumer \ndemand. These advantages are commonly the result of skill and luck and can precede a winner-take-most \noutcome and a rise in concentration. In these cases, concentration increases even when competition is spirited.  \nConcentration can also rise because of industry consolidation, which introduces the possibility of higher prices \nwithout an accompanying improvement in the quality of the offerings. This can limit competition and introduce \nthe prospect of antitrust scrutiny.  \nConcentration can also fall as the result of new entrants as well as specific antitrust actions or changes in \nregulation. For example, the government broke up AT&T in 1984 as an antitrust remedy and deregulated the \nairline industry in 1978. \nMeasuring concentration is inherently difficult because various techniques yield different answers and properly \ndefining a market is hard. But the main issue is that common measures of concentration are not reliably linked \nto sustainable value creation or stock returns.48 Market share provides a better link to profitability than does \nconcentration.49  \nIndustry Structure Classification. We find it useful to categorize industries at a high level before delving into \nthe details of industry structure. While the analytical framework for all industries is common, categorization offers \nguidance on which topics you should emphasize. Strategy is always about finding sustainable value creation, \nbut the issues faced by the executives in an emerging industry will be different than those for leaders in a \ndeclining industry.

Michael Porter developed the five-forces framework to provide a rigorous way to analyze \nthe structure of an industry. There are a number of points to consider before starting this analysis:50 \n\u2022 The goal is not to determine whether an industry is attractive but rather to understand the drivers of \nprofitability. Specifically, you can assess each force in the context of what it means for prices and costs. \nThis analysis includes consideration of the income statement and the balance sheet. \n\u2022 Strategy is not about a company beating its competitors. It is about figuring out how to earn a sustainable \neconomic profit. Interactions with competitors are important, but so are relationships with customers, \nsuppliers, and complementors. \n\u2022 As with profit pool analysis, you want to separate what is structural from what is temporary or cyclical. \nPorter argues that underlying change is quite limited after an industry goes through its emerging stage. \n\u2022 The structure by no means seals the fate of the companies in the industry, as we saw already. Sustainable \nvalue creation is the result of defending against and shaping competitive forces to establish an advantage. \n\u2022 Much of what is put forth as analysis of industry structure is simply listing pluses and minuses for each of \nthe forces. The objective is to go beyond the superficial to get a complete view of the drivers of profit.   \nExhibit 17 shows the five forces: threat of new entrants, rivalry among existing firms, bargaining power of \nsuppliers, bargaining power of buyers, and the threat of substitutes. While all of the forces are important, we \nbelieve that threat of new entrants and rivalry among existing firms deserve more extensive consideration than \nthe others. In particular, we will examine barriers to entry, what impedes additional firms from seeking to \ncompete, in some detail. But first we start with a brief look at the bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining \npower of buyers, and the threat of substitutes.51 \nExhibit 17: Five Forces That Shape Industry Structure \nThreat of New Entrants \nRisk: New competitors erode market share and profitability. \nMitigant: Establish strong barriers to entry. \nRivalry Among Existing Firms \nRisk: Intense competition reduces profitability. \nMitigant: Avoid direct competition and promote legal cooperation. \nBargaining Power of Suppliers \nRisk: Strong suppliers increase input costs and squeeze margins. \nMitigant: Diversify supplier base and consider vertical integration. \nBargaining Power of Buyers \nRisk: Strong buyers are demanding and limit profitability. \nMitigant: Differentiate and promote customer loyalty. \nThreat of Substitutes \nRisk: Substitutes offer products that limit industry profitability. \nMitigant: Innovate, improve products, and create switching costs. \nSource: Counterpoint Global based on Michael E.

An industry that cannot pass on price increases from its powerful suppliers \nis destined to be unattractive. Suppliers are well positioned if they are more concentrated than the industry \nthey serve, if substitute products do not burden them, or if their offerings have high switching costs. They \nare also well situated if they represent a relatively small percentage of the total input costs of the buyers \nthey sell to or if the product or service is critical to the buyer. \nLabor, fuel, and airplane ownership and maintenance are the three largest input costs for airlines. Michael \nPorter concludes that the bargaining power of suppliers is high because many airline employees are \nmembers of labor unions, airframe and aircraft engine manufacturers are oligopolies, and airports operate \nas local monopolies.52  \n\u2022 Bargaining power of buyers is the negotiating strength of the buyers of a product or service. It is a \nfunction of buyer concentration, switching costs, levels of information, substitute products, and the \nimportance of the offering to the buyer. Large buyers that are informed have much more leverage over \ntheir suppliers than do diffused buyers that are uninformed. \nPorter\u2019s study of airlines shows that the bargaining power of buyers of airline travel is also high because \nthe buyers are largely fragmented, have low switching costs (offset to some degree by frequent flier \nprograms), have the means to compare fares easily, and are price sensitive as they perceive air travel to \nbe a relatively standard offering.53 \n\u2022 Threat of substitutes addresses the existence of substitute products or services, as well as the likelihood \nthat a potential customer will adopt a substitute product. A business faces a substitution threat if its prices \nare not competitive and if comparable products are available from other companies. Substitute products \nlimit the prices that companies can charge and place a ceiling on potential returns. \nPorter\u2019s work shows this threat to be medium for airlines. Travel by train or car can substitute for short-\nhaul flights, and business meetings via videoconferencing can replace some face-to-face gatherings.54   \nThe threat of new entrants is the force that some scholars consider to be the most important. For example, \nBruce Greenwald called it \u201cthe one force that dominates all the others.\u201d55 High barriers to entry allow incumbents \nto create value while discouraging potential entrants with the prospect of unsatisfactory economic profits. Low \nbarriers to entry suggest that challengers have limited obstacles in competing for a share of economic profits. \nIn our view, investors and executives often underappreciate the importance of historical entry and exit data for \nan industry. Those outcomes provide practical evidence of the existence of entry, and exit, barriers. For this \nreason, we recommend examining the history of entry and exit early in the process of analyzing an industry. \nAt a high level, barriers to entry are either structural or strategic.56 Structural advantages come from scale \nbenefits that lead to lower costs, access to scarce resources, or regulation. Strategic barriers are the result of \nactions incumbents take to fend off or discourage entrance. We explore these factors in more detail below. \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n24\n \nA review of the empirical research on entry and exit provides some stylized facts and a sense of how important \nit is in assessing sustainable value creation. One study looked at more than 250,000 U.S. manufacturing firms \nfrom 1963 to 1982. This study is old but remains instructive.57  \nTo get a sense of the findings from this research, imagine an industry in 2025 with 100 firms that each have \nsales of $1 million. If past patterns are predictive, we should expect that:  \n\u2022 Entry and exit will be common. Thirty to 45 firms will enter the industry in the next 5 years and will \ncollectively end up with sales of $15-$20 million. Just under one-half of the entrants will be diversified \nfirms seeking to extend into new segments and a little over one-half will be new. Over that period, 30 to \n40 companies with combined revenues of $15-$20 million will exit. That translates into 30-45 percent \nturnover in industry participants affecting 15-20 percent of volume in the industry.  \n\u2022 Companies that enter and exit are generally smaller than the average existing firm. New entrants \nare on average about 30 percent of the size of existing firms. Firms that diversify into an industry are about \nthe same size as the companies already there. Firms that exit by 2030 will be about one-third as large as \nthe firms that remain.  \n\u2022 There is a lot of variance in entry and exit rates by industry. Entry rates are higher in profitable and \ngrowing industries. Exit rates are higher in industries that are mature or in decline. \n\u2022 Survival rates over ten years are low. On average, roughly 60 percent of the new entrants in a 5-year \nperiod have exited within the next 5 years. Nearly 80 percent of those firms, on average, exit within 10 \nyears.   \nThe data in the study were through the early 1980s. Exhibit 18 shows the rate of entry and exit for U.S. \nestablishments across all industries from 1978 to 2022. Establishments are a single physical location where \nbusiness is conducted. Most firms, especially young ones, have one establishment. Larger firms typically own \nmultiple establishments. Not all exits are failures. Some are the sale of a viable business and others are closures \nof successful companies.58  \nExhibit 18: Establishment Entry and Exit Rates, 1978-2022 (U.S.) \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global and U.S. Census Bureau\u2014Business Dynamics Statistics. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nPercent\nEntry\nExit\nExit\nEntry\n"

Early in the life of the industry, the \nmarket has yet to pick the products it wants. This is an invitation for new firms to enter the industry and innovate. \nFew companies exit. After the market picks the products it wants, demand stabilizes and entry and exit are in \nrough balance. In the latter stages of industry life, demand ebbs and exits tend to outpace entrants. Appendix B \nprovides more detail on the pattern of industry development.61  \nBarriers to entry determine how difficult it is for a new competitor to enter an industry. These barriers might \ninclude the level of capital required, the strength of established brands and customer loyalty, access to \ndistribution channels, economies of scale, the costs of switching from one supplier to another, and government \nregulations. \nMichael Porter\u2019s analysis of the airline industry concludes that the threat of new entrants is high, reflecting limited \nadvantages for incumbents, low switching costs, and easy access to distribution channels. That said, barriers to \nentry include sizeable capital requirements to acquire aircraft, regulatory costs, and limited access to airport \ngates and takeoff and landing slots.62  \nExhibit 21 shows entry and exit in the U.S. airline industry from 1978 to 2003. The industry was deregulated in \n1978, which led to a rise in new entrants in the next half-dozen years. Most of these upstarts failed. Since 2003, \nthe number of U.S. airlines has declined 15 to 20 percent, primarily due to consolidation, and market \nconcentration has risen. From 2005 to 2013, five relatively large airlines\u2014Northwest, Continental, US Airways, \nAmerica West, and AirTran\u2014were acquired or merged. New entrants such as Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, \nand GoJet Airlines partially offset those exits.  \nExhibit 21: U.S. Airline Industry Entry and Exit, 1978-2003 \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global and William A.

Porter enumerates seven sources of barriers that protect incumbents: \nsupply-side economies of scale, capital requirements, demand-side benefits of scale, customer switching costs, \nincumbency advantages independent of size, unequal access to distribution channels, and restrictive \ngovernment policy.65 Firms derive their specific advantages from these barriers. \nEconomies of scale reflect the relationship between a company\u2019s sales and fixed costs, which are costs that \ndo not change with output. Adam Smith described this in The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, using the \nexample of a pin factory.66 The cost per unit goes down as output goes up for most industries (exhibit 23) up to \na point.

These parts are indivisible, and the bakery must absorb \ntheir fixed costs no matter the level of demand for its products. As important, fixed costs will not budge much if \ndemand rises and the trucks go from half to completely full.  \nMinimum efficient scale (MES) is the level of output at which a firm reaches its long-term average cost.69 Since \nmost entrants are smaller than incumbents, MES indicates how much market share an entrant must gain to \nachieve a cost structure that can lead to a satisfactory economic profit. \nYou can combine MES with two other concepts to derive important insights into industry structure.70 First is the \nlink between MES and the total addressable market (TAM), the sales a company could attain if it had 100 percent \nshare of a market it could serve while creating value.71 If you have a sense of the market share necessary to \nachieve MES and the TAM, you can estimate how many companies can compete while creating value. \nBear in mind that scale is always relative to competitors. Big firms in a large industry may have no advantage \nwhen compared to one another. For example, 6 auto producers had a market share between roughly 10 and 15 \npercent in the U.S. in 2023, and each of those companies had global sales in excess of $100 billion. Conversely, \na little firm in a small industry may have an advantage. MES and TAM can change over time as the result of \nshifts in consumer preferences and advances in technology.  \nThe second link is between MES and market share changes. Market share instability analysis provides a \nmeasure of how much market share moves around in an industry. Potential entrants face a daunting task if the \nmarket share to achieve MES is high and market shares are stable.  \nCapital requirements quantify how much capital an entrant has to commit up front and include pre-production \ncosts as well as the drain of prospective losses. When the minimum efficient scale of production is high relative \nto the size of the total market, a potential entrant is looking at the daunting prospect of pricing its product below \nits average cost for some time to get to scale.  \nOutput\nCost per \nUnit\nMinimum \nEfficient \nScale\n"

For example, in \n2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company announced that it is committing $65 billion to build three \nnew semiconductor fabrication plants in the U.S.72 The unit cost for the first chip the company will produce will \nbe extremely high but the cost per unit will decline rapidly as the fabs reach production at scale. \nToday, companies invest roughly twice as much in intangible assets as tangible assets.73 The academic \ncommunity has focused a great deal of attention on \u201csuperstar\u201d firms, companies that have achieved better \nROICs, growth, and productivity than their peers.74 Intangible investments have played an important role in the \nrise of these superstars.  \nJames Bessen, an economist, suggests that three developments have allowed superstar firms to distance \nthemselves from their competitors. First, these companies invest heavily in proprietary software, a form of \nintangible asset. He shows that spending for this software has grown at a much faster rate than that for research \nand development (R&D), advertising, and acquisitions.75 Spending on proprietary software is in excess of $300 \nbillion in the U.S.76 \nSecond, he contends that this software has allowed superstar firms to not only benefit from economies of scale \nbut also to offer the market differentiated goods and services. Companies have traditionally been encouraged \nto distinguish themselves from their competitors through either lower costs or distinctive offerings. Proprietary \nsoftware enables large firms to benefit from scale and complexity in a way that was impossible before.77  \nFinally, this technology diffuses at a slower rate today than in the past because the software is complex and \ncustomized, and superstar firms have little incentive to share what they have built. This has made it hard for \ncompetitors to narrow the productivity gap and increases the minimum efficient scale and capital requirements \nfor potential challengers.78 \nDemand-side benefits of scale, commonly linked to network effects, create another important barrier to entry. \nA network effect exists when the value of a good or service grows as more members use that good or service. \nThe ridesharing market, which connects riders and drivers, is a clear example. The utility of Uber, a ridesharing \ncompany, increases for riders when there are lots of drivers and for drivers when there are lots of riders.  \nThis is called a \u201cdemand-side\u201d benefit because the more demand (and users) there is the more valuable the \nservice becomes. Positive feedback often allows one network to prevail. For example, Uber had about 75 \npercent of the rideshare market in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2024.79 A network\u2019s strength and durability are \na function of its size, structure, and connectivity.80 We will address network effects again when we discuss how \nfirms create value.  \nCustomer switching costs are what buyers or users have to endure to move from one supplier to another. \nThese costs can be direct (e.g., cancellation or initiation fees), indirect (time and effort to find a new supplier), \nor psychological (inconvenience and uncertainty). Many consumers do not want to leave a dominant network \nbecause of high switching costs. This lock-in makes it difficult for a challenger to gain customers.  \nAsset specificity creates another form of switching cost. Indeed, economists have noted that how specific the \nassets are to the business may be more important than the sum invested. Assets are specific if they are hard to \ndeploy elsewhere. Companies usually invest in specific assets to satisfy particular customer needs.  \nAsset specificity takes a number of forms, including site specificity (e.g., a company locates its assets close to \none another to capture efficiencies), physical specificity (a firm\u2019s investments are meant for a particular \n"

This dependence creates a cost for the customer to switch to another supplier.  \nIncumbency advantages independent of size can take a number of forms, including precommitment \ncontracts, licenses and patents, quasi-contracts, and learning curves.  \nCompanies commonly safeguard future business through long-term contracts.82 These precommitment \ncontracts can be efficient in reducing search costs for both the supplier and the customer. They also make entry \nmore difficult.  \nPrecommitment contracts take different forms. One is if an incumbent secures access to an essential input. For \ninstance, in March 2024, Amazon purchased a datacenter from Talen Energy that included a long-term contract \nfor energy from Talen\u2019s nearby nuclear power plant.83 There are concerns that energy demands from \ndatacenters, especially for clean energy, will outstrip what the current the U.S. infrastructure can supply.84  \nPrecommitment also includes quasi-contracts, such as a pledge to always provide a good or service at the \nlowest cost. For example, Walmart, a multinational retailer, vows to have \u201cEvery Day Low Prices\u201d on a wide \nassortment of goods in its U.S stores. Such a pledge reduces the potential payoff for new entrants because they \nseldom have the scale to match incumbents.  \nIncumbents also have the advantage of learning by doing. The idea is that organizations improve at an activity \nthe more they do it. Theodore Wright, an engineer, formalized this into what is now called Wright\u2019s Law, which \nsays that the labor hours per unit decline 20 percent for each doubling of cumulative output.85 The cost of \nproduction for solar panels and lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles have both followed Wright\u2019s Law closely. \nUnequal access to distribution channels is relevant when an entrant has to have distribution for its good or \nservice. For example, retailers seek to allocate their shelf space to optimize product turnover and profits. As a \nresult, entrants commonly have to pay the retailer a fee to provide their offering with a slot on the shelf.  \nRestrictive government policy can take the form of licenses and patents. Many industries, including \nhealthcare, transportation, and broadcasting, require a license or certification from the government to do \nbusiness. These are a cost that impede entry.  \nPatents provide the owner the legal right to keep competitors from producing and selling an invention for some \nperiod. Pharmaceutical patents in the U.S., for instance, commonly last for 20 years from the date of application. \nThe purpose of a patent is to provide an appropriate return on innovation, which can involve large upfront costs.  \nRegulatory capture occurs when government entities that are supposed to serve the broad population adopt \npolicies that help certain companies or industries. For example, Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist, describes how \nincumbent telecommunications companies used lobbyists to draft and promote legislation to quash the \naspirations of a company in which he had invested. The company created a mesh that provided Wi-Fi to cities. \nThe product was popular among mayors and the general public but threatened the local telecom providers. \nGurley concludes that \u201cregulation is the friend of the incumbent.\u201d86   \nPotential entrants into an industry must consider these barriers in assessing the potential payoffs. They should \nalso include the costs and barriers to exit. High exit costs are also a deterrent to entry. High costs come from \n"

Notably, many tangible assets are less specific than are intangible \nassets.87 Standardization explains much of this difference. Tangible assets are often standard and intangible \nassets are generally unique. For companies that failed during the dot-com bust, the chairs the engineers sat in \nmay have been worth more than the code they wrote. \nNaturally, incumbents also seek to deter entry preemptively. Strategies include cutting the cost of existing \nproducts, adding capacity, signaling an aggressive response, and pursuing legal or regulatory strategies.88 The \nfinancial position of incumbents is also relevant. Financially strong firms are in the position to take a short-term \nhit to profits to avoid having a new competitor for the long term.  \nThe specific ways that companies achieve sustainable value creation reflect directly on what barriers to entry \nthey enjoy. Below, we explicitly link the various forms of barriers to entry to specific ways that firms can add \nvalue.  \nRivalry among existing firms, the last of the forces, measures how aggressively firms compete with one \nanother in an industry. The weapons of rivalry include pricing, service offerings, capacity changes, new products, \nadvertising, and promotional spending. \nMost industries have a tension between coordinating, and hence maximizing industry profits, and cheating, \nwhere one or more companies may benefit at the expense of competitors. Examples of coordination are \nsynchronized price changes, done through signaling rather than discussion, and restrained changes in industry \ncapacity. Cases of cheating are price cuts, either directly or through promotions, and large unilateral increases \nin capacity. In all cases, companies must be aware that their actions trigger reactions by their competitors.  \nRivalry tends to be more intense when there are lots of competitors and they are of equal size. The reason is \nsimilar to why the diffusion of responsibility leads to less accountability in a group. Each company perceives \nitself as relatively insignificant and therefore does not worry about the reactions of others as it lowers prices or \nincreases its capacity. The likelihood of coordination rises when the industry has a few large companies that can \nmonitor and signal to one another.89  \nRivalry is also intense when competing companies seek to become the network of choice in a business with \nstrong network effects. This competition can be especially heated if the firms seek to subsidize one side of the \nmarket. An example is rival rideshare companies issuing large discounts to passengers in order to attract drivers \nand reduce wait times.90 These subsidies can be very expensive and especially so when venture capital is \nample.91 \nIndustry growth also influences rivalry. Economic profit tends to increase over time for a profitable industry that \nemerges, which means that competitors can do well if they sustain their share of the pie. Economic profit \nstagnates or falls when an industry has slow growth, no growth, or is in decline. That means the setup has a \nzero sum because one firm\u2019s gain has to be another firm\u2019s loss.  \nDemand variability also affects rivalry. It is hard for companies to coordinate with each other in industries that \nhave cyclical demand, even if overall demand is rising, because it is a challenge for companies to coordinate \ninternally. That internal focus shrinks the possibility of external coordination.  \nCyclical industries are particularly challenging because all competitors are tempted to add capacity, or raise \nprices, near the peak. A company that adds capacity stands to earn incremental economic profit if others do not. \nBut capacity additions near the peak of the market make the overcapacity at the trough more painful. This is \n"

Operating leverage \nmeasures the change in profit as a function of the change in sales.  \nCooperation tends to emerge when companies frequently interact with one another and therefore learn how to \nsend and receive signals. One difficulty with cyclical industries is that meaningful decisions to add capacity or \nnot are relatively infrequent, and any absence of institutional memory can lead to a decision that ultimately harms \nindustry profitability. \nThe strategies and tactics that companies pursue also reflect the heterogeneity of ownership structures and \nresulting goals. Companies can be public, privately held, or owned by a venture capital or buyout firm. These \nowners may differ in their time horizons, financial sophistication, and incentive structures. Those differences can \naffect how companies compete.92 \nHigh barriers to exit also have an impact on rivalry. Competitors are more likely to stick it out and try to compete \nif it is costly to leave an industry. Here again, asset specificity is relevant. Assets that companies cannot deploy \nelsewhere create a barrier to exit.  \n \n"

Much of strategy research focuses on the attractiveness of industry structure or how \ncompanies achieve and sustain a competitive advantage. But a lot of companies that were highly successful \nand widely admired, including Sears, Eastman Kodak, and Nokia, subsequently failed. Clayton Christensen, a \nprofessor of management, wanted to understand how incumbents with sizable resources were unsuccessful in \nfending off upstarts with relatively modest resources. His work on disruptive innovation seeks to explain why the \nGoliaths sometimes lose to the Davids.93 \nThe theory of disruptive innovation is not without controversy, especially in the academic community.94 But \npractitioners have embraced the ideas, even if they have overapplied and misused the term \u201cdisruptive.\u201d These \npoints noted, we find the theory useful when applied thoughtfully. \nChristensen distinguishes between \u201csustaining\u201d and \u201cdisruptive\u201d innovations. A sustaining innovation improves \na product and can be incremental, discontinuous, or even radical. The essential point is that these innovations \nappear in a company\u2019s current \u201cvalue network.\u201d Christensen defines a value network as the \u201ccontext within which \na firm identifies and responds to customers\u2019 needs, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors, and \nstrives for profit.\u201d95 You can think of a value network as a business model.96 \nA disruptive innovation serves the same market but uses a different business model. Often, but not always, \ndisruptive innovations are simpler and cheaper than what mainstream customers demand, so the products or \nservices appeal initially to only a small percentage of users. Christensen conceded that he made a mistake in \noriginally calling this \u201cdisruptive technology.\u201d He later modified the name to \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d because \u201cit is \na business model problem, not a technology problem.\u201d Disruptive innovation occurs when \u201cthe disruptive \nbusiness model in which the technology is deployed paralyzes the incumbent leader.\u201d97 \nHamilton Helmer, a business strategist, enumerates seven powers, including one he calls \u201ccounter-positioning.\u201d \nWe consider disruptive innovation and counter-positioning to be similar. Helmer says counter-positioning is \nrelevant when: \u201cA newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due \nto the anticipated damage to their existing business.\u201d98  \nThe concept of a disruptive innovation is relative. What may be disruptive to one business may be sustaining to \nanother. For instance, the emergence of the internet was a sustaining innovation for retailers that relied on mail \norder catalogs. Their basic business model did not change. But the internet was disruptive for retailers that had \nphysical stores.  \nIn 2024, the relative impact of innovation is at the heart of the discussion about generative artificial intelligence \n(GenAI), a technology that generates text, images, or videos via prompts. Leading technology companies and \nsome startups are each spending tens of billions of dollars to develop their own GenAI models.  \nStrategists are already arguing that GenAI will have a significant impact on the business of these companies but \n\u201cwon\u2019t be a source of competitive advantage for any one of them.\u201d They note, however, that GenAI may amplify \nexisting competitive advantages.99  \nIn general, we find that disruptors have lower profit margins, but higher invested capital turnover, than the \nincumbents. We saw that ROIC equals net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by invested capital. \nProfit margins are measured as NOPAT/sales and invested capital turnover equals sales/invested capital. \n"

Low-end disruptors \nenter a market that exists already. Southwest Airlines launched in the U.S. airline industry in the late 1960s with \na small number of cheap flights from smaller airports and no frills. It did not seek to compete with the legacy \ncarriers and in fact was a substitute for bus transportation.  \nNew-market disruptors compete initially against \u201cnon-consumption.\u201d100 They create a market for consumers who \nlack the funds to buy, or the skills to use, the incumbent\u2019s product or service. The personal computer (PC) is a \nclassic example. Before the launch of PCs in the mid-1970s, computers were too big, expensive, and \ncomplicated for personal use. \nExhibit 24 shows the model of disruptive innovation. The y-axis is consumer needs for product performance and \nthe x-axis is time. The two bell-shaped distributions represent customer expectations for product performance, \nwhich tend to rise over time. The distributions reflect that there are customers at the low end, in the middle, and \nat the high end for any good or service.101 Customers differ in their expectations for the performance of the \noffering as well as their willingness to pay. \nThe jagged lines that edge upward reflect the improvements delivered by the sustaining innovation (top line) \nand the disruptive innovation (bottom line). Incumbents are highly motivated to compete when the entrant\u2019s \noffering is within the mainstream of customer needs. Incumbents almost always succeed in fending off these \nentrants because the established firms typically have more resources than do the challengers.  \nExhibit 24: Clayton Christensen\u2019s Model of Disruptive Innovation  \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global based on Clayton M.

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n35\n \nNote that disruptive innovations are attractive initially to only those customers who are likely to be at the low end \nof the market. Those consumers are satisfied with product attributes that are relatively simple and are unwilling \nto pay much. Disruptive innovations are unappealing to mainstream consumers but good enough for part of the \npopulation.  \nThere are two main features of this model. The first is that the rate of improvement as the result of innovation, \nwhether sustaining or disruptive, is in excess of the rate the consumer demands. This means incumbents \nfollowing the trajectory of sustaining innovation will eventually have a product or service that gives the consumer \nmore than they need and costs more than they are willing to pay.  \nWhen this happens, Christensen says the incumbents have \u201covershot\u201d the market. You know a market has \novershot when customers refuse to pay for new features and fail to use many of the features that are already \navailable. Incremental ROICs for companies that compete in overshot markets migrate toward the cost of capital. \nChristensen also suggests that the basis of competition shifts from being focused on superior functionality before \nthe market is overshot to speed, customization, and convenience after the market is overshot. PCs overshot in \nthe late 1990s to early 2000s. Producers that focused on performance first lost ground to those with more \nefficient delivery models and then to substitutes such as laptops, tablets, and even smartphones. \nThis trait of steady improvement in product performance also means that disruptive innovations migrate from \nserving consumers at the low end to those in the mainstream. This is relevant because incumbents cannot \nchange their business models and are therefore positioned poorly to address competitive threats from the low \nend of the market.  \nThe case of mini-mills and integrated mills in the steel industry was one of Christensen\u2019s favorite examples. Mini-\nmills are much smaller and less capital intensive than integrated mills. The reason is that they melt scrap steel \nrather than produce steel in blast furnaces as the integrated mills do. But there is a trade-off: integrated mills \nhistorically had an advantage in producing steel of high quality because they controlled the complete process.  \nThe simpler and cheaper mini-mills started disrupting the industry in the 1970s. Initially, their inferior quality \nrelegated them to producing \u201crebar,\u201d the reinforcing bar in concrete. This product was cheap, had low profit \nmargins, and added the least value for the integrated mills. The integrated mills fled the market, and their profit \nmargins increased. You might imagine hearing the financial analysts cheering the margin expansion as the result \nof the improved sales mix. As Christensen would say, \u201cIt felt good to get in and good to get out.\u201d  \nBut it did not feel good for long. The price of rebar dropped once the integrated mills exited the market. As a \nresult, the mini-mills looked upmarket. The performance of the disruptors improved, as the theory predicts, \nallowing them to compete successfully in markets that had higher margins and added more value. This continued \nuntil the mini-mills shouldered into the high end of the market and crimped the profitability of the integrated mills.  \nThe second feature of this model is that ignoring disruptive innovations seems sensible from the point of view of \nthe incumbents. With an established and profitable business model, these companies will have little appetite to \ngo into businesses with lower margins than the current ones and to operate in insignificant and unknown \nsegments of the market. Further, an incumbent\u2019s most profitable customers do not have any interest in products \nat the low end. Firms that do what the textbooks say they should\u2014listen to their customers and practice financial \ndiscipline\u2014will have no interest in disruptive innovations. \n"

The response of the \nestablished firms is of particular significance. Incumbents are nearly always willing and able to defend against \nentrants with a new offering that is a sustaining innovation. Christensen found that the leaders at the beginning \nof a cycle of sustaining innovation \u201calmost invariably\u201d remained on top.102   \nIncumbents are motivated to flee when faced with low-end disruption, as we saw in the case of the integrated \nsteel mills. What is important is that ceding the low end of the market leads to higher profits margins for the \nincumbents in the short term. But it also allows challengers to build capabilities and resources that allow them \nto enter into the mainstream market and undercut incumbents in the long run.  \nEstablished firms are generally satisfied to ignore new-market disruptions. To see why, we return to the computer \nindustry.

Minicomputers were launched in the mid-1960s. \nCheaper than mainframes, they increased the size of the market. By the late 1970s, the leading mini \nmanufacturers had healthy pretax profit margins of 20 percent.103 Those incumbents largely ignored the PC \nindustry as it emerged because they were doing well without it. \nExhibit 25: Disruptive Innovation Categories and Characteristics \n  \nSustaining Innovation \nLow-End Disruption \nNew-Market Disruption \nCustomers \nUndershot customer \nOvershot customer at \nlow end of existing \nmarket \nNon-consumer or non-\nproducer \nTechnology \n(Product/Service/ \nProcess) \nImprovement along \nprimary basis of \ncompetition \nGood enough \nperformance at lower \nprices \nSimpler, customizable; \nallows people to \"do it \nthemselves\" \nBusiness Model \nExtension of winning \nbusiness model \nAttractive returns at \nlower prices \nCompletely new model, \ndifferent from core \nbusiness \nIncumbent Response \nMotivated to respond \nMotivated to flee \nMotivated to ignore \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global based on Clayton M.

Thomas Thurston, a venture capitalist and data scientist, \nused the theory to predict success or failure for thousands of innovations. Many businesses fail, as we saw, so \nthe goal was to predict better than what the base rates show. Thurston suggests the models are better than \nbase rates and more than twice as accurate as the predictions of the venture capital industry.104 \nIndustry dis-integration. There is a rich and deep intellectual body of work on the structure of industries and \ncompanies. This spans from the father of modern economics, Adam Smith, to a slew of economists who won \nthe Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, including George Stigler, Ronald Coase, and Oliver Williamson.105 Some \nof the important ideas include the link between specialization and market size, the importance of transaction \ncosts, and the challenges of coordination.  \nBuilding on this work, Christensen collaborated with colleagues to develop a theory that explains when industries \nare likely to migrate from being vertically to horizontally integrated.106 A company is vertically integrated if it \ncontrols most or all of the activities in its value chain, from raw materials to dealing with the customer. A value \nchain is \u201cthe sequence of activities a company performs to design, produce, sell, deliver, and support its \nproducts.\u201d107 A company is horizontally integrated when it transacts with other firms for some activities within the \nvalue chain. The theory is useful in assessing potential changes in an industry and for weighing the benefits of \noutsourcing.  \nIn mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a vertical deal is when one company acquires another that does a different \nactivity on the value chain. A transaction that seeks vertical integration can be \u201cupstream\u201d (an activity closer to \nthe raw material input) or \u201cdownstream\u201d (closer to the customer). A horizontal deal combines companies that do \nthe same activity on the value chain, often with the goal of increasing market share and scale.  \nVertical integration can be a substantial advantage as industries or products start out because coordination costs \nare high. Companies have to control all aspects of the supply chain so that the product will literally work. Exhibit \n26 shows the evolution of the computer industry. In the early 1980s, the largest computer companies were \nvertically integrated because the engineers at the firms had to make sure their complex products did what they \nwere supposed to do.  \nAs an industry grows and matures, various components within the supply chain become modules, a standardized \nor independent part of a more complex product. The process of modularization allows an industry to flip from \nvertical to horizontal. So instead of each company doing each step within the value chain, new companies pop \nup to specialize in specific activities. This occurred in the computer industry by the mid-1990s. Modularization is \na difficult engineering task, but it creates standardization and lower costs when done successfully.108  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

For example, Ford Motor Company opened its River Rouge \nfacility in the late 1920s. River Rouge included \u201core docks, steel furnaces, coke ovens, rolling mills, glass \nfurnaces, plate-glass rollers, a tire-making plant, stamping plant, engine casting plant, frame and assembly plant, \ntransmission plant, radiator plant, tool and die plant, and, at one time, even a paper mill.\u201d110 \nOver time, Ford and its competitors came to rely on suppliers and narrowed their activities on the value chain. \nToday, Ford has about 1,400 Tier 1 suppliers (companies that supply Ford with a final product) and is primarily \na vehicle assembler. The industry has become heavily horizontally integrated. This issue came to the surface \nwhen supply chain disruptions as the result of COVID-19, including with semiconductor chips, curtailed \nproduction. \nTesla is a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), a small but rapidly growing part of the global \nautomobile market. Elon Musk, the company\u2019s CEO, has said that Tesla is \u201cabsurdly vertically integrated \ncompared to other auto companies.\u201d111 This has been an advantage because it is difficult to make the vehicles \nwork well due to high coordination costs. \nNaturally, incumbent automobile manufacturers have seen Tesla\u2019s growth and want to compete in EVs as well. \nBut they ran into trouble because they tried to pry the model of modularization into a product that was not ready \nfor it. For instance, Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, explained that to build EVs the company farmed out 150 \nmodules to suppliers. Each supplier wrote unique software for their module with little coordination between them. \nTo boot, Ford struggled to integrate the modules because the individual suppliers owned the intellectual property \nof the software.  \nBranded\nPC 4\nBranded\nPC 2\nBranded\nPC 3\nBranded\nPC 1\nSales and \ndistribution\nApplication \nsoftware\nOperating \nsystem\nComputer \nassembly\nSemiconductor \nchips\nCompetitor\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSales and \ndistribution\nApplication \nsoftware\nOperating \nsystem\nComputer \nassembly\nSemiconductor \nchips\nVertical Computer Industry \n1980\nHorizontal Computer Industry \n1995\nChipco 1\nChipco 2\nOthers\nOthers\nBig OS\nLittle OS\nSpreadsheet\nWord processing Others\nRetail\nDistributors\nDirect\n"

This understanding requires assessing the strategies a firm pursues, its interaction with \ncompetitors, and how it deals with non-competitors.115 \nValue creation. Adam Brandenburger and Harborne Stuart, professors of strategy, provide a useful way to think \nabout how a firm adds value as well as overall value creation.116 Exhibit 27 summarizes the framework using a \n\u201cvalue stick,\u201d an image that another strategy professor, Felix Oberholzer-Gee, popularized.  \nThe exhibit is based on four essential concepts. The first is willingness to pay (WTP), which, as a reminder, is \nthe price a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service at which they are indifferent between the offering and \nthe cash. Next is the price the company charges its consumers for its good or service. Third is cost, or how much \na company has to spend to acquire the inputs to provide an offering. Finally, there is willingness to sell (WTS), \nan idea we also encountered already. WTS is the price at which a supplier is indifferent between withholding \ntheir product or service and cash.  \nThere is consumer surplus when the price of a good or service is below the willingness to pay (as we saw in \nexhibits 7 and 8). Willingness to pay can be difficult to measure but is determined by economic, emotional, and \nsituational drivers.117 You know that sensation when you buy something and feel like you got a good deal.  \nThere is supplier surplus when suppliers (most notably employees) receive more for their good or service than \ntheir WTS. For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s Lehman Brothers created a unique environment in \ntheir equity research department, including the ability to work from home, that allowed them to pay their analysts \n25 to 30 percent less than rivals.118  \nExhibit 27: The Value Stick Reveals Value Creation  \n \nSource: Based on Felix Oberholzer-Gee, Better, Simpler Strategy: A Value-Based Guide to Exceptional Performance \n(Boston, MA: Harvard Business Review Press, 2021), 14. \nWillingness to Pay\nPrice\nCost\nFirm \nValue \nCreation\nWillingness to Sell\nConsumer \nSurplus\nSupplier \nSurplus\n"

For example, concepts such as \u201cscale \neconomies shared\u201d and \u201ccreate more than you consume\u201d are explicit acknowledgments that sustainable value \ncreation reaches beyond the boundaries of the firm and that how the company shares value with consumers \nand suppliers is important.119 Firms can create value by increasing WTP and lowering WTS along its own value \nstick, as well as lowering WTP and increasing WTS along the value stick of its competitors. \nThe value stick also suggests that the two main ways a company can create value is to either have higher \nrelative prices or lower relative costs. (Some companies may be able to achieve both). Executives and investors \noften associate higher relative prices with a differentiation, or consumer, advantage and lower relative costs with \na cost leadership, or production, advantage. A third generic strategy, focus, entails addressing a niche market \nand may draw advantage from either the price or cost side.  \nWe will show how differentiation and cost leadership strategies show up in the composition of ROIC with some \nbasic financial statement analysis. But for now, we turn to a structured approach to understanding how a \ncompany creates value. \nValue chain analysis. Michael Porter emphasizes that strategy is distinct from aspirations, vision, or values. \nStrategy is about selecting activities in order to establish a difference from competitors that a company can \nmaintain. Activities are \u201cdiscrete economic functions or processes\u201d that lead to relative advantage with regard to \nprice and/or cost. These activities require a combination of human, intangible, and tangible capital.120  \nPorter also distinguishes between operational effectiveness and strategic positioning. Operational effectiveness \nis about sameness, and captures how well a company does the activities it has in common with its competitors. \nStrategic positioning is about difference, and defines how a firm\u2019s activities differ from those of the competition. \nPorter emphasizes that where there are differences, there are trade-offs.121  \nThe value chain is a tool that Porter developed to analyze the sequence of activities a firm selects in order to \ncompete.122 The value chain is part of what he calls the \u201cvalue system,\u201d which you can think of as the span from \nWTP to WTS on the value stick. There are nine categories of activities necessary to compete. Some of these \nrelate to primary activities, including receiving inputs, transforming them into products, and selling the output, \nand others are support activities, such as managing people and technology. Understanding how these activities \nare linked to one another is also useful. \nJoan Magretta, a strategy scholar and author, suggests four steps to draw lessons from value chain analysis:123 \n\u2022 Create a value chain for the industry. Exhibit 28 is an example for the airline industry. You can see the \nindustry\u2019s nine categories of activities. Keep in mind the profit pool analysis from exhibit 9 to get a sense \nof which activities might help or hinder economic profitability.  \n\u2022 Compare the value chain of the focal company to that of the industry. Examine the configuration of \nactivities for a particular company and see how it compares to others in the industry.

Sustainable value creation requires a \ncompany to perform activities differently or to perform different activities. This can come from any activity \nalong the value chain, from inbound logistics to service.  \n\u2022 Focus on the drivers of cost. Estimate the full costs of each activity as accurately as possible. Seek \nexisting or potential differences between the cost structure of the focal firm and that of its competitors. For \ninstance, for Southwest Airlines, the choice to use one type of aircraft lowers procurement, training, and \nmaintenance costs. Flying point-to-point leads to faster gate turnarounds and better aircraft utilization. \nAnd providing passengers with limited amenities keeps costs down. But note that these are all trade-offs: \none aircraft type limits variability for loads and routes; point-to-point is not as flexible as hub-and-spoke; \nand no frills does not appeal to all consumers. \nValue chain analysis provides an opportunity to think carefully about activities and how they can add value to \nthe firm. But it is also very important to consider how a firm can push its boundaries by increasing WTP and \nlowering WTS. \nExhibit 28: The Value Chain for the Airline Industry \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global based on Michael E.

We now return to the value stick and examine the specific ways a company can add value \n(exhibit 29). Value for the firm is the difference between price and cost. The study of industry structure through \nthe five forces tells us that the threat of substitutes, threat of entry, and bargaining power of buyers can exert \npressure to reduce price, the bargaining power of suppliers can raise cost, and rivalry among competitors can \nboth limit pricing and increase cost.  \nThe focus is how companies can either increase WTP or lower WTS. Adding value in the aggregate creates \nspace for the company to create value for itself. The primary generic strategies, differentiation and cost \nleadership, remind us that companies tend to focus on WTP or WTS.

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n44\n \nNetwork effects tend to come in one of three forms.127 Direct network effects exist when members can connect \nwith one another without having to deal with an intermediary. Telephone networks, which have been around for \nwell over a century, are the archetype.  \nFor example, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT&T) wrote this in its annual report from \n1908: \u201cA telephone\u2014without a connection at the other end of the line\u2014is not even a toy or scientific instrument. \nIt is one of the most useless things in the world. Its value depends on the connection with the other telephone\u2014\nand increases with the number of connections.\u201d128 \nIndirect network effects exist when there are complementary assets, such as razors and razor blades or hot \ndogs and hot dog buns. The WTP for a complementary asset goes up when the cost of the other goes down. \nYou are willing to pay more for hot dogs if you get the buns for free. We discuss complements in more detail \nbelow.  \nNetwork effects are also relevant for platform businesses. The feature that defines a platform is its ability to \ncreate value by enabling connections, typically between two sides of a market.129 For instance, Booking \nHoldings, a travel technology company, connects travelers with hotels, flights, car rentals, and other services. \nMore hotels on the site make it more valuable for travelers, and more travelers make it more valuable for hotels.  \nPositive feedback describes cases when the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker. This type of feedback \nis central to how valuable network effects arise. In reality, most businesses are subject to negative feedback, \nwhere the strong get weaker and the weak get stronger. The results regress toward the mean.  \nThere are often battles to decide the winner in industries where positive feedback is significant. Figuring out \nwhich technology or business will prevail in these skirmishes is rarely easy in real time.130 Enter \u201cformat war\u201d \ninto your search engine and you will see these clashes going back decades. A classic example is the British \nGauge War from the 1840s, where the Great Western Railway initially used broad gauge while competitors \nadopted narrow gauge. A government act in 1846 mandated that all new tracks be narrow gauge, effectively \nmaking that the standard gauge. \nCompanies that attain strong positions in direct, indirect, or platform businesses can enjoy network effects that \nincrease WTP.131 When that happens, the firm that controls the network has a choice about how to share that \nvalue. Keeping the price of the product or service constant increases consumer surplus, while raising the price \nallows the company to capture more of the value.  \nMany popular internet sites, including Google, Instagram, and TikTok, are available to consumers for free. But \nthey do collect lots of information about their users that they monetize through auctioning the right to advertise \nto the highest bidder. The value to advertisers rises in lockstep with the increased value to consumers. This \nbenefits the company that controls the network.  \nNetwork effects, especially through platforms, are an important driver of WTP. But they are not a free pass to \nsustainable value creation. Jonathan Knee, a professor at Columbia Business School and author, describes four \n\u201cplatform delusions.\u201d132 He argues that platforms are not new business models, digital platforms need not be \nbetter than analog ones, networks effects are not always in display with platforms, and not all platform battles \nlead to a single winner. Further, one study found that just 43 of 252 firms seeking to become successful platform \nfirms achieved their goal.133 \n"

As we have discussed, a complement is a good or service that is consumed with another good \nor service. Complements are so important that Adam Brandenburger, the same professor who co-created the \nmodel behind the value stick, teamed up with another professor of strategy, Barry Nalebuff, to write a book about \nwhat they call \u201cco-opetition.\u201d134 They note that strategy is appropriately focused on suppliers, competitors, and \ncustomers. But they argue that another group, \u201ccomplementors,\u201d can be very important in the quest for value. \nComplementors are companies that sell a good or service that complement the good or service of another firm.  \nThey created what they call \u201cthe value net,\u201d which captures not only suppliers and customers but adds \ncomplementors as well. Indeed, some professors of strategy have argued that complements should be the sixth \nforce in Porter\u2019s five forces model.135 Sometimes the same company owns complementary goods. For example, \nAmazon sells both the Kindle electronic book reader and electronic books. In other instances, complementors \nare the products of separate companies, such as cars made by General Motors and gasoline available through \nShell fueling stations.  \nFirms that can lower the cost of complements, or even give them away, shift the demand curve up for their \nproduct or service (see exhibit 8). That increases WTP.136 Amazon may sell the Kindle at cost to increase the \nWTP for electronic books. It also may explain why Alphabet, the parent of Google, bought Android, an open-\nsource mobile operating system, in 2005. Google gave Android to handset manufacturers for free and now has \nabout 70 percent of the mobile operating system market. More mobile phones using Android means more \ndevelopers to create new products to draw consumers to the platform. Ultimately, more users translate into more \nsearches on Google.137  \nIn some cases, different firms that offer complements are called \u201cfrenemies\u201d because while they acknowledge \nthat their products are more valuable together, they fight over how to divvy up that value.  \nOne example is the legal battles between Epic Games, a video game and software developer, and Apple Inc. \nand Google. Apple controls the App Store, the top marketplace for apps for the iOS mobile operating system, \nand Google controls Google Play, the top marketplace for apps for the Android mobile operating system. Epic \nmakes the popular game Fortnite, among other products. Apple and Google vet and approve the apps on their \nmarketplaces. These are complements: more video games makes the app marketplaces more useful, and more \ncustomers on the marketplaces helps sell more games. \nThe challenge is how to divide the value. For example, Apple charges a 30 percent fee for apps and in-app \npurchases, an amount Epic felt was excessive. Epic\u2019s CEO complained that Apple is \u201cpocketing a huge amount \nof profit . . . and they aren't really doing much to help us anymore.\u201d138 In response, Epic launched its own direct \npayment system in Fortnite to reduce the fees, which prompted Apple to kick the company off the platform in \nAugust 2020 for violating the store\u2019s guidelines. That resulted in a lawsuit.  \nProducts and services. Products and services that confer status, reduce search costs, consumers use by \nhabit, or have high switching costs will induce a higher WTP than other offerings in the market. \nConsumers do not buy luxury brands for functionality only but also to enhance self-esteem through social status. \nWillingness to pay for luxury brands is higher than that of equivalent products not for what they do but for what \nthey signal.139  \nAn experience good is a product or service that a consumer can assess only after he or she has tried it, such as \na restaurant, hotel, or movie. Consumers readily evaluate most offerings at the moment of purchase, including \nfurniture, appliances, and sporting goods. Many consumers say that they are willing to pay more for greater \n"

Consumers will pay more for a good or service they know and like to avoid search \ncosts, even if a better offering exists. \nBusinesses can also reduce search costs for consumers so as to increase the WTP for the goods or services \nthey offer. Video streaming and e-commerce sites use algorithms to generate recommendations. These \nalgorithms tend to improve as they are fed more data about consumer choices. Research reveals that \nrecommendations based on the tastes of participants increased their WTP.141  \nWe will discuss brands in more detail below, but for now it is important to appreciate that a brand is not valuable \nin and of itself. Proper analysis demands understanding exactly how a brand increases WTP or lowers WTS.  \nA habit is when a consumer buys a good or service automatically without thinking about it.142 Habit is sometimes \ndescribed as \u201chorizontal differentiation,\u201d a preference for an offering that is not clearly superior or inferior to other \noptions. Habitual buying varies by consumer and category but is more prevalent for frequent purchases such as \nsoft drinks, toothpaste, and pet food. For instance, consumers who buy a particular brand of soft drink by habit \nare less price sensitive than the population overall.143 \nWe have discussed switching costs as part of the assessment of supplier power, buyer power, and barriers to \nentry. Switching costs arise because a good or service creates customer lock-in, or dependence on a supplier. \nExhibit 31 shows various types of lock-in and the switching costs associated with each.  \nEarlier we defined switching costs as what buyers or users have to endure to move from one supplier to another. \nBut that is incomplete. The total switching cost is the sum of the cost to the customer and to the new supplier.144  \nThink of switching from one wireless carrier to another. You bear some costs in terms of time and trouble, but \nchances are the rival carrier is offering you a sweetener to compensate you for the effort. The new carrier\u2019s \ncustomer acquisition cost reduces your switching cost but does not change the total switching cost. This is \nimportant because the level of WTP is not just a function of consumer switching costs but also what competing \nsuppliers are willing to pay to acquire a customer.  \nExhibit 31: Types of Lock-In and Associated Switching Costs \n \nType of Lock-In \nSwitching Cost  \nBrand Loyalty \nPsychological attachment; potential dissatisfaction with new brand \nCompatibility \nNew systems may not work well with existing ones; integration costs \nContractual  \nEarly termination fees; legal costs for breaking contracts; loss of any discounts \nLoyalty Programs \nLoss of accumulated rewards; inconvenience of setting up new accounts \nData \nCosts and risks of transferring and converting data \nGeographical \nMoving costs; inconvenience of changing physical locations; loss of local benefits \nLearning Curve \nHave to learn new system; decrease in productivity initially and need for additional training \nNetwork Effects \nLess access to network members and loss of business relationships; potential smaller \nuser base on new platform \nSearch Costs \nTime, money, and effort spent learning about alternatives \nSource: Counterpoint Global and Carl Shapiro and Hal R.

Switching costs \ncan be sizeable and straightforward (e.g., switching suppliers for enterprise resource planning) or small but \ncumulatively significant (e.g., modest cost each for millions of customers to change auto insurance providers). \nPricing is useful to discuss before we leave the topic of increasing willingness to pay and consumer advantage. \nOur thinking has evolved in this area. \nLots of executives and investors focus on pricing power, a company\u2019s ability to raise prices on their offerings \nwithout losing customers or harming demand. Warren Buffett reflected this view when he said, \u201cThe single-most \nimportant decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. If you\u2019ve got the power to raise prices without losing \nbusiness to a competitor, you\u2019ve got a very good business. And if you have to have a prayer session before \nraising the price by a tenth of a cent, then you\u2019ve got a terrible business.\u201d145 \nWe believe the issue is more nuanced, especially as it relates to sustainable value creation. We agree with Felix \nOberholzer-Gee on the point that companies should focus on increasing WTP. A company that successfully \nraises WTP but does not raise its prices creates more consumer surplus. Satisfied customers are vital to a \nbusiness\u2019s health in the long term. A company that lifts WTP and needs to increase its prices has some additional \nspace to do so because it is claiming some of the consumer value it has created. The point is to focus on \nexpanding consumer surplus and then think about how to split it.  \nFirms that price near WTP risk scrutiny. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense has claimed that some \naircraft part producers have earned \u201cexcess profits.\u201d And the high prices on orphan drugs, which treat rare \ndiseases, has raised the ire of patients, payers, and policymakers.146  \nWe also know that the WTP of consumers follows a distribution, with some willing to pay more than others. This \nintroduces the prospect of dynamic pricing, where companies can adjust their prices based on changes in supply \nand demand. Dynamic pricing is perceived as unfair if it is the result of a spike in short-term demand with a lag \nin supply. An example would be stores raising prices on snow shovels following a snowstorm.147 Dynamic pricing \nis deemed more tolerable if it stimulates supply immediately, such as surge pricing for ridesharing services that \ninduces more drivers to work.148  \nConsumers are motivated to find attractive prices when companies with perishable inventory, such as airline \nflights or hotel stays, use dynamic pricing. For instance, numerous websites are dedicated to helping identify the \nlowest airfares available.  \nLowering willingness to sell reflecting a cost leadership or production advantage. The ways to increase \nwillingness to pay are relatively easy to understand, if still hard to achieve. But lowering willingness to sell is less \nintuitive. One way to think about it is from the perspective of the opportunity cost of suppliers. The main suppliers \ninclude employees, other companies, and the providers of financial capital. \nIn assessing value creation, executives and investors commonly focus on consumers and consumer surplus. \nThis makes sense. The value stick also considers supplier surplus, the difference between cost and WTS. \nCompanies that dwell on cost alone can miss the opportunity to lower WTS, which reduces cost while preserving \nor even adding value for suppliers. A company that succeeds in lowering WTS can transform its relationships \nwith suppliers from being zero-sum to win-win. Productivity in various forms is essential to managing the spread \nbetween cost and WTS. \n"

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n48\n \nWe mentioned briefly that some companies benefit from both consumer and production advantages. We will \nreturn to that point after we review some of the ways to reduce WTS:  \nLower supply cost. This can take a number of forms. One is data sharing. Most companies collect data on the \npreferences and purchase habits of their customers. Sharing this information with a supplier can make the \nsupplier more efficient and lower its WTS. For example, the sharing of information between Walmart and Procter \n& Gamble (P&G), one of its leading suppliers, led to lower inventories and higher sales for P&G.149 \nYears ago, we had a private conversation with the CEO of a division within a consumer products company that \ndid a lot of business with Walmart. Some of the company\u2019s competitors grumbled over Walmart\u2019s drive for lower \nwholesale prices, but this executive was much less concerned. His point was that the data Walmart shared \nallowed him to manage his division\u2019s balance sheet and costs more effectively.  \nHere is some simple math to show how that type of information might lower a supplier\u2019s profit margin but increase \nits ROIC. Assume the supplier, without the benefit of buyer information, earns a 10 percent profit margin (net \noperating profit after taxes \u00f7 sales) and has 1.5x invested capital turnover (sales \u00f7 invested capital) for an ROIC \nof 15 percent (10% \u2715 1.5 = 15.0%).  \nThe buyer provides high-quality data about which products are selling, regional patterns of purchase, and price \nelasticity. This information allows the supplier to better manage its costs, supply chain, and inventory. As a result, \nthe supplier\u2019s invested capital turnover rises to 2.0x. The supplier can now cut its prices by 25 percent, reducing \nits profit margin to 7.5 percent, and still earn an ROIC of 15 percent (7.5% \u2715 2.0 = 15.0%). Supplier surplus \nrises even if the seller cuts its price by only 15 percent because the lower prices and higher capital turnover lead \nto a higher ROIC.  \nProduction processes protected by trademarks, patents, licenses, operating rights, or geographic positioning \nalso lower costs. Further, there are the rare instances where one company has unique access to an input. For \ninstance, Verisk Analytics, a data analytics and risk assessment firm, maintains one of the world\u2019s largest \ndatabases of records about insurance and risk management. Dozens of its customers contribute to the data. \nThe company aggregates the data and sells predictive analytics and decision support products to its customers.  \nProductivity. Recall that operational effectiveness is how well competitors perform identical activities. Michael \nPorter argues that operational effectiveness is \u201cnecessary but not sufficient\u201d for a company to generate superior \nperformance.150 But the reality is that large differences in productivity exist across, and within, industries. For \nexample, economists found that U.S. manufacturing plants in the 90th percentile of productivity generated nearly \ntwice the output of those at the 10th percentile.151 Similarly, there are large disparities in management practices \nacross countries.  \nThe quality of management skills appears to be correlated with the national level of economic development. \nFirms with high-quality management are more productive than firms with low-quality management.152 High \nrelative operational effectiveness lowers the company\u2019s cost and WTS, as the company needs fewer inputs to \ngenerate the same output as its competitors.  \nThe learning curve, discussed earlier, can lower cost and WTS as the cost per unit declines as a function of \ncumulative experience. The benefit of learning curves comes from accumulated experience and know-how. This \nis different than economies of scale, where lower costs are the result of higher output. The learning curve and \neconomies of scale are distinct concepts but often occur at the same time.  \n"

A process to produce a good or service \nthat is simple and successful will attract competition, eventually eroding advantage. A process to create an \noffering that is complex, with demanding knowledge or coordination capabilities, can lower WTS and be a source \nof advantage. Examples include manufacturing for aircraft, nuclear energy, and rockets and spacecraft. \nAnother important source of productivity, if sometimes overlooked, is balance sheet management. Some \ncompanies can produce more cash flow using less invested capital than their competitors.153 This productivity \nwas one of the main reasons that Amazon was able to disrupt Barnes & Noble, then the largest bookseller in \nthe U.S., in the late 1990s.  \nOne significant difference between the businesses was the cash conversion cycle (CCC), an important measure \nof working capital efficiency. The CCC captures how many days a company\u2019s cash is tied up in working capital \nduring the normal course of business. The drivers of an attractive CCC include holding inventory for a short \nperiod, collecting quickly on accounts receivable, and paying suppliers slowly.154  \nIn the 1990s, these retailers received their books primarily from wholesalers. In 1999, Barnes & Noble held \ninventory for 149 days on average, collected cash in 6 days, and took 75 days to pay its suppliers (mostly the \nwholesalers). That means that the CCC was about 80 days (149 + 6 \u2212 75 = 80). Another relevant point is that \nbook retailers could return unsold books to the wholesaler, and ultimately the publisher, for a full refund.  \nAmazon\u2019s business model was totally different. They held inventory for 29 days, did not disclose their collection \ntime (2 or 3 days is a reasonable guess), and paid their suppliers in 60 days. Their CCC was about -30 days. \nFurther, they returned books to the wholesalers at a much lower rate than did the bricks-and-mortar retailers. \nThere are two important points here, both of which were knowable at the time. The first is that the wholesalers \nwere better off dealing with Amazon because they got paid faster (60 versus 75 days) and had fewer product \nreturns to deal with (traditional retailers returned between one-third and one-half of all books at that time). The \nsecond is that Amazon\u2019s negative CCC was a source of cash as long as the company was growing because it \nreceived cash for a sale before it had to pay its suppliers.  \nAmazon\u2019s productivity advantage lowered WTS because its business model required less capital and was more \nattractive to book distributors because it offered more attractive payment terms. \nCompanies also use invested capital productively when they achieve economies of scale as they have sufficient \nsales to cover their fixed costs. Fixed costs include the cost associated with fixed assets, which are not sold or \nconsumed during the normal course of business, and the cost of the labor required to run the business.  \nFor example, retailers manage distribution networks that they have built to create access for their products. Most \nscale advantages are geographically local as it is extremely hard to create national or international economies \nof scale.155  \nWalmart is a good example. The density of stores and distribution centers is one of the keys to value creation \nfor a retailer.156 When Walmart started in the early 1960s, stores and distribution centers were clustered near \nBentonville, Arkansas.157 The company\u2019s ROIC in its first couple of decades of operations was consistently \nattractive, averaging in the high teens and comfortably in excess of the cost of capital.  \nThose initial density advantages dissipated as Walmart expanded geographically, both in the U.S. and abroad, \ninto areas where other retailers were already established. As a consequence, Walmart\u2019s ROIC has trended \nlower since 1990 and is now much more similar to the cost of capital. This lesson applies to businesses that rely \n"

One illustration is an internal knowledge spillover, where \nideas from one area of a company are useful in other areas.  \nThis is a common story for big pharmaceutical companies. For example, Pfizer\u2019s research into a drug intended \nto treat hypertension showed an unexpected side effect that ultimately led to the blockbuster drug, Viagra. \nNovartis developed a drug to deal with arthritis that was useful to treat heart disease. And Merck developed a \ndrug for swollen prostate glands that led to a drug to tackle baldness.158  \nAnother example of economies of scope that more directly reflects supplier surplus is the acquisition of small \ncompanies by big companies. Large companies, relying on economies of scope, can buy small companies at a \nprice that is higher than what those businesses would be worth as standalone entities. This also helps explain \nthe decline in initial public offerings since 2000 versus the 1980s and 1990s.159 \nProductivity also shows up in the advertising cost per consumer for a good or service. For traditional advertising, \nwhen the fixed costs such as advertisement development and network costs are generally similar for all \ncompanies, large companies have an advantage over small companies in cost per potential consumer because \ntheir costs are spread over a larger base.  \nFor digital advertising, which is currently more than two-thirds of ad spending in the U.S., larger companies often \nhave more data about how their consumers use their goods and services and can therefore target their \nadvertising more efficiently. \nEmployee relations. Labor is the largest expense for most companies. This means that increasing employee \nsatisfaction is one of the most meaningful ways that a firm can increase supplier surplus. One way to do that is \nto pay employees more than what they would be willing to accept. This works if satisfied employees generate \nmore sales or incur lower costs than they would otherwise. For instance, Costco, a warehouse club retailer, pays \nits employees well above the industry average but also has employee turnover well below the average. This \ntrims hiring and training costs relative to peers.  \nPaying employees more, by itself, is not an ideal strategy because it risks creating a wealth transfer to employees \nfrom other stakeholders, which eventually weakens the business. Further, the correlation between compensation \nand employee satisfaction is weak.160 What works is creating a culture that fosters intrinsic motivation. As we \nsaw with the example of the research department at Lehman Brothers, establishing intrinsic motivation can \nsimultaneously increase employee satisfaction and lower WTS.161  \nAutonomy, mastery, and a sense of purpose are the core elements of intrinsic motivation within the workplace.162 \nAutonomy is the sense of being in control of what to do and how to act in order to achieve the firm\u2019s goals. \nMastery is the feeling of a fit between an employee\u2019s abilities and the opportunity to build skills to advance in the \norganization. Purpose is the sense that an employee\u2019s efforts help contribute to a greater good.  \nWhen assessing a firm\u2019s culture, consider whether employees are engaged, proactive, committed to delivering \nvalue for the customer, accountable, and willing to learn. Employees in companies with great cultures still want \nto be paid fairly. Paying them above their WTS can boost productivity and employee surplus.  \n"

Domino\u2019s Pizza, a pizza \nrestaurant chain, uses technology to carefully track consumer demand so that it can coordinate anticipated \nworkflows with staff schedules. This leads to fewer labor hours per unit of sales, reducing the company\u2019s cost, \nbut it also boosts employee satisfaction because workers are busy but not overwhelmed.  \nDifferentiation (consumer) and cost leadership (production) advantages. We have seen that economies of \nscale, the idea that the cost per unit declines as output rises, can arise from either the demand side, via network \neffects, or the supply side, through leveraging fixed costs. A small subset of companies enjoy scale from both \nthe demand side and the supply side. This is tantamount to pursuing a differentiation and cost leadership \nstrategy at the same time. \nAlphabet, the parent of Google, is a good case in point. The more people who use Google the more information \nthe company can collect about them. These data allow advertisers to spend their digital marketing dollars more \nefficiently. Those advertising dollars are Google\u2019s revenues, which allow the firm to improve its functionality and \nadd even more value for its users. This positive feedback is the demand side.  \nGoogle\u2019s size means it can absorb high fixed costs that competitors are challenged to match. This leveraging of \nfixed cost is the supply side. For example, it is estimated that Google paid Apple $20 billion a year to make \nGoogle the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.163 Google\u2019s market position translates into \ndemand- and supply-side scale that leads to robust profitability and scrutiny from antitrust regulators. \nBarriers to entry and the value stick. Sustainable value creation is linked to barriers to entry. But we need to \nunderstand the link between the types of barriers to entry and where they show up on the value stick. Exhibit 32 \nshows the sources of economic profit that various barriers to entry allow and where those advantages appear.  \nExhibit 32: Where Barriers to Entry Appear on the Value Stick \nSources of Economic Profit \nBarriers to Entry \nWhere It Appears on Value Stick \nAdvantage unique to incumbents, including \nproprietary technology, brands, prime locations, and \nunique access to distribution \nIncreases WTP and can lower cost \nHigh switching costs discourage users from adopting \na new offering \nIncreases WTP \nNetwork effects - value to customers increases as \nmore customers use the product \nIncreases WTP \nMinimum efficient scale is high because of large \nrequired initial investments \nCost and WTS advantage \nEconomies of scale as the result of larger volume \nCan increase WTP and lower cost and WTS \nGovernment policies or regulations \nLowers cost relative to potential entrant \nSource: Counterpoint Global and Joan Magretta, Understanding Michael Porter: The Essential Guide to Competition and \nStrategy (Boston, MA: Harvard Business Review Press, 2012), 47-50. \n \n"

Before leaving this section you should be able to answer some questions about a \ncompany: \n\u2022 Is the company\u2019s value proposition different than that of its competitors? \n\u2022 Is the firm\u2019s value chain tailored to the value proposition? \n\u2022 Can you identify the choices, or trade-offs, the company has made to make it different from its rivals? \nHow differentiation (consumer) and cost leadership (production) advantages show up in financial \nstatements. We noted that measuring the moat is not about intellectual insight. The objective is to figure out \nhow a company is doing and whether its strategy will yield long-term value creation, measured as the magnitude \nand sustainability of the spread between ROIC and WACC. \nWe can combine strategic analysis with financial statement analysis to help direct our assessment of value \ncreation. The strategic analysis guides our thinking about whether and how a company has an advantage, and \nit broadly focuses on differentiation (consumer advantage) and cost leadership (production advantage). \nFinancial statement analysis allows us to decompose ROIC into NOPAT margin and invested capital turnover. \nThis is called a DuPont analysis.164 When these terms are multiplied, the sales cancel and what is left is \nNOPAT/invested capital, or ROIC. \nThe insight is companies that enjoy attractive ROICs via a differentiation strategy tend to have high NOPAT \nmargins and satisfactory invested capital turnover. Companies that are successful because of cost leadership \ngenerally have satisfactory NOPAT margins and high invested capital turnover. The calculation of ROIC gives \nyou a sense of whether the business is creating value, and the decomposition of ROIC guides your focus toward \nunderstanding whether the source is differentiation, cost leadership, or both.  \nExhibit 33 shows the decomposition of ROIC for the top 500 companies, measured by sales, in the U.S. in 2023 \n(excludes financial and real estate companies). The NOPAT margin is on the x-axis and invested capital turnover \nis on the y-axis. For each company we show a traditional ROIC calculation (dots) as well as one adjusted for \nintangible investments (triangles).165 This adjustment typically increases NOPAT and invested capital. Including \nintangible investment does not meaningfully change the aggregate or median ROIC for the population, but it \ndoes bring extreme readings closer to the average. \nThe bottom right of the exhibit, companies with high NOPAT margins and low invested capital turnover, is where \ncompanies reside when they succeed with a differentiation strategy. The top left, companies with low NOPAT \nmargins and high invested capital turnover, features companies with a cost leadership strategy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The researchers found that \u201cbarely\u201d 12 percent of the hundreds of companies mentioned in \nthat genre met the threshold the researchers set for superior long-term results.168 \nBut they also concluded that some companies really are exceptional performers. They then asked whether those \ncompanies had any common behaviors. They did not see similarity in actions but they did observe that the \ncompanies consistently reasoned in the same way.  \nThat thought process was a strategy of differentiation. Raynor and Ahmed suggest that successful companies \noperate with two rules: better before cheaper, which means competing on differentiators other than price; and \nrevenues before cost, which means prioritizing growing sales revenue over reducing costs. In other words, focus \non the top of the value stick. \nWe also assessed whether the firms that delivered high and sustained ROICs from 1963 to 2023 relied more on \na differentiation or cost leadership strategy. We set a high bar for performance: we included only those \ncompanies that had ROICs in the top quintile for spans of ten consecutive years during the period. We found \nthat 643 firms cleared that hurdle, with some appearing more than once. We then investigated whether high \nNOPAT margin (differentiation) or high invested capital turnover (cost leadership) distinguished the companies \nfrom the rest of the sample. \nThe companies were above the average overall in margins and turnover, but the NOPAT margin made a more \nsignificant contribution. For example, the average NOPAT margin of the 30 companies that made the list in 2023 \nwas 4.4 times that of the universe, while the average invested capital turnover was 1.8 times.  \nThe goal of a thoughtful strategy is to allow a company to achieve sustainable value creation. We can measure \nvalue creation using ROIC, and a decomposition of ROIC provides vital clues as to how a company is choosing \nto compete.

But government policy can also influence corporate results in a variety of ways. \nPolicies can evolve within a country as the result of changes in political leadership, and can vary from one region \nof the world to another based on different cultural norms and laws. This variety of policy creates constant change \nin competitive circumstances for multinational corporations.169    \nHere are examples of government policies and how they can affect financial performance:  \n\u2022 Tariffs. These are taxes placed on imported goods or services. The intention is to protect domestic \nproduction by making imported products more expensive relative to domestic ones. This affects \ncompanies that use these products as inputs as well as consumers who purchase products as final goods. \nFor example, in 2024 the U.S. raised tariff rates on numerous Chinese products, including \nsemiconductors, electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, selected medical products, and some \nsteel and aluminum.170  \n\u2022 Regulations. These are rules that governments make and enforce to limit how businesses operate. \nRegulations create compliance costs for companies. These costs can also create a barrier to entry when \nincumbents influence regulations.  \nRegulation has been on the rise in the U.S. in recent decades. For example, the Regulatory Studies Center \nat George Washington University tracks \u201ccumulative economically significant final rules by administration\u201d \nand finds that the number of rules per presidential administration has risen steadily since the 1980s.171 \n\u2022 Industrial Policy. These are policies that governments use to promote or protect particular industries or \nsectors. They can also bolster national security. Industrial policy is generally implemented through \nsubsidies, tax incentives, or targeted investments that benefit the targeted areas. For example, the CHIPS \nand Science Act, passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law in 2022, provides about $280 billion \nfor domestic research and the manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. One goal is to reduce the risk \nassociated with relying on high-end semiconductor chips produced outside the U.S.172 \n\u2022 Antitrust. These include assessments and actions that promote fair competition, protect consumers, and \nprevent companies from carrying out anti-competitive practices. The challenge is determining which \ncompanies are doing well because of traditional competitive advantages versus those that are getting \nahead because of anti-competitive behavior. While there is a sense among many politicians and \neconomists that the U.S. economy is becoming less competitive, the data are equivocal.173 This means \nthat some antitrust initiatives rest as much on political views as economic realities. \nThe Biden administration in the U.S., which served from early 2021 to early 2025, stepped up antitrust \nactivity relative to prior administrations.174 Following a number of losses in the courts, the government won \na case in 2024 alleging that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s most profitable business, Google, had abused a monopoly in \nthe search business. This case will be in the courts for some time but does appear to represent a significant \nmilestone for those concerned with antitrust. \nFurther, as of 2024, the government is investigating other large technology companies, including Amazon, \nApple, and Meta Platforms, for monopolistic behavior. Applying antitrust law to technology companies is \na challenging task.175 A study of the consequences of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust \n"

This reflects a government\u2019s stance on taxation and includes tax rates as well as the size and \nforms of deductions, credits, and incentives.

There are three \nother aspects of interaction worth considering: competitive mindset, game theory, and expansion of competitive \nfrontiers. \nCompanies can fall into a mindset of business as a zero-sum game. Indications of this way of thinking include \ncompanies striving to be number one in market share, seeking to be the \u201cbest,\u201d and more of a focus on imitation \nthan innovation.177 For example, research shows that \u201ccompetitor-oriented objectives\u201d are harmful to \nprofitability.178  \nThe essence of sustainable value creation is not beating competitors but rather adopting a unique strategy. The \npursuit of attractive and persistent ROICs shifts the emphasis away from metrics such as market share and \ntoward increasing willingness to pay and reducing willingness to sell. This often means that a focus on customers \nand employees takes priority over beating competitors head-to-head. \nGame theory is one of the best ways to think about how firms interact with their competitors. It is useful because \nit compels managers to consider how their actions may trigger reactions by their competitors. Executives seek \na strategy that creates value after accounting for what other companies may do.179 The prisoner\u2019s dilemma is \nthe most famous example of two-party interaction in game theory.180 While simple, this model can be useful in \nevaluation decisions such as pricing and capacity changes.  \nConsider the case of competitors A and B in the airline industry deciding what ticket price to charge for the same \nroute (exhibit 36). We will assume the flight cost for both airlines is $160, the airlines can choose between a \n$200 and $220 fare, and that 80 percent of a sample of 10 customers will go for the lower price if it is offered.  \nIf airline A sets its price at $200 and B at $220, the figures in the bottom left corner show that A\u2019s payoff is $320 \nand B\u2019s is $120. Airline A has a profit of $40 per customer ($200 \u2212 $160) and 8 customers ($40 \u00d7 8 = $320), \nwhile Airline B has a profit of $60 per customer ($220 \u2212 $160) and 2 customers ($60 \u00d7 2 = $120). \nSimilarly, if B charges the higher price and A does not, B gets the outsized payoff (top right corner). If both go \nwith the higher price and split the customers, the total payoff is $600, the highest total possible (top left corner). \nBut if both go for the lower price, the total payoff is $400, the lowest combined amount (bottom right corner).  \nThe optimal strategy if the game is played once is to opt for the lower price. This becomes clear if you approach \nthe decision from the point of view of Airline A. The expected payoff from the lower price is higher than the \nexpected value of the higher price assuming there is an equal chance that Airline B will set its price high or low. \nThe identical thinking is operative for Airline B. The lower price gets A and B to the Nash equilibrium, the point \nwhere no competitor can gain by a unilateral change in strategy. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The chief financial officer of a company in the packaging and container industry noted \nthat the decision to build a new facility was based on economic growth but added, \u201cWhat we never seem to \nfactor in, however, is the response of our competitors. Who else is going to build a plant or machine at the same \ntime?\u201d182 \nThe point is to consider the payoffs from various actions including consideration of the potential reactions of \ncompetitors. Executives and investors can go through simple payoffs as in exhibit 36 and build a tree based on \nsequential actions. This what a chess engine does: it reviews options and settles on the one that is most \nvaluable.183 \nThe solution of our illustrative example of pricing assumed that the competitive interaction was limited to a single \noccasion. But in reality firms constantly interact with one another, so we need to analyze repeated games. This \nintroduces the possibility of a strategy that can lead to a higher payoff. \nIn 1980, Robert Axelrod, a political scientist, invited a number of game theorists to submit strategies for playing \nan iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma. The payoffs were similar to those in exhibit 36, but the strategies would compete \nover 200 rounds of the game.184 \nThe winning strategy was \u201ctit for tat.\u201d This approach begins by cooperating, equivalent to selecting the higher \nprice in our example, and then simply mimics its competitor\u2019s most recent move. For example, a firm employing \nthe strategy would lower its price in its next move if its competitor selected the lower price in its last move.  \nTit for tat starts by assuming cooperation, quickly and clearly punishes non-cooperative moves, and readily \nreverts to a cooperative stance when its competitor does. The practical challenge is reading the intentions of \nother companies. But cooperation does arise in competition, and cooperation has been essential to the success \nof humans.185 \nA\nB\n$120\n$320\nA\nB\n$320\n$120\nA\nB\n$200\n$200\nAirline B\nAirline A\n$220\n$200\n$220\n$200\nA\nB\n$300\n$300\n"

But another game, Colonel Blotto, can be \nuseful for modeling competing businesses that have asymmetric resources and options for how to allocate them. \nStrategists can apply Colonel Blotto to decisions in politics, war, sports, and business.187  \nA simple version has two dimensions: the number of soldiers and the number of battlefields. The adversaries \nallocate their soldiers across the battlefields blind to their competitor\u2019s actions. The allocations are then revealed. \nThe player with the most soldiers wins the battle, and the player who wins the most battles is victorious. Exhibit \n37 is a basic version, with players A and B each allocating 100 soldiers across 3 battlefields. The goal is to \ncreate favorable mismatches. In this case, player B wins on battlefields one and two and is therefore triumphant. \nExhibit 37: Simple Example of the Colonel Blotto Game \n \nSource: Michael J. Mauboussin, The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing \n(Boston, MA: Harvard Business Review Press, 2012), 179. \nThere are bad strategies in this basic version, such sending all the soldiers to one battlefield. But sensible \napproaches have outcomes similar to rock, paper, scissors (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper \nbeats rock), an intransitive hand game. Blotto becomes interesting when one player has more soldiers than the \nother and when the number of battlefields expands.  \nThe basic idea is that the stronger player wants to limit the number of battlefields and the weaker player wants \nto increase them. The stronger competitor is still favored when there are more battlefields, but upsets are more \nlikely.

Clay Christensen pointed out that incumbents almost \nalways win when competing where they are strong but are motivated to flee a market or ignore it altogether if \nthey do not perceive it to be an immediate threat. \nConsistent with the theme of allocating resources, the concept of \u201clinking and leveraging\u201d is also useful to \nappreciate in assessing firm interaction. Popularized by the economist W. Brian Arthur, linking and leveraging is \nwhere companies use their existing technologies or platforms (\u201clink\u201d) to expand into neighboring markets \n(\u201cleverage\u201d).188 Companies that link and leverage expand their competitive frontiers. The goal of this approach \nis to create value by building on existing strengths. But it also creates exposure to new competitors. \nThe largest and most successful technology companies today, including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, \nand Meta Platforms, maintain strong, albeit declining, market shares in their core businesses. But they are \nderiving a rising share of overall business from operations that overlap with other technology companies.189 \nLinking and leveraging has expanded their competitive frontiers. \nFor example, exhibit 38 shows the evolution of Amazon\u2019s businesses and selected competitors over the last four \ndecades. Following its launch in the mid-1990s, Amazon competed primarily with other booksellers, such as \nBarnes & Noble. But over time it expanded its scope. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a particularly revealing \ncase. The genesis of the business was Amazon\u2019s embrace of service-oriented architecture its own use. But the \ncompany realized it had developed an approach and capabilities that were valuable as an infrastructure-as-a-\nservice product for outside companies. They widely launched the first version of AWS externally beginning in \n2006.190 \nToday, Amazon competes not just in retail, but also in cloud computing, streaming services, devices, digital \nadvertising, and healthcare, among other businesses. A number of these lines were launched as complements, \nas we saw in the case of the Kindle and electronic books. But others compete in businesses where competitors \nhave strong positions.191 \nThis brief discussion of motives, interaction, and expansion add more context to the consideration of competitive \nrivalry. Competitor-focused companies that seek to compete non-cooperatively and expand rapidly into adjacent \nbusinesses are likely to face competitive challenges. By contrast, firms focused on creating value by raising \nWTP or lowering WTS and that appreciate how to generate good outcomes in a game theoretic setting and \nfocus on their competitive advantages may have a better chance at sustainable value creation.  \n"

What is important is \nassessing how and why a brand can add value. \nThere are various ways to value a brand, including measuring the cost to recreate the brand, how much of a \npremium to book value the stock market pays, and the present value of cash flows the brand generates.193 \nInterbrand, a brand consultant, publishes their list of the best global brands every year.194 Their methodology \nconsiders economic profit, how much of the purchase decision can be attributed to the brand, and a measure of \nbrand strength.195   \nExhibit 39 shows Interbrand\u2019s best 25 global brands in 2024 and the ROIC, adjusted for intangible investment, \nfor each company in 2023. The correlation between brand ranking and ROIC is weak. The sign of competitive \nadvantage is an attractive ROIC, and the companies that own these brands do not reliably indicate that.  \nYet we all have the sense that brands are relevant. The point is to take the next analytical step and identify how \nexactly a brand creates value. They contribute to value when they increase willingness to pay or reduce \nwillingness to sell. \nExhibit 39: Interbrand\u2019s Best Global Brands (2024) and ROIC minus WACC (2023) \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global and Interbrand.  \nNote: ROIC is for calendar year 2023 and adjusted for internally-generated intangible assets; ROIC=return on invested \ncapital and WACC=weighted average cost of capital. \n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nApple\nMicrosoft\nAmazon\nGoogle (Alphabet)\nSamsung\nToyota\nCoca-Cola\nMercedes-Benz\nMcDonald's\nBMW\nLouis Vuitton (LVMH)\nTesla\nCisco\nNike\nInstagram (Meta)\nDisney\nAdobe\nOracle\nIBM\nSAP\nFacebook (Meta)\nHerm\u00e9s\nChanel (Private)\nYouTube (Alphabet)\nJPMorgan\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\nROIC minus WACC (%)\nBrand Rank\nN/A\nN/A\n"

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n64\n \nThe relevance of brands varies by category and country.196 The proliferation of brands and products has made \nit increasingly difficult for brands to differentiate themselves.197 Returning to the value stick reminds us that \nincreasing willingness to pay is commonly about conferring status or creating familiarity that reduces risk for \nconsumers. \nWe can measure status by looking at the differential prices of similar goods with different brands. Hamilton \nHelmer tells the story of Good Morning America, a television program, purchasing roughly equivalent diamond \nengagement rings at Tiffany, the jewelry retailer now owned by the luxury brands company LVMH, for $16,600, \nand at Costco, the warehouse club retailer, for $6,600.  \nAn appraiser placed a value on the Tiffany ring that was $2,500 more than the Costco ring, one-quarter of the \n$10,000 price differential.198 The WTP is higher for the Tiffany ring because it confers status that the company \nhas fostered for more than a century through signals such as its robin egg blue boxes and bags. \nBrands can also reduce risk. Charlie Munger, the former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, explains it in his \ninimitable style: \u201cIf I go to some remote place, I may see Wrigley chewing gum alongside Glotz\u2019s chewing gum. \nWell, I know that Wrigley is a satisfactory product, whereas I don\u2019t know anything about Glotz\u2019s. So if one is 40\u00a2 \nand the other is 30\u00a2, am I going to take something I don\u2019t know and put it in my mouth\u2014which is a pretty personal \nplace, after all\u2014for a lousy dime?\u201d199 \nBrands can also add value by lowering WTS. For example, Walmart or Whole Foods might get a discount from \na company with a new food product seeking shelf space. The imprimatur of the retailer is valuable to the food \ncompany as it tries to expand its distribution. \nMany great companies focus intently on the consumer. But more common are firms that think about selling \nproducts that they anticipate their customer will want. Clay Christensen suggested that consumers \u201chire\u201d \nproducts or services to do a specific job. He called it \u201cjobs to be done.\u201d200 A brand that is effective at getting a \njob done creates the potential to increase WTP. \nA brand that is well known does not always create value. Brands are valuable to the degree that they allow for \nvalue creation. \n \n \n"

One essential aspect of that analysis for long-term investors is an assessment of a \ncompany\u2019s prospects for sustainable value creation. The point of measuring the moat is to develop a grounded \npoint of view on the magnitude and sustainability of a company\u2019s ROIC.  \nThe decomposition of financial results shows that while industry and management are relevant, strategy is the \nmost important determinant of long-term value creation.  \nWe start the analysis with a study of the industry to get a sense of the backdrop for competition. This investigation \nis guided by the five forces that define industry structure, with a particular emphasis on the threat of new entrants \n(thwarted by barriers to entry) and rivalry among competitors. We illustrate many of the concepts with data and \nanalysis from the U.S. airline industry.  \nA common complaint about the analysis of the five forces is that it is static. To address this, we discuss the \ntheory of disruptive innovation, which describes how strong and capable incumbents get unseated by upstarts. \nWe also review the conditions under which companies in an industry are better off being either vertically or \nhorizontally integrated.  \nWe then turn to the analysis of the firm. The value chain can be very helpful in identifying which activities a \ncompany has chosen to do differently than its peers. Trade-offs are implicit in those differences. To make the \nconcepts more concrete we review the sources of added value, including those beyond the boundaries of the \nfirm, to see how exactly companies can create value.  \nWe finish with a discussion of pricing decisions, the impact of government action, and how to think about brands. \nGenerating excess returns by investing in the stock market is difficult. But a sound and thorough analysis of \ncompetitive advantage\u2014measuring the moat\u2014can help long-term investors understand why specific companies \nare unique and capable of sustaining high ROICs. \n \n"

It\u2019s something that \ndifferentiates the company from its nearest competitors\u2014either in service or low cost or taste or some other \nperceived virtue that the product possesses in the mind of the consumer versus the next best alternative . . . \nThere are various kinds of moats. All economic moats are either widening or narrowing\u2014even though you can\u2019t \nsee it.  \nOutstanding Investor Digest, June 30, 1993 \nLook for the durability of the franchise. The most important thing to me is figuring out how big a moat there is \naround the business. What I love, of course, is a big castle and a big moat with piranhas and crocodiles.  \nLinda Grant, \u201cStriking Out at Wall Street,\u201d U.S. News & World Report, June 12, 1994 \nThe most important thing [is] trying to find a business with a wide and long-lasting moat around it . . . protecting \na terrific economic castle with an honest lord in charge of the castle.\u201d  \nBerkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, 1995 \nThe key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, \nbut rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that \nadvantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver \nrewards to investors.  \n \u201cMr. Buffett on the Stock Market,\u201d Fortune, November 22, 1999 \nWe think of every business as an economic castle. And castles are subject to marauders. And in capitalism, with \nany castle . . . you have to expect . . . that millions of people out there . . . are thinking about ways to take your \ncastle away.  \nThen the question is, \u201cWhat kind of moat do you have around that castle that protects it?\u201d  \nOutstanding Investor Digest, December 18, 2000  \nWhen our long-term competitive position improves . . . we describe the phenomenon as \u201cwidening the moat.\u201d \nAnd doing that is essential if we are to have the kind of business we want a decade or two from now. We always, \nof course, hope to earn more money in the short-term. But when short-term and long-term conflict, widening the \nmoat must take precedence.  \nBerkshire Hathaway Letter to Shareholders, 2005 \nA truly great business must have an enduring \u201cmoat\u201d that protects excellent returns on invested capital. The \ndynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business \u201ccastle\u201d that is earning \nhigh returns . . . Our criterion of \u201cenduring\u201d causes us to rule out companies in industries prone to rapid and \ncontinuous change. Though capitalism\u2019s \u201ccreative destruction\u201d is highly beneficial for society, it precludes \ninvestment certainty. A moat that must be continuously rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all . . . Additionally, \nthis criterion eliminates the business whose success depends on having a great manager. \nBerkshire Hathaway Letter to Shareholders, 2007 \nAnd we recognize that if you\u2019ve got a very good business, you\u2019re going to have plenty of competitors that are \ngoing to try and take it away from you. And then you make a judgment as to the ability of your particular company \nand product and management to ward off competitors. \n. . . If you\u2019ve got a wonderful business, even if it was a small one like See\u2019s Candy, you basically have an \neconomic castle. And in capitalism, people are going to try and take away that castle from you. \nSo, you want a moat around it, protecting it in various ways that can protect it. And then you want a knight in the \ncastle that\u2019s pretty darn good at warding off marauders. But there are going to be marauders. And they\u2019ll never \ngo away. \nBerkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, 2017 \n"

The \ngoal is to provide context for executives or investors studying an industry or a specific company. \nROIC. Exhibits 40 to 44 show trends on return on invested capital (ROIC) for public U.S. companies from 1963 \nto 2023. The analysis includes companies that have been listed on the major U.S. stock exchanges: the New \nYork Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and NYSE American. We exclude American depositary receipts (ADRs) \nbecause they reflect foreign companies and companies in the finance sector for accounting reasons. \nFor 1963-1996, our data is from Compustat and reflects fiscal years, and for 1997-2023, our data is from FactSet \nFundamentals and reflects calendar years. The choice of using fiscal or calendar years should have limited \nimpact, as we estimate that more than three-fourths of companies align their fiscal years with the calendar year.  \nWe calculate the ROICs using both a traditional approach and with an adjustment for internally-generated \nintangible assets. This modification recognizes the rise of intangible investments that companies expense on \nthe income statement. Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) and invested capital typically increase as a result \nof this adjustment, but free cash flow is unaffected.201 \nExhibit 40 shows ROIC by industry from 1963 to 2023. There are a couple of important takeaways. First, the \nvariance within industries is greater than the variance across industries. This underscores that the industry is \nimportant but does not dictate a firm\u2019s destiny. All industries have companies that create and destroy value. \nThe second takeaway is that adjusting ROIC for intangibles tends to pull the very high and very low ROICs \ntoward the middle. The median and average ROICs are similar for both the traditional and adjusted calculations, \nbut the distribution has less variance following the modifications. \nExhibit 40: ROICs by Industry, Traditional and Adjusted, for U.S. Companies, 1963-2023 \n \n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nPersonal Care Products\nTobacco\nHousehold Products\nProfessional Services\nPharmaceuticals\nAir Freight & Logistics\nTech Hrdwre Strge & Prphrls\nAir Freight & Logistics\nDiversified Consumer Services\nDiversified Consumer Services\nTextiles & Apparel & Luxury Goods\nElectrical Equipment\nHealth Care Equip & Supplies\nBuilding Products\nSemis & Semi Equipment\nLife Sciences Tools & Services\nIT Services\nTextiles, Apparel, Luxury Goods\nFood Products\nElctrnc Eqp Instmnts & Cmpnts\nCons Staples Dstrbn & Retail\nTrading Companies & Distributors\nCommercial Services & Supplies\nBuilding Products\nChemicals\nMachinery\nCommunications Equipment\nSpecialty Retail\nAutomobile Components\nAerospace & Defense\nContainers & Packaging\nBroadline Retail\nHousehold Durables\nMedia\nHotels Restaurants & Leisure\nHealth Care Prvdrs & Svcs\nHealth Care Equipment & Supplies\nDistributors\nInternet & Catalog Retail\nEntertainment\nConstruction & Engineering\nGround Transportation\nAutomobiles\nConstruction Materials\nPaper & Forest Products\nOil Gas & Consumable Fuels\nEnergy Equipment & Services\nTransportation Infrastructure\nBiotechnology\nMetals & Mining\nElectric Utilities\nGas Utilities\nPassenger Airlines\nMarine Transportation\nDiversified Telecomm Services\nMulti-Utilities\nHealth Care Technology\nWater Utilities\nWireless Telecom Services\nIndep Pwr & Rnwble Elect Prdcrs\nROIC (Percent)\nTraditional\nMedian\n80th Percentile\n20th Percentile\n"

A markup describes a price above marginal cost (as depicted in exhibit 8).202 There has been concern \namong some economists and policy makers that markups have risen sharply in recent decades, an indication \nof rising market power.203 One method economists use to estimate markups is to look at the relationship between \nsales (output) and cost of goods sold (input).204 \nBelow we show trends with markups for public U.S. companies from 1963 to 2023. Like our analysis of ROIC, \nthis is based on the companies that have been listed on the major U.S. stock exchanges and it excludes ADRs \nand finance companies. The main difference here is we use Compustat data (based on fiscal years) for the \nentire period to maintain a consistent treatment of COGS.205 \nIn addition, to limit the effect of extreme outliers, we set a minimum level for some accounting items and trim the \ndata. Specifically, we require minimum sales, COGS, SG&A, and R&D of 0.1 million in 2023 USD and remove \ncompanies that have unadjusted markups in the 1st and 99th percentiles. We calculate an aggregate markup by \nweighting companies based on sales. \nExhibit 45 shows aggregate markups for U.S. companies without any adjustment for intangible investments.

Early phases include lots of experimentation \nin an attempt to provide a product or service that the market wants. These product innovations come from new \ncompanies entering the industry seeking a toehold to build on.  \nThe market eventually gravitates toward the products that meet the needs of the industry. Companies pursing \ntacks the market has dismissed then exit the industry, either by shutting down or selling themselves. This pattern \nof boom and bust is called the product life cycle.

After an industry is born, the common pattern is for the number of entrants to rise and then fall. The total \nnumber of competitors is small at the end of the process.210 \n2. Industry output grows even as the number of producers falls from the peak. This means that fewer \ncompanies share a larger market. \n3. The market shares of the competitors are initially volatile but eventually stabilize.211 \n4. The diversity of versions of competing products is related to the growth of entrants. The number of \ninnovations peaks in the growth phase and falls thereafter. \n5. Product innovation is the focus early in the cycle. Process innovation is the focus late in the cycle. \n6. Most product innovations come from new entrants when the number of entrants is on the upswing.  \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n1885\n1889\n1893\n1897\n1901\n1905\n1909\n1913\n1917\n1921\n1925\n1929\n1933\n1937\n1941\nNumber of Companies\nAutomobiles\nEntries\nTotal\nExits\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\nNumber of Companies\nPersonal Computers\nEntries\nTotal\nExits\n"

All rights reserved. \n3927037 Exp. 10/31/2025 \n76\n \nKlepper and Michael Gort, an economist, looked at how these regularities applied to almost four dozen \nindustries. They found that the regularities, including the growth in net entry in the early stages, low to zero net \nentry near the peak of competition, and negative net entry late in the cycle, helped explain the development of \nnearly all of the industries.212  \nJames Utterback, an emeritus professor of management at MIT, describes three phases of this recurring pattern \nin his book, Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation.213 The first is what he calls the \u201cfluid\u201d phase, where \ncompanies experiment with product design and tinker with potential business models. The emphasis is on the \nperformance of the various competing products, and which technology will emerge as a winner is unclear. \nEntrepreneurs tend to lead these companies.  \nSecond is the \u201ctransitional\u201d phase. This occurs after the market selects a product design. Companies shift their \nemphasis from product to process innovation. Complementary assets are also important because new \ncompanies are also part of a business ecosystem. For example, automobiles need roads, parking lots, gas or \ncharging stations, and mechanics. \nFinally, there is the \u201cspecific\u201d phase where the pace of product and process innovation is slow. Most competitors \nhave high operational effectiveness as best practices have diffused throughout the industry. Companies here \nmay be susceptible to disruptive innovation, where new business models, a form of process innovation, allow \nentrants to compete for specific segments of the market.214 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
