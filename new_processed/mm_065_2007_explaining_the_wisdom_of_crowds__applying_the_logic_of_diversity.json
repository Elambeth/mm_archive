While enthusiasts 2 and \ndetractors 3 have made their case, much of the marshaled evidence is anecdotal. Even when the idea\u2019s \nsupporters specify the necessary conditions for the wisdom of crowds to succeed, there is rarely \ndiscussion of how it works. In an approving 2006 New York Times article, columnist Joe Nocera \nexplained collective accuracy by plucking a Hollywood movie line: \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery.\u201d 4 \n \nFortunately, Scott Page\u2019s important new book, The Difference, introduces some much-needed rigor \ninto why collectives do well and why they fail, why experts are often inferior to the crowd, and why \ndiversity is important. Page not only carefully defines his terms, he also uses mathematical models to \ndevelop and apply theorems. These theorems illustrate the logic of diversity, removing a good deal of \nmystery from the wisdom of crowds. \n \nIn this discussion, we apply Page\u2019s models to three types of problems and provide real-world \nexamples and data for a pair of them. Before moving into the analysis, three points bear emphasis: \nthe importance of recognizing the problem type, the conditions under which the wisdom of crowds \nworks, and why these ideas are so important for investors and decision makers. \n \nProblem Type: Expert or Crowd? \n \nFirst, understanding the type of problem you face is a crucial step in figuring out how to best solve it. \nFor example, while companies often talk about the value of diversity within an organization, diversity \nis of no help\u2014and indeed may be a hindrance\u2014in solving many problems. If your plumbing is in need \nof repair, you\u2019ll be better off with a plumber than an English lit major, a Peace Corps volunteer, and \nan astrophysicist working together. Diversity typically becomes more important when the problem is \ncomplex and specifiable rules cannot solve it. \n \nWe address three distinct problems. The first is what we call a needle-in-the-haystack problem. Here, \nsome people in the crowd know the answer while many, if not most, don\u2019t. The second is a state \nestimation problem, where one person knows the answer but the group does not. Finally, there is a \nprediction problem, where the answer has yet to be revealed.      \n \nEach problem type has a distinct set of issues, and the discussion of the wisdom of crowds often \nincorrectly conflates the problem types. So matching the problem type with the best means to solve \nthe problem is a crucial, and almost always overlooked, step. 5          \n \nConditions for the Crowd to Be Wise \n \nEven if you determine a collective is the best means to solve a problem, certain conditions must \nprevail for the crowd to be smart. These include diversity, aggregation, and incentives.  \n \nYou can think of diversity as cognitive differences. Page unpacks diversity into four frameworks: 6 \n \n\u2022 \nPerspectives: ways of representing situations and problems \n\u2022 \nInterpretations: ways of categorizing or partitioning perspectives \n\u2022 \nHeuristics: ways of generating solutions to problems \n\u2022 \nPredictive Models: ways of inferring cause and effect \n \nMore often than not, when organizations discuss diversity, they refer to social identity diversity\u2014\ngender, race, religion, age, etc. There\u2019s good reason to believe social identity diversity correlates with \ncognitive diversity, but they are certainly not the same. The ultimate goal is cognitive diversity. 7 \n \nAggregation means there\u2019s a way to bring the group\u2019s information together. Stock exchanges are a \ngood example of aggregation mechanisms, as are polls and voting. Diversity without aggregation \nresults in unused problem-solving potential.8 \n \n"

      "text": " \nPage 3 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nThe final condition is incentives. The basic idea is you are rewarded for being right and penalized for \nbeing wrong. The payoffs can be monetary, as they are in markets, but they need not be. Payoffs can \nbe measured with reputation, or even fitness (an ability to survive and propagate).  \n \nIncentives serve to grease the skids of collective accuracy in a couple of ways. 9 The first, which is \nvery relevant for markets, is self selection. Active money managers tend to buy or sell when they \nbelieve they have an investment edge. This serves to improve predictive accuracy. 10  \n \nThe second way relates to rewards\u2014your payoff is higher if your bet is away from the crowd. Just as \na horse race handicapper makes more money by correctly anticipating a win by a long shot than by a \nfavorite, so too investors earn higher returns by making non-consensus bets. This encourages \ngreater diversity. \n \nWhy Should I Care?     \n \nThis discussion of problem types, diversity, and collectives may seem far afield from what investors \nthink and talk about from day to day. Are these concepts relevant for someone trying to generate \nexcess returns? Our answer is an unmitigated yes, for lots of reasons. \n \nTo begin, the wisdom of crowds appears to be a viable and robust way to explain market behavior. At \na high level, market efficiency prevails when the wisdom of crowds conditions are in place. Said \ndifferently, the market yields prices the economic textbooks predict without the constrictive \nassumptions associated with most economic models. 11 When the conditions are violated, markets \ncan and will periodically veer from efficiency, accommodating inefficiencies, and even booms and \ncrashes. This approach specifies the conditions under which markets will be efficient or inefficient.   \n \nThis discussion also allows for a deeper understanding of how to solve problems\u2014especially \ncomplex problems. It also highlights pitfalls that decision makers commonly fall into, especially in \ncommittee settings or in the process of deliberation. So these ideas may not only lead to better \ndecisions but also to fewer decision-making failures. \n \nFinally, these ideas have tremendous implications for organizations\u2014from whom to hire, to how to \ncreate teams, to when to leverage collective wisdom. Managers can shed superficial ideas about \ndiversity and think proactively about how to leverage diversity\u2019s value.  \n \nProblem One: Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \n \nNow let\u2019s turn to our problems. The first is a needle-in-a-haystack problem, where there is an answer, \nand some members of the crowd know what it is. It\u2019s like playing Trivial Pursuit with a huge group: \nsome people are likely to know the answer to a particular question, and it will be different people for \ndifferent questions. Diversity\u2019s value is easy to see in this context. What\u2019s remarkable is it doesn\u2019t \ntake many people knowing the answer\u2014or even having a better than random chance to guess the \nright answer\u2014for the correct answer to emerge. \n \nJim Surowiecki presents a neat example of this problem based on the TV show Who Wants to Be a \nMillionaire? 12 In the show, a contestant is asked a series of consecutively difficult multiple-choice \nquestions, with a payoff of $1 million for getting them all right. The producers added spice to the show \nby allowing baffled contestants to choose one of three options to help answer a question: eliminate \ntwo of the four possible answers (offering the contestant a fifty-fifty chance), call a predetermined \n\u201cexpert\u201d for counsel, or poll the studio audience.  \n \nWhen called on, the experts provided the right answer a respectable two-thirds of the time. More \nsurprising was that the audience\u2014a group of folks with nothing better to do on a weekday \nafternoon\u2014returned the correct answer over 90 percent of the time. The crowd smoked the expert. \n \nHow can we explain this result? Law professor Cass Sunstein offers one possibility based on the \nCondorcet Jury Theorem. 13 In its simplest form, the Condorcet Jury Theorem holds that if an average \ngroup member has better than a 50 percent chance of knowing the right answer and the answer is \n"

It turns out we don\u2019t need assumptions anywhere near as strong as those \nin the theorem to show why the crowd is smart in this instance.  \n \nTo illustrate the point, we borrow Page\u2019s example from The Difference. 14 He hypothetically presents \nthis question to a crowd: \n \nWhich person from the following list was not a member of the Monkees (a 1960s pop band)? \n \n(A) Peter Tork \n(B) Davy Jones \n(C) Roger Noll \n(D) Michael Nesmith \n \nThe non-Monkee is Roger Noll, a Stanford economist. Now imagine a crowd of 100 people with \nknowledge distributed as follows: \n \n\u2022 \n7 know all 3 of the Monkees \n\u2022 \n10 know 2 of the Monkees \n\u2022 \n15 know 1 of the Monkees \n\u2022 \n68 have no clue \n \nIn other words, less than 10 percent of the crowd knows the answer, and over two-thirds are culturally \ndeprived of any Monkees knowledge. We assume individuals without the answer vote randomly. The \nCondorcet Jury Theorem, then, doesn\u2019t apply because only a small minority knows the answer.  \n \nIn this case, the crowd will have no problem fingering Noll as the non-Monkee. Here\u2019s the breakdown:  \n \n\u2022 \nThe 7 who know all the Monkees vote for Noll;  \n\u2022 \n5 of the 10 who know 2 of the Monkees will vote for Noll; \n\u2022 \n5 of the 15 who know 1 of the Monkees will vote for Noll; and  \n\u2022 \n17 of the 68 clueless will vote for Noll.  \n \nSo Noll will garner 34 votes, versus 22 votes for each of the other choices. The crowd easily identifies \nthe non-Monkee. In plain words, random errors cancel out and the correct answer rises to the \nsurface. We could add even more clueless people without violating the result: while the percentage \nmargin by which Noll wins would decline, he would be the selection nonetheless.  \n \nNow if it were this easy, the crowd would always get 100 percent instead of 90 percent. Two variables \nare key: the percentage of the crowd who know the answer and the degree of randomness in the \nanswers. Of the two, randomness is more important than accuracy: a surprisingly small percentage of \nthe population can know the answer and the group will be right with high randomness. Deviations \nfrom randomness will create less-than-perfect crowd answers, albeit still very good ones.  \n \nThis type of collective problem solving is not limited to humans. Biologists have shown similar \nmechanisms guide decision making among certain animals, notably schooling fish and bee hives. \nThe scientists observe that large groups require a small proportion of informed individuals to guide \nthe group, and that only a very small proportion of the group needs to be informed for the group as a \nwhole to achieve great accuracy. That this decision-making approach has stood evolution\u2019s test \nunderscores its robustness. 15   \n \nIn the real world problems like this do exist, but collective voting is rarely used to solve them. \nHowever, technology has made this type of problem solving much easier. Search engines, which use \nrankings based on the wisdom of crowds, answer most routine questions like the identities of the \nMonkees very quickly and effectively. 16  \n"

Here, only one person knows the \nanswer and none of the problem solvers do. A classic example of this problem is asking a group to \nguess the number of jelly beans in a jar. We have been doing this experiment for over a decade at \nColumbia Business School, and the collective answer has proven remarkably accurate in most trials.  \n \nTo explain why the jelly bean experiment works, we turn to one of the central ideas in Page\u2019s book, \nwhat he calls the diversity prediction theorem. 17 The theorem states:  \n \nCollective error = average individual error \u2013 prediction diversity \n \nThe mathematical foundation for the theorem is the use of squared errors as a measure of accuracy. \nResearchers in the social sciences and statistics frequently use squared errors, which have the \nbenefit of avoiding negative and positive errors cancelling out. 18 \n \nAverage individual error combines the squared errors of all of the participants. In plain language, it \ncaptures the average accuracy of the individual guesses. \n \nPrediction diversity combines the squared difference between the individuals and the average guess. \nSimply, it reflects the dispersion of guesses, or how different they are.  \n \nThe collective error, of course, is simply the difference between the correct answer and the average \nguess. Page treats the diversity prediction theorem in depth in his book, and includes numerous \nexamples. \n \nThe diversity prediction theorem has some crucial implications. The first is a diverse crowd will always \npredict more accurately than the average individual. So the crowd predicts better than the people in it. \nNot sometimes. Always. \n \nSecond, collective predictive ability is equal parts accuracy and diversity. 19 You can reduce collective \nerror by either increasing accuracy by a unit or by increasing diversity by a unit. Both are essential. \n \nFinally, while not a formal implication of the theorem, it is true that the collective is often better than \neven the best of the individuals. So a diverse collective always beats the average individual, and \nfrequently beats everyone. And the individuals who do beat the collective generally change, \nsuggesting they are more of a statistical vestige than super-smart people.  \n \nBecause the theorem is based on math\u2014and pretty basic math at that\u2014it\u2019s always true. Still, the \ntheorem\u2019s implications are not necessarily intuitive. That the crowd is better than we are is not a \ncomforting thought. \n \nOur 2007 jelly bean results illustrate the point. The average guess of the class was 1,151 while the \nactual number of beans was 1,116, a 3.1 percent error. Of the 73 estimates, only two were better \nthan the average. Appendix A provides more detail on the diversity prediction theorem and its \napplication to the jelly bean experiment we conducted this year. There\u2019s nothing unique about 2007; \nthe results are the same year after year.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Our example here is another experiment with the Columbia Business School students. \n \nHere\u2019s what we do. A few weeks prior to the Academy Awards ceremony, we distribute a two-sided \nform. On the front page are the six most popular Academy Awards categories: \n \nBest actor \nBest actress \nBest supporting actor \nBest supporting actress \nBest film \nBest director \n \nOn the back are six less visible categories: \n \nBest adapted screenplay \nBest cinematography \nBest film editing \nBest music (original score) \nBest documentary \nBest art direction \n \nWe ask the students to contribute $1 to a pot (with the winner getting the proceeds\u2014incentive) and to \nselect independently who they believe will win each category. The goal is to win the pot, not to reveal \nsentimental favorites.  \n \nThe 2007 results show the diversity prediction theorem at work. The consensus, defined as the modal \nselection in each category, got 11 of 12 correct, including all 6 on the back page. Two students tied \nfor the most correct answers, each getting 9 of 12 correct, and the average student got just 5 of 12 \nright. \n \nWhile we can\u2019t tie the collective error back directly to the 11 of 12 accuracy because of the multiple \nselections per category, the diversity prediction theorem illustrates how accuracy and diversity \ncombine to produce a crowd-beating answer. In Appendix B, we provide details of the student \nguesses and show how the collective error does link precisely to the answer for each category. \n \nThis problem is almost like a combination of the first two. Like the Monkees example, some people \nprobably have better predictive models than others (i.e., they know their pop culture), hence allowing \nthe most likely answer to rise to the surface. The answer emerges as we combine a lot of diversity \nwith a little predictive accuracy. \n \nWhile the logic of diversity certainly provides some important insights and useful models, we by no \nmeans fully understand the wisdom of crowds. For example, while it is clear the collective will do \nbetter than the average individual, it\u2019s not clear why the collective is often so accurate. But these \nmodels and examples provide a concrete step in the right direction, and allow us to dismiss other \nexplanations like the Condorcet Jury Theorem and the square-root law. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Here are some thoughts: \n \n\u2022 \nWisdom of crowds and market efficiency. A number of leading finance academics, \nincluding William Sharpe, Richard Roll, and Jack Treynor, have pointed to the wisdom of \ncrowds as a plausible explanation for market efficiency. 20 We are enthusiastic advocates \nfor this view as well. 21 The value of this approach is it reveals the conditions under which \nmarkets are likely to be efficient or inefficient.  \n \n\u2022 \nThe importance of cognitive diversity. If correct, this approach underscores the major role \nof cognitive diversity. Diversity can be beneficial on an organizational (company, club, \nschool) or an individual level. Empirical research shows that cognitively-diverse \nindividuals outperform cognitively-focused individuals. 22 Conversely, homogenous \ninvestor behavior\u2014a well-studied topic in social psychology and sociology\u2014can lead to \ndiversity breakdowns and a large collective error. 23  \n \n\u2022 \nThere are no answers in markets. Except in cases of mergers or acquisitions, there are \nno objectively correct answers in the stock market. So it\u2019s impossible to apply the \ndiversity prediction theorem directly to the market. However, the theorem is of great value \neven if it offers some insight into the market\u2019s mechanism, including a well-placed \nemphasis on accuracy and diversity.  \n \n\u2022 \nRisk. While there is clearly a long-term relationship between risk and reward, the \nmarket\u2019s perception of risk vacillates. Introducing diversity may provide an important \ndimension of risk that currently lies outside the traditional mean-variance framework. \nFurther, diversity reductions have a non-linear impact on the systems they operate within, \nadding to the analytical challenge. 24   \n \n\u2022 \nBehavioral finance.  General equilibrium models, the foundation for the mean-variance \nframework, assume agent rationality. Over the past few decades, behavioral finance has \nemerged as a research area that weds psychology and economics. Researchers have \nfound that individuals often behave in suboptimal, albeit often predictable, ways. This \nassault on rationality is a challenge to classic theory. However, provided suboptimal \nbehavior leads to diversity, markets can still be collectively smart even as investors are \nindividually suboptimal. This condition is only violated if nearly all investors act in unison, \nwhich happens infrequently. \n \n\u2022 \nDivergence of opinion as a proxy for diversity?  One potentially fruitful line of research \nlinks the dispersion of analyst forecasts (a proxy for differences of opinion) with \nsubsequent stock returns. The research shows stocks with greater dispersion have lower \nsubsequent returns because only the most optimistic investors, those who by definition \nplace a high value on the company, trade the stock, and more pessimistic investors do \nnot trade (the model assumes supply is finite). Stated differently, diversity is clipped, \nleading to greater collective error in the form of overpricing. 25  \n \n\u2022 \nHumility. The logic of diversity shows that in solving hard problems, the crowd is almost \nalways going to be better than most people if diversity, aggregation, and incentives are \noperative. Investors aware of this reality will remain humble, while seeking occasions \nwhen the crowd\u2019s wisdom gives way to whim, and hence opportunity.  \n   \n"

      "text": " \nPage 10 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nThe Ox-Weighing Contest \n \nJim Surowiecki opens The Wisdom of Crowds with the story of Francis Galton and an ox-weighing \ncontest. Over a century ago, Galton observed an ox-weighing contest at a county fair, where nearly \n800 participants paid a sixpenny fee to guess the ox\u2019s weight in the hope of winning a prize for the \nbest guess.  \n \nAs Surowiecki relates, Galton found the average guess to be 1,197 pounds, nearly identical to the \nox\u2019s actual weight of 1,198 pounds. What\u2019s more, Galton provided a subset of the guess data, \nallowing us to apply the diversity prediction theorem. \n \nWhile the ox problem is very similar to the jelly bean problem in approach and result (and even the \nabsolute amounts\u20141,198 pounds for the ox and 1,116 jelly beans\u2014are similar), the diversity \nprediction theorem shows the nature of the crowds were vastly different. Recall: \n \nCollective error = average individual error \u2013 prediction diversity \n \nConsider the two equations together: \n \nJelly bean jar contest: \n1,258 = 490,949 \u2013 489,692 \n \nOx-weighing contest: \n0.62 = 2,956.05 \u2013 2,955.43 \n \nWhat\u2019s intriguing is both the average individual error and prediction diversity were much lower in the \nox-weighing contest. Perhaps part of the difference is sample size, as the jelly bean experiment had \nroughly one-tenth the sample size of the ox-weighing experiment. Another explanation is the people \nwho participated in the ox-weighing contest had a better sense of the ox\u2019s weight, many of them \nbeing farmers or butchers. \n \n \n \nCOLUMN A \nCOLUMN B \nCOLUMN C \nCOLUMN D \nCOLUMN E \nBuckets \nGuess \n\"Difference \nFrom Actual\" \nSquared \n\"Difference \nFrom \nActual\" \n\"Difference \nFrom \nAverage\" \nSquared \n\"Difference \nFrom \nAverage\" \n1 \n1,074 \n-124 \n15,376 \n-123.21 \n15,180.95 \n2 \n1,109 \n-89 \n7,921 \n-88.21 \n7,781.18 \n3 \n1,126 \n-72 \n5,184 \n-71.21 \n5,071.01 \n4 \n1,148 \n-50 \n2,500 \n-49.21 \n2,421.72 \n5 \n1,162 \n-36 \n1,296 \n-35.21 \n1,239.81 \n6 \n1,174 \n-24 \n576 \n-23.21 \n538.75 \n7 \n1,181 \n-17 \n289 \n-16.21 \n262.80 \n8 \n1,188 \n-10 \n100 \n-9.21 \n84.84 \n9 \n1,197 \n-1 \n1 \n-0.21 \n0.04 \n10 \n1,207 \n9 \n81 \n9.79 \n95.82 \n11 \n1,214 \n16 \n256 \n16.79 \n281.87 \n12 \n1,219 \n21 \n441 \n21.79 \n474.76 \n13 \n1,225 \n27 \n729 \n27.79 \n772.23 \n14 \n1,230 \n32 \n1,024 \n32.79 \n1,075.12 \n15 \n1,236 \n38 \n1,444 \n38.79 \n1,504.59 \n16 \n1,243 \n45 \n2,025 \n45.79 \n2,096.63 \n17 \n1,254 \n56 \n3,136 \n56.79 \n3,224.99 \n18 \n1,267 \n69 \n4,761 \n69.79 \n4,870.50 \n19 \n1,293 \n95 \n9,025 \n95.79 \n9,175.53 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage \n1,197.21 \n \n2,956.05 \n \n2,955.43 \n \nSource: Francis Galton, \u201cVox Populi,\u201d Nature, 75, March 7, 1907.  \n \n\"Actual\" weight of ox\n1,198\n\"Average Guess\" of weight of ox\n1,197.211\nAverage Individual Error\n2,956.05\n(Average of Column C)\nPrediction Diversity\n2,955.43\n(Average of Column E)\nCollective Error\n(\"Average of Column A\"-\"Actual\")^2\n.623\nCHECKS:\nCollective Error = Average Individual Error - Prediction Diversity\n.623   =   2,956.053   -   2,955.429\n\u221aCollective Error = ABS [\"Average Guess\"  -  \"Actual\"]\n\u221a.623  =   ABS [1,197.211   -   1,198]   \u2248   .789\n"

      "text": " \nPage 11 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nAppendix B: The Academy Awards Experiment \n \nIn early February 2007, the students were asked to participate in an experiment to predict the winners \nin 12 categories of the Academy Awards. They received a form with six well-known categories on the \nfront, and six less-known categories on the back. The assumption is predictive models are generally \nmore robust for the first six categories, which the data support. The students were asked to contribute \n$1 to a communal pot, with the student(s) with the most correct choices winning the pot. The small \ncontribution and possibility of winning a larger sum add some incentive to answer as well as possible. \n  \nForms in hand, we determined the modal selection for each category, which we call the group \nanswer. For example, for the lead actor category 48 percent of the participants (26 of 54) selected \nForest Whitaker, the eventual winner. The modal selection was as low as 26 percent (14 of 54) for \nbest music and as high as 65 percent (35 of 54) for best documentary. A purely random distribution \nwould allocate 20 percent of the votes to each nominee.  \n \nWe can think of the student votes as expressing a probability of each nominee winning. Accordingly, \na better way to look at the performance is to express the selections as subjective probabilities, and to \ncompare actual outcomes to the subjective estimates over a large sample. No single year offers us \nsufficient data to do that. \n  \nThe 2007 results strongly support the diversity prediction theorem. The collective correctly selected in \n11 of the 12 categories. The best students (number 3 and 5) got 9 of the 12 categories right and split \nthe pot of money. The average student was correct in 5 of the 12 categories. We have seen similar \nresults consistently over the years.  \n  \nTwo of the categories are particularly interesting. For the supporting actor category, 30 percent of the \nclass (the consensus) selected Djimon Hounsou, while 26 percent of the vote went to Alan Arkin (the \neventual winner) and another 26 percent to Eddie Murphy. So while the class got this category wrong, \nit's easy to see that three nominees were very close. Best music had a similar dynamic: Babel (the \nconsensus and winner) gathered 26 percent of the votes, but two other nominees, Pan's Labyrinth \nand The Queen, each received 22 percent of the vote. So while the consensus was right here, it was \nalso close to a one-in-three chance.  \n  \nThis problem appears to be a combination of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and the jelly bean jar. \nSome students are likely to have better predictive models than others, and hence the likely winner will \nrise to the surface. But since it's a prediction\u2014essentially estimating a future state\u2014the problem has \nfeatures similar to the jelly bean jar problem.      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

We consider independence as a subset of \ndiversity. If diversity prevails, so will independence, although the inverse is not true. Independence is \na necessary but not sufficient condition for diversity. \n8 Surowiecki has a good discussion of aggregation in the context of the U.S. intelligence effort. See \nSurowiecki, 66-69. \n9 Page, 233-234. \n10 The strength of this argument is weakened by agency costs in the investment industry. For a good \nsurvey, see Alfred Rappaport, \u201cThe Economics of Short-Term Performance Obsession,\u201d Financial \nAnalysts Journal, Vol. 61,3, May/June 2005, 65-79. \n11 This view is expressed by Nobel-winning economist William Sharpe. He says, \u201cThe basic argument \n[of The Wisdom of Crowds] is that if we have enough people even though they may be ill-informed \nand irrational coming to market, it is entirely possible the prices of assets, thereby true risks and \nrewards, are what you would get if they were all rational and well informed.\u201d See Ayse Ferliel, \n\u201cInterview with William Sharpe,\u201d Investment Adviser, December 6, 2004.   \n12 Surowiecki, 3-4. \n13 Sunstein, 25-32. \n14 Page, 183-185. \n15 Iain D. Couzin, Jens Krause, Nigel R. Franks, and Simon A. Levin, \u201cEffective Leadership and \nDecision-Making in Animal Groups on the Move,\u201d Nature, February 3, 2005; Thomas A. Seeley, P. \nKirk Visscher, and Kevin M.

If their errors are wholly independent, the standard error in equilibrium price declines \nwith roughly the square root of the number of investors.\u201d We believe the square-root law, which says \nthe standard error of the mean decreases with the square root of N (number of observations), is an \ninappropriate explanation for the jelly bean (or market efficiency) problem. The square-root law \napplies to sampling theory, where there are independent observations that include the answer plus a \nrandom noise term. Over a large number of observations, the errors cancel out. An example is \nobserving and measuring star luminosity. The underlying assumption behind the square-root law is \nthe observations are independent and identically distributed around a mean. This is clearly not the \ncase with either the jelly bean jar or markets. We believe the diversity prediction theorem is a more \nrobust way to explain the wisdom of crowds in this case. See Jack L. Treynor, \u201cMarket Efficiency and \nthe Bean Jar Experiment,\u201d Financial Analysts Journal, May-June 1987, 50-53.  \n19 For another discussion of the usefulness of diversity in forecasting, see J.
