Some are \nspecific to the company, such as the cash flows that result from \nsales growth, operating profit margins, and investments. Others \nare external, including economic growth, inflation, and the cost of \ncapital. In the short term, these factors combine with swings in \ninvestor sentiment to determine stock prices. In the long term, the \nresults of the business carry the day. \nTSR is the capital accumulation rate that investors earn if they \nreinvest all of their dividends into more shares of the stock during \ntheir holding period.2 This report examines the sources of TSR \nand ties them to underlying economic principles. The goal is to \ncreate a bridge between theory and practice. The concepts are \nrelevant for helping to assess the prospective returns of the stock \nof any company. We emphasize value traps, stocks of companies \nthat appear to have an inexpensive valuation but have drivers \nconsistent with outcomes below the average.  \nThe analysis reveals that few investors in the stocks of companies \nthat pay dividends earned the TSR. It also dispenses with the \ncommon but incorrect perception that dividends contribute to \ncapital accumulation.  \nThis framework gives investors a checklist of drivers and the tools \nto help assess them. It also provides a way to decompose past \nreturns to see what drove the results. We start with the calculation \nof TSR. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n6031029 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n2\n \n \nCalculating Total Shareholder Return (TSR) \nThe equity rate of return for a stock over one year is simply the change in stock price from the beginning of the \nyear to the end of the year plus any dividends the company paid. For instance, if a stock price appreciated 8 \npercent and the company paid a dividend with a yield of 2 percent, the equity rate of return was 10 percent.  \nThe calculation of total shareholder return for a stock or index is slightly different than the equity rate of return \nbecause the TSR assumes shareholders reinvest their dividends in additional shares. The formula for TSR is as \nfollows: \nTSR = price appreciation + [(1 + price appreciation) \u00d7 dividend yield] \nFor example, if price appreciation is 8 percent and the dividend yield is 2 percent, the TSR is 10.16 percent \n(.1016 = .08 + [(1.08) \u00d7 .02]).3 This is the capital accumulation rate. Only investors who reinvest all their dividends \ninto the stock with no taxes or transaction costs can earn the TSR.  \nInvestors as a group cannot earn the TSR even if a small number of investors do because reinvesting dividends \nin additional shares requires sellers to match the buyers.4 If all shareholders are buyers, there are no sellers. \nThose who sell cannot earn the TSR. \nWe can break down the formula for TSR even further. Price appreciation over a period reflects earnings per \nshare (EPS) growth combined with the change in the price-earnings (P/E) multiple. Price appreciation exceeds \nEPS growth when the P/E multiple expands and falls short of EPS growth when the multiple contracts.    \nEPS growth integrates the change in net income and the change in shares outstanding. Net income growth can \ndiffer from operating profit growth as a result of changes in financing costs and tax rates. The change in shares \noutstanding reflects the net effect of equity issuance and buybacks over the relevant period.   \nDividends reflect the capacity and proclivity of the company to return capital to shareholders. About one-third of \npublic companies in the U.S. pay a dividend. Companies also use share buybacks to return cash to shareholders. \nBuybacks reduce the shares outstanding.  \nAn investor\u2019s ability to earn the TSR requires full dividend reinvestment in additional shares. A very small \npercentage of investors are willing or able to earn the TSR. Indeed, investors commonly consider price changes \nand dividends to be separate rather than related components in total returns.5 \nExhibit 1 summarizes the drivers of TSR as well as the fundamental sources behind them. We explore each of \nthese drivers and provide a framework and data for thinking about how they might change over time.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6031029 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n3\n \n \nExhibit 1: Drivers of Total Shareholder Return \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global.  \nThe TSR formula is straightforward but further examination of the term on the far right, (1 + price appreciation) \n\u00d7 dividend yield, reveals that price appreciation is the only source of investment return that contributes to capital \naccumulation.    \nTo see why, we have to slow down the process of a payout and consider two scenarios. Assume a shareholder \nowns 100 shares of a $200 stock ($20,000 = 100 \u00d7 $200) and the company declares a dividend of $4.  \nIn the first scenario, the investor simply takes the dividend in cash. She will be left with 100 shares of a stock at \nits ex-dividend price of $196 ($19,600 = 100 \u00d7 $196) and $400 in cash.6 The sum of the stock holding and the \ndividend is $20,000 ($20,000 = $19,600 + $400).  \nResearch suggests that most individual investors use dividends for current consumption.7 This is an example of \nmental accounting: the stock holding is in one account for investment and the dividend is in another account for \nconsumption.8 Academics call this the \u201cfree dividends fallacy\u201d because such accounting seems to neglect the \nfact that the dividend payment reduces the stock price.9  \nIn the second scenario, the investor reinvests the dividend into additional shares of the stock. That allows for \nthe purchase of an additional 2.0408 shares ($400/$196) and the shareholder is again left with $20,000 ($20,000 \n= 102.0408 \u00d7 $196). The investor has exposure to price appreciation only because all of the proceeds from the \ndividend are reinvested into the stock. Investors who seek capital accumulation, and therefore focus on TSR, \nderive no returns from dividends.  \nExhibit 2 shows the TSR for the S&P 500, an index that tracks the results of the stocks of the 500 largest \ncompanies listed in the U.S., on an annualized basis from 2012 through 2021. We select the 10 years ended \n2021 so that we could use forward P/E multiples. The annual TSR over that period was 16.6 percent.  \nWe can see how the drivers contribute to the total. Net income growth was 6.7 percent and the reduction in \nshares outstanding was 0.7 percent, leading to EPS growth of 7.4 percent. The P/E multiple expanded during \nthis period, adding 6.9 percentage points. The combination of EPS growth and multiple expansion led to price \nappreciation of 14.3 percent. \nTotal \nshareholder \nreturn\nDriver\nSub-driver\nSub-driver\nPrice appreciation\nDividend\nP/E multiple change\nDividend reinvestment\nEarnings per \nshare growth\nNet income growth\nChange in shares \noutstanding\nSales growth, operating \nprofit margin, financing \ncosts, tax rate\nEquity issuance \nor retirement\nValue creation \nprospects, risk\nCapacity to return \ncapital, capital \nallocation policy\nReinvestment \nprogram, tax rate, \nother frictions\nFundamental source\n"

The sum of 14.3 percent from price appreciation and 2.3 percent from dividends and dividend \nreinvestment is 16.6 percent. \nThe right column in exhibit 2 shows the percentage contributions of each of the drivers. Earnings per share \ngrowth was 44 percent, multiple expansion 42 percent, and dividends and dividend reinvestment 14 percent. \nWe now examine the components of total shareholder return: net income growth, change in shares outstanding, \nchange in P/E multiple, the ability to pay a dividend, and dividend reinvestment. We seek to connect these \nconcepts to frameworks for assessing them and, where relevant, base rates of relevant results.  \nLinking the Drivers: From Theory to Practice \nNet income growth. Net income equals earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT, or operating profit) minus net \ninterest expense and taxes. Accordingly, assessing net income requires a separate understanding of operating \nprofit growth, net interest expense, and the tax rate. \nA deep discussion of operating profit growth is beyond the scope of this discussion, but there are a few important \nconcepts to consider. The first is gaining a realistic sense of the total addressable market (TAM). You should \nthink of TAM not as the aggregate of a market but rather as the portion of the market that a company can serve \nwhile creating value.10  \nThe size of the market is the number of potential customers multiplied by the average revenue per customer. A \nconvenient example is an estimate of the market for a new medicine.11 A thoughtful estimate requires judging \nthe population of possible users, the subset of the population likely to use the good or service, and the sales \nthat result. \nA company\u2019s cost structure determines the operating profit margin, or operating profit divided by sales.

Operating leverage, the change in operating profit as a function of change in sales, is also crucial. \nBusinesses with high fixed cost structures tend to have substantial operating leverage. \nDebt and equity financing both have an opportunity cost. This cost is equivalent to the expected return for capital \nproviders. But the cost of debt is explicit whereas the cost of equity is implicit.  \nThe cost of debt shows up on the income statement as interest expense. Exhibit 3 shows the cost of debt for \nBBB U.S. corporate bonds from August 2008 through 2022. BBB is the lowest rating that qualifies as investment \ngrade. The cost, or expected return, starts with the real yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and then adds \ninflation expectations and the credit spread. The credit spread is the return bondholders demand over the \nTreasury note to compensate them for risk. Of the global bonds rated by S&P Global, a leading credit rating firm, \na little more than three-quarters are investment grade and BBB is the most common rating.12 \nExhibit 3: Expected Returns on BBB U.S. Corporate Bonds Calculated Monthly, 2008-2022 \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran; FRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Counterpoint Global. \nNote: August 2008-December 2022; Treasury note=10-year U.S. Treasury note; BBB spread=ICE BofA BBB U.S. corporate \nindex option-adjusted spread. \nInterest rates and corporate bond yields drifted lower during the period we measured to calculate the TSR for \nthe S&P 500. Further, many companies held cash that created interest income, and the debt-to-total capital ratio \ndeclined modestly for public companies in the U.S.13 The net result is that the pretax margin, which is after net \ninterest expense but before taxes, rose for the aggregate of companies in the S&P 500 over the decade we \nsampled.  \nPretax income minus taxes gets us to net income. Net income margins also expanded because the tax rate \ndipped.

Over the period we measured, interest \nand tax expense as percent of operating income went from roughly 32 to 24 percent. In fact, interest expense \nand taxes as a percentage of operating profit have declined steadily since 1980, which has allowed net income \nto grow faster than operating profit over that time.14  \nOne method to assess the future is to consider the problem you face as an instance of a larger reference class. \nThe results from the reference class are called base rates. These allow you to examine what happened to others \nwho were in a similar situation before.  \nIn this case, we can ask what base rates tell us about net income growth. We examined the correlation, r, \nbetween past and future 1-, 3-, and 5-year net income growth from 2012 to 2022. Our sample excludes any \ncompany that had negative net income over a measured period. Just under 30 percent of public companies had \nnegative net income over the span we examined. Our sample includes more than 1,250 companies. \nA correlation of zero means there is no persistence. A correlation of 1.0 means the second outcome is perfectly \nrelated to the first. A negative correlation means the latter outcome is anti-persistent relative to the early one. In \nother words, outcomes with bad expected values are more likely to follow good outcomes, and outcomes with \ngood expected values are more likely to follow bad ones.  \nExhibit 5 shows that the correlation in net income growth is -0.10 for 1 year, -0.20 for 3 years, and -0.28 for 5 \nyears. This is consistent with the academic literature that shows low persistence in net income growth.15 These \nresults show that extrapolating past net income growth into the future is rarely a good idea. \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n1947\n1950\n1953\n1956\n1959\n1962\n1965\n1968\n1971\n1974\n1977\n1980\n1983\n1986\n1989\n1992\n1995\n1998\n2001\n2004\n2007\n2010\n2013\n2016\n2019\n2022\nPercent\nEffective tax rate\nTop federal \nstatutory tax rate\n"

This occurs when investments generate net income growth but fail to earn the cost of \ncapital.16 The negative impact these investments have on value show up as a lower P/E multiple rather than in \nnet income growth.  \nMergers and acquisitions are a good example. It is common for companies to pronounce that an acquisition \nadds to EPS at the same time its stock declines. A shrinking P/E multiple allows for earnings to be up and the \nstock to be down.  \nChange in shares outstanding. Earnings per share equal net income divided by shares outstanding. When a \nprofitable company\u2019s shares outstanding rise, EPS growth is less than net income growth. When shares \noutstanding fall, EPS increases faster than net income. For companies with negative net income, more shares \noutstanding dampen the loss per share and fewer shares outstanding exacerbate the loss per share. \nCompanies issue shares for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) financed with stock, for stock-based compensation \n(SBC), and in equity offerings. Companies retire shares primarily through share buybacks. Since 2000, public \ncompanies in the U.S. have issued less equity than they have retired. \nExhibit 6 shows the annual equity issuance for U.S. public companies from 2000-2022. We include SBC only \nsince 2006, the first year the Financial Accounting Standards Board required companies to disclose SBC on the \nincome statement.

M&A financed with equity can add or detract \nfrom earnings per share based solely on the difference in the P/E between the buyer and seller.  \nA deal always adds to the buyer\u2019s EPS when its P/E is higher than that of the seller. This is called the \u201cbootstrap \neffect\u201d because EPS rise even if there are no financial benefits to putting the businesses together and the value \nof the firms do not change after the combination.17 Conversely, EPS always fall when the buyer\u2019s P/E is lower \nthan that of the seller.  \nThat means that a high P/E company buying a low P/E company is good for EPS but the exact same transaction, \nlow buying high, is bad for EPS. The conclusion is that the change in EPS alone tells you nothing about the \nvirtue of a deal. \nInvestors should assess the price appreciation potential of M&A deals financed with stock based on the \neconomic merits rather than the impact on EPS. The simplest way to determine the value creation potential for \nthe buyers is to estimate the present value of synergies minus the premium paid. \nSBC has risen from $29 billion in 2006, or 0.2 percent of sales, to $296 billion in 2022, equivalent to 1.3 percent \nof sales. SBC as a percentage of sales tends to be higher in general for smaller, young companies than for \nlarger, old companies. By using SBC instead of cash, companies can provide employees with compensation \nupside if the stock does well and can reduce the need to raise equity in a secondary offering. \nCompanies announcing secondary offerings generally increase investments in capital expenditures and \nresearch and development. Yet, their stocks tend to go down upon announcement.18 This is consistent with the \nidea that firms issue equity when they deem the price to be full and retire it when they perceive it to be \nundervalued.19    \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\n2022\nProceeds ($ Billions)\nSeasoned Equity Offerings\nStock-Based Compensation\nMergers & Acquisitions\n"

Share buybacks decrease shares outstanding \nand increase the stake of ongoing holders. To generalize, small companies tend to issue equity and hence dilute \nongoing holders, while large companies generally reduce shares outstanding through buybacks.   \nExhibit 7 shows the shareholder dilution for companies in the Russell 3000, ranked in size by decile from 2020 \nto 2022. The Russell 3000 tracks the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. public companies. The companies \nin the smallest three deciles realized average dilution of six percent, while the largest three deciles collectively \nretired equity. \nExhibit 7: Three-Year Dilution of Shareholders by Decile for the Russell 3000, 2020-2022 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global.  \nNote: Data for calendar year 2022; Minimum sales of $100 million. \nShare buybacks are a way to return capital to shareholders that are equivalent to dividends under strict \nassumptions.20 But unlike dividends, which treat all shareholders equally, buybacks that occur at any price other \nthan fair value result in a wealth transfer. A company that buys back undervalued stock transfers wealth from \nthe selling shareholders to the ongoing holders. And companies that repurchase overvalued stock transfer \nwealth from the ongoing shareholders to the selling shareholders. \nThe decisions to retire stock through buybacks and issue stock via SBC are distinct but many executives link \nthem. Specifically, they seek to buy back shares to offset the dilution from their SBC programs. For instance, 68 \npercent of chief financial officers who were surveyed said that \u201coffsetting the dilutionary effect\u201d of SBC was \n\u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important.\u201d21 Another study of large U.S. public companies found that 37 percent of the sum \nspent on buybacks in recent years \u201chad the effect of reversing the share dilution\u201d from SBC programs.22 \nExhibit 8 shows the cumulative percentage change in shares outstanding for the S&P 500 in total, as well as its \nconstituent sectors, from 2011 through 2021.

Shares outstanding rose almost 45 percent for the real estate \nsector but fell about 25 percent for information technology. Understanding equity issuance or retirement can \nprovide insight into the relationship between net income and EPS growth.   \nIn theory, corporate executives should invest only in opportunities where the present value of the future cash \nflows is expected to exceed the cost. They are supposed to try to maximize this net present value. In reality, \nhowever, it appears many executives focus more on maximizing EPS.23  \nFor example, a survey of chief financial officers (CFOs) found that they perceived EPS to be the key metric in \nfinancial reporting. As one CFO said, \u201cearnings are in a class by themselves.\u201d24 Consistent with this attitude, \nmore than three in four CFOs said that increasing EPS was an important, or very important, factor in the decision \nto buy back stock.25  \nThere is no evidence that increasing EPS through buybacks creates shareholder value.26 Change in EPS and \nvalue creation are separate concepts and an increase in EPS should not be used as a proxy for value creation.27  \nIndeed, the presumption that buybacks always increase EPS is wrong. The common portrayal is that net income \nis divided by fewer shares and therefore automatically leads to a boost in EPS. This simplistic analysis neglects \nthe fact that the company has to fund the buyback, either with excess cash or additional debt. Excess cash \ngenerates interest income, and debt comes with interest expense. As a result, buybacks affect net income as \nwell as shares outstanding. \n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nCumulative Change (Percent)\nCommunication Services\nReal Estate\nUtilities\nMaterials\nEnergy\nConsumer Discretionary\nHealth Care\nConsumer Staples\nIndustrials\nFinancials\nInformation Technology\nS&P 500\n"

When the earnings \nyield is higher than the after-tax rate, buybacks lift EPS.28 Research shows that when the cost of debt is low \ncompanies are more likely to issue debt and buy back stock.29 \nHere are some numbers to show how the math for buybacks funded with debt has changed in recent years. In \nJuly 2020, the after-tax yield on BBB debt, assuming a tax rate of 20 percent, was under 2 percent. This means \nthat a buyback of a stock with an E/P of 2 or more, equivalent to a P/E of 50 or less, would add to EPS. The \nS&P 500\u2019s P/E at that time was around 25.  \nIn the beginning of October 2023, the after-tax yield on BBB debt was 4.9 percent, which means that only \nbuybacks of stocks with an E/P of 4.9 or more, or a P/E multiple of 20.4 or less, are accretive to EPS. This was \nlower than the P/E multiple for the S&P 500 overall at that time.  \nIssuing or retiring shares can be positive, neutral, or negative for ongoing shareholders. In the aggregate, \ncompanies that have high net issuance of new shares provide lower TSRs than those that retire shares.30 Using \nchanges in EPS to measure the impact of decisions regarding equity is suboptimal. But it appears to be what \nmany companies do in practice and what lots of investors consider. The focus should be on economic value, \nwhich seeks to assess whether the benefit of future cash flows exceeds the cost of issuing equity.   \nChange in the P/E Multiple. The P/E multiple, or any other multiple, is a shorthand for the process of valuation. \nThe value of a financial asset equals the cash flows the asset will generate discounted to the present at an \nappropriate rate. Within the P/E, \u201cprice\u201d reflects a stream of cash flows for many years into the future while \n\u201cearnings\u201d are commonly a snapshot of past, current, or imminent earnings. When a P/E multiple is justifiably \nhigh, the price captures many years of future results while the earnings consider outcomes only in the near term.    \nWhile our focus is on P/E multiples, the ideas we discuss are relevant to other multiples, including price/sales \n(P/S) and enterprise value (EV) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).31 \nWhen surveyed, 93 percent of investment professionals reported that they use multiples. P/E, P/S, and \nEV/EBITDA are among the most popular multiples they use.32 \nCash flows and the discount rate are the main aspects of the P/E multiple. Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani, \na pair of economists who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, published a paper in 1961 that provides \na fundamental way to think about the cash flows.33 \nThe idea is that you can think of the value of a business as having two parts: a steady-state value and the \npresent value of growth opportunities (PVGO). The steady-state value assumes that the company can sustain \nits current earnings into the future. The PVGO reflects the magnitude and sustainability of future investments \nthat earn a positive spread between return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC).34   \nWe can start by assuming that the PVGO is zero and that all of a company\u2019s value comes from the steady state. \nIn this case, we assume that a company maintains its current earnings in perpetuity. The value of a perpetuity \nis earnings \u00f7 cost of equity and the steady-state P/E is 1 \u00f7 cost of equity. For instance, if earnings are $100 and \nthe cost of equity is 8 percent, the value of the perpetuity is $1,250 ($1,250 = $100 \u00f7 .08) and the P/E is 12.5 \n(12.5 = 1 \u00f7 .08). \n"

The essential \nconcept is that the cost of equity is a measure of opportunity cost. That means market conditions are an important \ndeterminant of the P/E multiple.  \nA company\u2019s WACC reflects the blend of equity and debt it uses to finance its business and the cost of each. \nUnlike the cost of debt, which is explicit, we must estimate the cost of equity. One approach is to start with a \nrisk-free rate of return, where the yield on the 10-year Treasury note is a standard proxy, and add an equity risk \npremium (ERP). This is the additional return that equity investors demand in order to own an asset riskier than \nthe Treasury note.  \nAswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at New York University and an expert in valuation, shares his \nestimate of the ERP each month along with the assumptions he uses to derive the figure. Damodaran\u2019s estimate \nrequires forecasts for drivers such as cash flow growth and return on capital. We have found a good fit between \nhis estimate of the cost of equity and subsequent 10-year TSRs for the S&P 500. \nExhibit 9 traces the steady-state P/E for the S&P 500 from 1963 to the end of the third quarter of 2023 using \nDamodaran\u2019s figures.

For example, \nconsumer staples companies have faded at a rate slower than energy companies in the past. A firm\u2019s ability to \nsustain high ROICs is an indication of competitive advantage.39 \nA company can offset a lower spread between ROIC and WACC by investing more. We can see why through \nthe concept of economic profit, which equals the ROIC \u2013 WACC spread times invested capital. For instance, a \ncompany with an ROIC of 15 percent, a WACC of 10 percent, and invested capital of $1,000 generates economic \nprofit of $50 ($50 = [.15 \u2013 .10] \u00d7 $1,000).  \nBut a company with an ROIC of 12 percent, the same WACC, and invested capital of $3,000 creates economic \nprofit of $60 ($60 = [.12 \u2013 .10] \u00d7 $3,000). In practice, it is challenging to invest substantial sums while still earning \nsufficient returns on investment.  \nThe final determinant of the PVGO is the competitive advantage period. Academic research finds that the \nmarket-implied CAP was around eight years from 1975 to 2015. CAPs change for businesses over time and \nlong market-implied CAPs tend to be consistent with poor subsequent stock price results. This underscores the \nchallenge in sustaining a high value for the PVGO.40 \nThe important implication of this discussion is that P/Es for high multiple companies have the tendency to migrate \ntoward the commodity P/E over time.41 The reason is that the spread between ROIC and WACC narrows on \nnew investments making the PVGO a lower percent of the total value. This does not happen to every company, \nand some companies actually improve their ROICs. But understanding incremental ROIC is essential in \nassessing the change in multiple.  \nWe see regression toward the mean for P/E multiples in exhibit 12. We sort the universe by quintile, based on \ndeviation from the median P/E in the universe, starting in 2012. The difference between the highest and lowest \nquintiles begins at 17.3 percentage points and ends in 2022 at 12.5 percentage points. As with ROICs, P/E \nmultiples do not always go down.

The starting point is the steady-state \nP/E, which is determined by market forces such as the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium. Next is an \nassessment of the PVGO, a measure of future value creation. This component is driven by the spread between \nROIC and WACC, as well as the magnitude of investment and how long a company can find attractive \nopportunities.  \nROICs, P/E multiples, and P/S multiples regress toward the mean. But that does not mean that some companies \ncannot sustain, or even improve, their high ROICs or P/E and P/S ratios. Analysis of the corporate life cycle, \nwith stages from introduction to growth to maturity and decline, shows that firms frequently transition between \nstages.42  \nThe Ability to Pay a Dividend. Free cash flow (FCF), or net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus \ninvestments in future growth, is the foundation of corporate value. FCF is the cash that is available for distribution \nto the debtors and shareholders of the business. Debt capacity tends to increase as companies grow their \noperating profits. As a result, companies in the aggregate issue debt and retire equity. That means that firms \ncommonly use FCF to pay dividends or buy back stock. Total shareholder yield, dividends plus net buybacks \ndivided by equity market value, is a useful measure of value.43   \nNote that 40 percent of companies that disclose free cash flow in earnings announcements define it as cash \nflow from operations minus capital expenditures, items disclosed on the statement of cash flows.44 Many \ninvestors use this definition as well. This can vary meaningfully from the proper definition within finance, \nespecially in cases when SBC is a large percentage of cash flow from operations. \nA company needs positive free cash flow to pay dividends or buy back stock unless it chooses to borrow or use \nexcess cash. But there is nothing wrong with negative FCF, which occurs when investments exceed NOPAT, if \nthe return on investment is above the cost of capital. In this case negative FCF is good because it leads to more \npositive FCF in the future, making the firm more valuable. \nAlfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, \ncreated a formula to determine what he called the \u201caffordable dividend rate.\u201d It is more accurate to call it the \naffordable payout ratio. The formula relies on FCF, as well debt capacity through a target debt-to-total capital \nratio, to determine the percentage of net income a company can pay out to shareholders in the form of dividends \nor buybacks.45  \nThe actual payout ratio for the S&P 500 from 2012 to 2021 was about 90 percent. Rappaport\u2019s formula for the \naffordable payout ratio provides a nearly identical percentage. The utility of the formula comes from its close link \nto free cash flow.   \nDividend reinvestment. The calculation of TSR assumes all dividends are reinvested in the stock at no cost. \nAs noted, research shows that individual investors largely consider price appreciation and dividends to be \ndifferent and commonly consume rather than reinvest dividends. Studies of institutional investors show that the \nholdings of stocks that pay dividends rarely change after the dividend distribution date, a clear indication that \ndividends are not reinvested in the payer\u2019s stock.  \nThen there is the issue of taxes. Shareholders who receive dividends in taxable accounts cannot reinvest all of \nthe proceeds into the stock because they have to pay taxes. This reduces the contribution of dividend \n"

The tax rates on dividends and capital gains in the U.S. have been the \nsame since 2003, but prior to that the tax rate for dividends was consistently higher than that for capital gains.  \nOur example with the S&P 500 showed that dividend reinvestment accounted for about 14 percent of the \naccumulated capital. The percentage of accumulated capital attributable to reinvested dividends grows as the \nholding period lengthens.   \nSince price appreciation is the only source of investment return that contributes to capital accumulation, \nreinvesting dividends in a stock that realizes a declining price compounds the loss. Some academics have \nconcluded that TSRs are understated because investors in fact reinvest dividends into other investments.46 This \nunderscores the point that few investors actually earn the TSR despite its widespread use.  \nValue Traps. Investors create the opportunity for excess returns by buying a financial asset when expectations \nare low and selling it when they are higher. One proxy for low expectations is a P/E multiple that is less than a \nstock\u2019s historical average or that of the stock market overall. This may appear to be a good value.  \nBut such investments provide disappointing results in many cases. A value trap is a stock that trades at a multiple \nbelow the average only to earn a total shareholder return, adjusted for risk, that is below the average. \nPerhaps the best way to understand a value trap is to review a case study. This analysis examines history to \nmake a point, and past performance is no guarantee of future results. We selected AT&T from 2012-2021. To \nstart, the company had a P/E below, and a dividend yield above, that of the S&P 500.  \nExhibit 14 shows that AT&T\u2019s annual TSR was 3.7 percent versus 16.6 percent for the S&P 500. The shares of \nAT&T were less volatile than the market but still underperformed after adjusting for risk. The company made two \nlarge acquisitions during this period, including buying DirecTV for $49 billion in 2014 and Time Warner for $109 \nbillion in 2016. \nExhibit 14: Drivers of Total Shareholder Return for AT&T, 2012-2021 Annualized \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global.  \nTotal \nshareholder \nreturn\n3.7%\nDriver\nSub-driver\nSub-driver\nPrice appreciation\n-2.0%\nDividend\n5.8%\nP/E multiple change\n-3.9%\nDividend reinvestment\n-0.1%\nEarnings per \nshare growth\n1.9%\nNet income growth\n4.0%\nChange in shares \noutstanding\n-2.1%\n108.7%\n-58.1%\n-106.1%\n158.7%\n-3.2%\n100.0%\nPercent of Total\n"

Further, AT&T\u2019s shares outstanding increased about 2 percent per year versus an \naverage annual decrease for the aggregate of companies in the S&P 500. As a result, AT&T\u2019s EPS growth was \n1.9 percent, about one-quarter of the 7.4 percent growth that the constituents of the S&P 500 achieved. \nThe compression of AT&T\u2019s P/E multiple reduced the stock\u2019s TSR by 3.9 percentage points, the largest negative \ncontributor to the TSR. This occurred in spite of the fact that the starting P/E was below that of the market. Over \nthe same period, the P/E multiple of the S&P 500 expanded, adding 6.9 percentage points to the market\u2019s TSR.  \nExhibit 15 shows AT&T\u2019s ROIC, adjusted for intangible investment, from 2003 to 2022. While volatile, the general \ntrend is down, including large drops following the big M&A deals. Over the measured period, the PVGO went \nfrom positive to less than zero.

However, the poor price appreciation was offset by dividend payments that \nprovided a yield well above that of the S&P 500. The contribution from the yield was 5.8 percent and the \nreinvestment was -0.1 percent. Because the price appreciation was only slightly negative, the impact of dividend \nreinvestment was of minor importance.  \nThis discussion reiterates the important takeaway that price appreciation is the only source of return that \ndetermines capital accumulation. This is because the TSR assumes investors use their dividend to buy more \nshares of stock.  \nAt the end of the report, we provide a checklist to guide the analysis of the components of TSR.

All rights reserved. \n6031029 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n19\n \n \nConclusion \nTotal shareholder return (TSR) is the capital accumulation rate for investors who reinvest dividends at no cost. \nTSR is a popular return measure despite the fact few investors earn it for the stocks of companies that pay a \ndividend. Investors fail to earn the TSR because they do not reinvest the dividend or cannot reinvest the full \namount because of taxes or other costs. Price appreciation and the capital accumulation rate are the same for \nthe stocks of companies that do not pay a dividend, which includes about 65 percent of U.S. public companies.      \nWe can break down TSR into drivers, including net income growth, change in shares outstanding, P/E multiple \nchange, and the benefit of reinvesting dividends. We examine each of these drivers and link them to underlying \neconomic principles. \nIt is useful to think about the value of a business in two parts: a steady-state value and the prospects for future \nvalue creation. The steady-state value assumes that the company can sustain its current earnings forever. \nFuture value creation reflects the ability to earn a return on invested capital in excess of the cost of capital, the \namount of investment the company can make while maintaining a positive spread, and the length of time a \ncompany can create value with its investments. Historically, about two-thirds of the value of the S&P 500 has \nderived from the steady-state value.  \nThe market determines the appropriate P/E to apply to current earnings through an estimate of the cost of equity \ncapital. The cost of equity is the opportunity cost of equity investors and is commonly estimated by adding an \nequity risk premium to the risk-free rate. Over the past 60 years, the steady-state P/E has gone from a low of \n5.1 in 1981 to a high of 17.7 in 2020. \nThe multiples of companies with high P/Es tend to regress toward the steady-state P/E over time because the \nrelative contribution of future value creation shrinks. This reflects market saturation and competition. Some \ncompanies can defy this downward drift by either sustaining a high return or by investing in new businesses.  \nInvestors often consider dividends to be part of total returns. But for investors using TSR, price appreciation is \nthe only source of investment return that contributes to accumulated capital. Indeed, dividends and share \nbuybacks have the same result in a TSR calculation because they both increase the percentage ownership in a \ncompany. In the case of dividends, the investor uses the proceeds to buy more shares at the ex-dividend price. \nIn the case of buybacks, the investor does not sell and hence winds up with a higher percentage of the company. \nThese are equivalent, save for the reality that dividend reinvestment generally has a cost (see appendix A). \nValue traps exist when a company appears statistically inexpensive, often based on the P/E as compared to the \nstock\u2019s past or to the market overall, but the future drivers of TSR perform poorly. The two main culprits in the \nbad results are growth below the average and P/E multiple contraction that captures fleeting or elusive prospects \nfor value creation. \nWe explain TSR through drivers including EPS growth and changes in the P/E multiple. We have noted the \nsevere limitations of EPS and multiples to explain value. To compensate, we seek to link these concepts to \nunderlying fundamental drivers. Doing so gives investors and executives a framework to understand the past \nand to anticipate the future.  \nWe decompose the returns for value and growth stocks in recent years (see appendix B). We also include a \nchecklist below for executives and investors who want to consider how the drivers of TSR might unfold in the \nfuture for a company or index of companies.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n6031029 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n21\n \n \nAppendix A: Dividend and Buyback Equivalence\u2014Think Percentage Ownership \nDividends and buybacks have the same impact on corporate value. But executives think of them very differently. \nThey consider dividends to be a commitment tantamount to capital expenditures and buybacks as a way to \nreturn excess cash after they have paid all of their bills and made of all of their investments.47   \nDividends and buybacks can have dissimilar effects on shareholders because of taxes and potential wealth \ntransfers. But they have something important in common: shareholders have to increase their percentage \nownership in the company to earn the TSR either through dividends or buybacks. Not all shareholders can earn \nthe TSR because not all shareholders can up their stake at the same time. \nTo illustrate the concept, let\u2019s go back to the shareholder who owns 100 shares of a $200 stock. Assume that \nthere are 1,000 shares outstanding in total, no debt, and that the stock price accurately reflects the corporate \nvalue of $200,000. Our shareholder therefore owns 10 percent of the company before any disbursement. \nThe company decides to pay out $4,000, or 2 percent of its corporate value. The first thing to note is that the \nvalue of the firm will drop from $200,000 to $196,000 whether it chooses to pay a dividend or buy back shares. \nAll shareholders are treated the same with a dividend. They end up with a stock worth $196 ($196 = $196,000 \n\u00f7 1,000) and a $4 dividend.  \nObservers sometimes suggest that buybacks create or destroy value. They do not. But buybacks can transfer \nwealth. There is a transfer of wealth from sellers to ongoing holders when a company buys back undervalued \nstock, and from ongoing holders to sellers when the stock is overvalued.48 In this case, we assume the stock is \nat fair value, which means the value for ongoing shareholders is $196,000 and the sellers receive $4,000. \nEarning the TSR requires increasing the percentage ownership in the company. But the process is active for \ndividend payments and passive for buybacks.  \nLet\u2019s return to our shareholder with 100 shares of a $200 stock that paid a $4 dividend. To earn the TSR, she \nhad to use the $400 in dividends to buy 2.041 additional shares (2.041 = $400 \u00f7 $196). She now has 102.041 \nshares, increasing her stake in the company from 10 to 10.2 percent. This reflects an active choice to reinvest. \nNow let\u2019s look at what happens with a buyback. Our shareholder starts with the same 100 shares of a $200 \nstock. In this case the company buys 20 shares (20 = $4,000 \u00f7 $200), reducing the shares outstanding to 980. \nThe stock is still worth $200 ($200 = $196,000 \u00f7 980) and our shareholder has increased her stake from 10 to \n10.2 percent (.102041 = 100 \u00f7 980). In this case, the higher percentage of ownership reflects a passive decision \nto hold shares rather than sell them back to the company.  \nOur shareholder could have created a homemade dividend by selling 2 shares. She would then have been left \nwith stock worth $196,000 ($196,000 = $200 \u00d7 98) and cash of $400 ($400 = $200 \u00d7 2). In this case, her stake \nin the company would remain unchanged. Further, if she held shares in a taxable account her tax liability would \nlikely be less than if she had received a dividend.   \nIn practice, dividends and buybacks are different because of tax consequences and the impact of gaps between \nstock price and value. But to understand TSR, the central distinction is between actively or passively increasing \nthe percentage ownership in a company.    \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6031029 Exp. 10/31/2024 \n22\n \n \nAppendix B: Decomposing TSR for Value and Growth  \nOver the past 15 years or so, \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have provided substantially lower TSRs than have \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks. \nValue stocks are those with low multiples of price to sales, earnings, and book value. Growth stocks are \ncharacterized by above-average sales growth, high P/Es, and positive stock price momentum.49  \nThe S&P 500 Value Index tracks the investment return of large-capitalization value stocks in the S&P 500. The \nindex includes about 400 stocks that have an average market capitalization of $60 billion as of September 29, \n2023. The S&P 500 Growth Index draws about 235 stocks from the S&P 500 that qualify as large-capitalization \ngrowth. The average market capitalization was $110 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The stocks of \nnumerous companies are in both indexes.    \nExhibit 16 shows that the annualized TSR from 2007 to 2021 was 7.6 percent for the Value Index and 13.3 \npercent for the Growth Index. We end in 2021 in order to use forward P/Es, but the value index still \nunderperforms the growth index by 330 basis points annualized if we include the returns from 2022. \nWe can compare the drivers to see why the results varied. Companies in the value index grew their net income \nat a 5.2 percent rate during the period, a little slower than the 5.9 percent rate for the members of the growth \nindex. But the translation from net income to EPS was impeded by net equity issuance among the value index \nconstituents and aided by equity retirement for the companies in the growth index. As a result, EPS rose 3.3 \npercent per year for the value index and 8.0 percent for the growth index. \nBoth indexes enjoyed P/E multiple expansion, although the contribution was 1.6 percentage points for the value \nindex and a larger 3.6 percentage points for the growth index. Interest rates dropped over this period and growth \ncompanies have longer implied durations, a measure of the weighted average time investors have to wait before \nthey receive cash flows. Assets with long durations are more sensitive to changes in real interest rates than \nthose with short durations. The growth index likely benefitted more than the value index when rates dropped \nduring this time. \nThe sum of EPS growth and P/E multiple expansion led to price appreciation of 4.8 percent for the value index \nand 11.6 percent for the growth index. Those drivers explain most of the TSR difference between the indexes. \nCompanies in the value index did pay a more generous dividend than those in the growth index, a yield of 2.6 \npercent versus 1.6 percent, and both benefitted fractionally from dividend reinvestment. The contribution of \ndividends closed the gap between value and growth from 6.8 percentage points for price appreciation to 5.7 \npercentage points for TSR. \nThe exhibit also shows the contribution to TSR by driver. One point to underscore is that the change in shares \noutstanding and the dividend can be appropriately considered together. For ongoing holders, buybacks increase \nan investor\u2019s ownership in the company. Reinvesting dividends has an identical effect. Buybacks and dividends \nare more similar than they appear even though we separate them in our calculations.  \nDecomposing past returns allows us to understand the key sources of TSRs and allows us to weigh the likelihood \nof the drivers persisting. The drivers can also be readily linked to macroeconomic considerations such as overall \neconomic growth and changes in interest rates.    \n \n"

Solomon, \n\u201cReconsidering Returns,\u201d The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 35, No. 1, January 2022, 343-393. \n3 The equation approximates the TSR and becomes more accurate as additional years are considered. Here\u2019s \nan example of how it works. Assume a shareholder owns 100 shares of a $200 stock that has annual price \nappreciation of 8 percent and a dividend yield of 2 percent. The company pays the dividend at the beginning of \nthe period. The shareholder reinvests the $400 dividend (100 shares \u00d7 $4 per share) into shares of the stock at \nthe ex-dividend price of $196. This allows the shareholder to acquire 2.0408 shares ($400 \u00f7 $196), bringing the \ntotal ownership to 102.0408. The price appreciation rate tells us the stock ends the year at $216. In the following \nyear, the shareholder can reinvest $440.82 (102.0408 shares \u00d7 $4.32) into the shares at a price of $211.68. \nThis allows the shareholder to acquire 2.0825 shares ($440.82 \u00f7 $211.68), bringing the total ownership to \n104.12. Repeat this process and after about 20 years, the capital accumulation rate is 10.16 percent.    \n4 Jesse M. Fried, Paul Ma, and Charles C.Y.

The equation to determine \nhow much a stock will drop when it goes ex-dividend is as follows: \n \nPb \u2013 Pa = (1 \u2013 td) \n     D        (1 \u2013 tcg) \nWhere Pb is the stock price before the ex-dividend date, Pa is the price after the ex-dividend date, td is the tax \nrate on dividend income, and tcg is the tax rate on capital gains. When governments tax dividends and capital \ngains at the same rate, as is the case in the U.S. in 2023, the decline in the stock price is roughly equivalent to \nthe dividend. If taxes on dividends are higher than those on capital gains, the decline in stock price will be less \nthan the dividend.

In these cases, you can use the Gordon Growth Model, E/(k-g), where E is earnings (a proxy for \ndistributable cash), k is the weighted average cost of capital, and g is the growth in perpetuity. Growth is negative \nif the business is shrinking. As a result, you divide earnings by a higher denominator (subtracting a negative \nnumber is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart), which lowers the value and fair P/E. For example, the \nappropriate multiple is 6.7 times if the cost of capital is 10 percent and the growth is -5 percent (6.7 = 1/[.10 + \n.05]). \n"

For example, if the rate is 15 percent and sales grow $100, working capital will grow by $15. The fixed \ncapital rate equals the capital expenditures minus depreciation that are required as a percentage of the change \nin sales. If capital expenditures are $50, depreciation is $25, and sales grow $100, fixed capital will grow by $25. \nThe fixed capital rate is 25 percent.  \n46 Mihir Desai, Mark Egan, and Scott Mayfield, \u201cA Better Way to Assess Managerial Performance: A New \nMeasure Gets Past the Distortions of Total Shareholder Return and Puts Buybacks into Perspective,\u201d Harvard \nBusiness Review, Vol. 100, No. 3-4, March-April 2022, 134-141. \n47 Alon Brav, John R.

In practice, this distinction is hollow. Value investing \nis buying something for less than it is worth.
