      "text": " \n \nJanuary 29, 2014 \n \nWhat Does a Price-Earnings Multiple Mean? \n2 \nIntroduction2 \n \nThe price-earnings multiple remains the primary method analysts use to value stocks.3 Researchers who \nsurveyed equity research reports found that more than 99 percent of the analysts used some sort of multiple \nand less than 13 percent used any variation of a discounted cash flow model.4 Price-earnings multiples may \nbe a common way to assess the attractiveness of a stock, but most investors fail to have a clear sense of \nwhat a particular multiple implies about a company\u2019s future financial performance and don\u2019t understand how \nmultiples change over time. \n \nThe sloppy use of multiples is almost everywhere you look. In our opinion, some analysts justify their \nrecommendations with apples-to-oranges comparisons of businesses with different economics, suggest \ncompanies should trade at the same multiple as the past without a solid economic justification to do so, and \ncompare price-earnings multiples with growth rates without any mention of the underlying economic returns. \nPrice-earnings multiples are widespread in use yet remarkably poorly understood. \n \nTake as an example two companies, Apple, Inc. (AAPL) and Edison International (EIX), which had the same \nprice-earnings multiple, 12.8, based on year-end 2013 prices and 2014 consensus earnings estimates. \nSetting aside any perceived mispricing, it stands to reason that the prevailing price-earnings multiple implies \nradically different outlooks for these two companies. They are in separate sectors (information technology and \nutilities), with vastly disparate economic returns on capital (AAPL\u2019s CFROI\u00ae is 25 percent versus EIX\u2019s 5 \npercent), substantial variance in the outlook for earnings growth (the expected 5-year earnings per share \ngrowth is nearly 50 percent for AAPL and 7 percent for EIX), and very different capital structures (AAPL has \nnet cash while EIX has a healthy amount of debt). \n \nHow can two companies so unalike have the same price-earnings multiple? Contemplating how these two \nstocks arrive at the same multiple from very different directions provides a mental warm-up for the process of \ncarefully considering what comprises a price-earnings multiple. Without a proper appreciation for the factors \nthat determine a multiple, there is no way to apply it intelligently in exercises of relative or absolute valuation. \n \nThe value of a financial asset is the present value of future cash flows. Few serious market practitioners would \ndisagree. But many investors shun models that project and discount future cash flows because they deem \nthem too complicated or sensitive to assumptions. Yet these same individuals seem blithely content to rely on \nmultiples.  \n \nHere\u2019s the challenge. With discounted cash flow models, the value is sensitive to the inputs. But the \nassumptions underlying the inputs are explicit. You can compare them to base rates, discuss them, and \ndebate them. With multiples, those assumptions are buried. The assigned multiple becomes a point of \npersuasion rather than a thoughtful case based on the economic drivers of value.   \n    \nThe goal of this piece is to provide an analytical bridge between price-earnings multiples\u2014really, multiples of \nany kind\u2014and sound economic reasoning. We\u2019ll start by looking at price-earnings multiples through a classic \nvaluation lens, and will examine the two main components of that model. We\u2019ll finish by discussing the role of \nmultiples in considering price-implied expectations.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 29, 2014 \n \nWhat Does a Price-Earnings Multiple Mean? \n3 \nBack to First Principles \n \nA logical and useful place to start untangling price-earnings multiples is the foundational paper on valuation \nthat professors Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (M&M) wrote in 1961.5 In it, they addressed a \nfundamental question: \u201cWhat does the market \u2018really\u2019 capitalize?\u201d They did not crown a winner among \napproaches that rely on earnings, dividends, or cash flows. Rather, they showed that all of these methods \nyield the same result if you address the problem correctly. \n \nIn the section that demonstrates this theoretical equivalence, M&M offer a formula that is very helpful for \ninvestors. They say that you can separate the value of a company into two parts:6 \n \nValue of the firm = steady-state value + future value creation   \n \nWe can define the terms on the right side of the equation even further: \n \n \n \nThe steady-state value of the firm, calculated using the perpetuity method, assumes that current net operating \nprofit after tax (NOPAT) is sustainable indefinitely and that incremental investments will neither add, nor \nsubtract, value. Using this method implies that NOPAT is constant in nominal terms but that it decreases after \ninflation is considered.7   \n \n \n \nFuture value creation boils down to how much money a company invests, what spread that investment earns \nrelative to the cost of capital, and for how long a company can find value-creating opportunities.  \n \nM&M note that this formula \u201chas a number of revealing features and deserves to be more widely used in \ndiscussions of valuation.\u201d Here are some specific ways the equation can help inform our discussion: \n \uf402\n The equation allows you to disaggregate a price-earnings multiple into a commodity component (the first \nterm) and a franchise component (the second term). This lets you understand how much you are paying \nfor future value creation. \n \uf402\n The central importance of return on incremental invested capital becomes immediately clear. If that return \nis equal to the cost of capital, the value of the equation\u2019s second term collapses to zero. \n \uf402\n The formula shows the impact of growth. For companies that have a large spread between the return on \ninvested capital and cost of capital, rapid growth adds a lot of value. For large negative spreads, growth \nsubtracts a lot of value. Whether growth is good or bad is contingent on the incremental return. As M&M \nwrite, \u201cthe essence of \u2018growth,\u2019 in short, is not expansion, but the existence of opportunities to invest \nsignificant quantities of funds at higher than \u2018normal\u2019 rates.\u201d The \u201cnormal\u201d rate is the cost of capital.    \n \uf402\n The equation shows the potential limitations of relative valuation techniques. Comparing two companies in \nthe same industry with different economic characteristics adds little insight. \n \uf402\n The equation provides a quick sense of the expectations built into a stock.      \nSteady-state value =\nNet operating profit after tax (normalized)\nCost of capital\n+ excess cash\nFuture value creation = Investment * (return on capital \u2013 cost of capital) * competitive advantage period\nCost of capital * (1 + cost of capital)\n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 29, 2014 \n \nWhat Does a Price-Earnings Multiple Mean? \n4 \nThe equation solves for the value of the firm, but it is straightforward to tailor the analysis to the value of the \nequity only. Since: \n \nValue of the firm = debt + equity   \n \nThen: \n \nEquity value = steady state + future value creation + excess cash \u2013 debt    \n \nExcess cash includes cash, marketable securities, and other nonoperating assets beyond what the company \nneeds to run its operations, less any tax consequences of freeing that cash (for example, U.S. companies owe \ntaxes on cash that they repatriate from foreign countries). Debt includes short- and long-term debt plus any \nother relevant claims that are ahead of equity, including preferred stock.  \n \nIn theory, valuing the firm and subtracting debt to arrive at an equity value (unlevered valuation) is equivalent to \nvaluing the equity directly (levered valuation). Appendix A demonstrates this equivalence. In practice it can be \nchallenging to perfectly reconcile the two approaches.   \n \nComponent I: The Steady-State Value \n \nThe steady-state value of a firm is the worth of the business assuming that it maintains its normalized level of \nNOPAT into perpetuity. A company arrives at its steady-state value when its incremental investments earn the \ncost of capital. With the second term of the equation collapsed to zero, all of the firm\u2019s value falls on the \nsteady state.8  \n \nNote that this discussion is independent of growth. A company can continue to grow earnings as it invests at \nthe cost of capital. It will just fail to create value, and hence should trade at its steady-state worth. We can \nreadily translate from the steady-state value to a steady-state price-earnings multiple, which is the reciprocal \nof the cost of equity: \n \n \n \nAs of the beginning of 2014, Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at New York University\u2019s Stern \nSchool of Business, estimated the cost of equity in the United States to be 8 percent.9 This translates into a \nsteady-state price-earnings multiple of 12.5 times. Appendix B discusses the derivation of the cost of equity. \n \nSimplistically, we can say that the market expects a company to create shareholder value if its stock trades at \nabove 12.5 times current earnings. If the stock trades below that multiple, the market is assuming either no \nvalue creation or that future value creation will be insufficient to offset a decline in the current base business. \nIn other words, current earnings are unsustainable. \n \nExhibit 1 shows the appropriate steady-state price-earnings multiple from 1961 through the end of 2013. The \nmultiple started in the high teens in the early 1960s, a period when the cost of equity was low. It then had a \nsteady march downward as both interest rates and the equity risk premium rose, bottoming at just over 5 \ntimes in 1981. Consistent with bull markets in both bonds and stocks, the steady-state price-earnings multiple \nascended, with a recent peak in the late 1990s. Over the full period, the average multiple was 10.4 times with \na standard deviation of 2.7.   \nSteady-state price-earnings multiple =\n1\nCost of equity\n"

Price-earnings multiples are a product of a multitude of \nfactors, including interest rates, inflation expectations, the equity risk premium (itself influenced by sentiment), \nthe business cycle, tax rates, the quality of earnings, growth prospects, and investment opportunities. To the \ndegree to which those factors change over time, it stands to reason that the appropriate multiple will change \nas well. For this reason, appeals to history should be approached with caution. \n \nSince 1961, the steady-state value has explained about two-thirds of the market\u2019s value, on average, and \nanticipated value creation has explained the other third (see Exhibit 2). We calculate this by taking the sum of \nthe operating net income for the S&P 500 over the last four quarters, capitalizing it by the cost of equity, and \nsubtracting the result from the S&P 500 price level.  \n \nFor example, the four quarters of earnings ended September 30, 2013 were $102.20 and the cost of equity \nwas 8 percent, generating a steady-state value of 1,277.50 for the S&P 500. The index closed at 1,681.55. \nThis means that the steady state was 74 percent of the value and that anticipated value creation was the \nother 24 percent.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n1961\n1965\n1969\n1973\n1977\n1981\n1985\n1989\n1993\n1997\n2001\n2005\n2009\n2013\nAverage\n"

In the bear market of 1973 and in the recovery market in 2011, the anticipated value creation was \nnegative. The ratio spiked around the time of the 1987 crash, the dot.com bubble in 2000, and during the \nGreat Recession in 2008-2009. Based on the consensus of estimates for 2014 earnings, the ratio is now in \nthe range of 15-20 percent.    \n \nThese measures are for the market. What about an individual company? Bruce Greenwald, a professor of \nfinance and economics at Columbia Business School, discusses a hypothetical company that makes toasters \nthat he calls, appropriately, Top Toaster. He suggests that Top Toaster\u2019s early successes dissipate as \ncompetition comes along and drives down returns on incremental capital to the cost of capital. At that point, \nTop Toaster will trade at its steady-state price-earnings multiple. It produces a commodity product and earns \nits cost of capital. Greenwald suggests that this is the plight of most companies. Cementing the idea in his \ninimitable style, he says, \u201cIn the long run, everything is a toaster.\u201d10 \n \nTo the degree that Greenwald is correct, companies that end up earning their cost of capital trade at the \nsteady-state price-earnings multiple. If competitive forces are strongly at play, a company\u2019s price-earnings \nmultiple will migrate toward the steady state. Factors that determine the rate of this migration include barriers \nto entry in the industry, the ferocity of competition, and the rate of technological change. Management\u2019s job is \nto mitigate these factors. \n   \nExhibit 3 provides a very simple example of the march toward a steady-state price-earnings multiple. This \ncompany starts with a return on invested capital of 56 percent and a growth rate of 25 percent. Justifiably, the \nstock\u2019s price-earnings multiple is a very high 70 times. We then fade the returns on capital from 56 percent to \n8 percent, the assumed cost of capital, and slow the growth rate from the mid-20s to 5 percent over the \nsubsequent 25 years. The warranted price-earnings multiple glides down from around 70 times to 12.5 times. \nThis is the commodity multiple. \n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1961\n1963\n1965\n1967\n1969\n1971\n1973\n1975\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\nAnticipated Value Creation (%)\n2 standard deviations\n2 standard deviations\nAverage\nCurrent\n"

In these cases, we can modify the steady-state value with a variation of the Gordon \ngrowth model:12  \n \nModified steady-state value = Net operating profit after tax (1 + growth)  \nCost of capital - growth \n \nTake as an example a company that has $100 in NOPAT and a 10 percent cost of capital. The steady-state \nvalue is $1,000 ($100/.10). Let\u2019s now assume that the company\u2019s profit will decline 10 percent per year in \nperpetuity. Note that we are adding a negative value for growth in the numerator, which has the effect of \nreducing the NOPAT. We are also subtracting a negative in the denominator, which has the effect of \nincreasing the discount rate. We calculate the value as follows: \n \n Modified steady-state value =   $100 (1 + -.10)     =     $100(.90)   =     $90     =     $450  \n   .10 \u2013 -.10                     0.20              0.20 \n \nWere this decline accurate and the market to price it properly, the steady-state price-earnings multiple would \nbe 4.5 times ($450/$100).

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 29, 2014 \n \nWhat Does a Price-Earnings Multiple Mean? \n9 \nComponent II: Value Growth Opportunities  \n \nAssuming the current level of earnings is sustainable, we can attribute about one-fifth of the value of today\u2019s \nstock market to future value creation. The M&M formula tells us that there are three key drivers of value \ncreation: \n \uf402\n The spread between the return on incremental invested capital and the cost of capital. \n \uf402\n The magnitude of the investment. \n \uf402\n How long a company can find investments at a positive spread. \n \nThe combination of the first two drivers dictates the rate of growth. To show this relationship, we first need to \ndefine return on incremental invested capital, or ROIIC.  \n \nROIIC = NOPAT1 \u2013 NOPAT0 \n \n              Investment0 \n \nIn plain words, this says that ROIIC equals the increase in NOPAT this year divided by the investment the \ncompany made last year. NOPAT equals the cash earnings of the business assuming no financial leverage, \nand investments include changes in net working capital, capital expenditures net of depreciation, and \nacquisitions.13 There\u2019s a very important simplifying assumption that says that all of the increase in NOPAT is \nattributable to last year\u2019s investment.14 \n \nLet\u2019s examine an example to make this more tangible. Say a company invests $50 in a particular year and \nsees its NOPAT grow by $10 in the subsequent year. ROIIC would equal 20 percent ($10/$50). What if the \ncompany invested $100 to get the same lift in NOPAT? ROIIC would decline to 10 percent ($10/$100). So \nROIIC is a measure of how efficiently a company grows.   \n \nWhen companies and investors think about valuation, they commonly start with growth. But an understanding \nof the first two drivers of value shows why this focus is wrong. If a company is expected to have an ROIIC \nexactly equal to the cost of capital, the second term of the equation collapses to zero and the price-earnings \nmultiple goes to the steady-state level. If ROIIC is above the cost of capital, the second term is positive, and \ngrowth will enhance value. Finally, if ROIIC is less than the cost of capital, growth destroys shareholder value. \nMore rapid growth leads to greater value destruction. \n \nSo whether growth is virtuous depends on the firm\u2019s incremental economic returns. A company can grow its \nearnings per share without creating shareholder value.15 In our view, proper thinking about valuation requires \ndwelling first on the incremental return on investment and only later considering the impact of growth. \n \nExhibit 5 shows the trade-off between returns and growth. Across the top are various assumptions about \nROIIC. Down the side are a range of NOPAT growth rates. In the body are the price-earnings multiples that \nfall out of the relationships. The model generating these multiples assumes that the company is financed \nsolely with equity, has a cost of capital of 8 percent, and that the company can find investments at the implied \nreturn for 15 years. More realistic assumptions do not change the core lessons from the exhibit.16   \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 29, 2014 \n \nWhat Does a Price-Earnings Multiple Mean? \n10 \nExhibit 5: P/Es Given Different Scenarios for ROIC and Growth \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \nNote: Assumes all equity financed; 8% cost of capital; 15-year forecast period. \n \nThere are three fundamental concepts that you can take away from the exhibit. First, a company earning its \ncost of capital will trade at the commodity price-earnings multiple, 12.5 times in this case, irrespective of \ngrowth. You can imagine these companies as being on an economic treadmill: You can speed up or slow \ndown the treadmill of growth and it makes no difference, the companies are not going anywhere. Value \nneutral companies must first figure out how to increase ROIIC before they worry about growth. \n \nSecond, if a company is generating returns in excess of the cost of capital, growth is good. Indeed, all things \nbeing equal, faster growth translates directly into a higher price-earnings multiple. For instance, the warranted \nprice-earnings multiple for a company with a 24 percent ROIIC and 4 percent growth is 16.1 times, whereas a \ncompany with the same ROIIC but a more rapid growth rate of 10 percent is worth 25.7 times. The value of \nhigh ROIIC companies is extremely sensitive to changes in perceived rates of growth. \n \nFinally, companies that earn below the cost of capital on their incremental investments destroy shareholder \nvalue. We can see this clearly in cases when companies overpay for acquisitions and hence transfer wealth to \nthe selling company. Acquisitions are a good example because the acquiring company grows, and in many \ncases the deal is accretive to earnings per share. That many deals grow the business and earnings yet destroy \nvalue is a stark reminder that an acceptable return on incremental investment is paramount.       \n \nAcademic research shows that the stocks of those companies that grow their assets the most rapidly, a proxy for \nsubstantial investment, tend to generate lower returns for shareholders.17 In theory, companies can rank their \ninvestment opportunities in relative attractiveness. The idea is that those companies that invest the most deplete \nthe value creating investment opportunities and dip into investments that are value neutral or value destroying.  \n \nThe final component of future value creation is how long a company can find attractive investment \nopportunities. M&M referred to this as simply \u201cT,\u201d but it is also known as \u201cvalue growth duration,\u201d \u201ccompetitive \nadvantage period,\u201d and \u201cfade.\u201d18 This period is closely related to sustainable competitive advantage. Some \ncompanies are able to find attractive investment opportunities over a long time by virtue of the industry in \nwhich they compete, the strategies they select, the capital allocation choices they make, and some luck.19    \n \nThe period of attractive investment opportunities has attracted considerable research attention.

For \ninstance, research by Brett Olsen, a professor of finance, suggests that the market-implied competitive \nadvantage period averaged about 8 years from 1976-2007, with a span of roughly 5 years for very \ncompetitive industries to 15 years for industries that are more stable.20  \n \nThis range of market-implied competitive advantage periods is tied closely to the reversion to the mean of \nreturns on invested capital. That reversion occurs is incontrovertible, but we also know that the rate of \nreversion to the mean varies by industry, which explains the range that we see in years of anticipated value \ncreation. This says that industries with rapid reversion to the mean justifiably deserve lower price-earnings \nmultiples, as the second term of the equation will be worth less, all things equal, than that of an industry with a \nslow rate of reversion to the mean. Slow fade sectors include consumer staples and health care, and fast fade \nsectors include information technology and energy.21 \n \nRecognizing the persistence of high returns and attractive investment opportunities for some companies within \nits database, Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae developed criteria for \u201ceCAP\u201d companies. These companies are expected \nto find attractive investment opportunities for a longer period than the general population of companies can. \nThe criteria for being an eCAP company, which the HOLT team derived empirically, include a sufficiently high \ninitial CFROI, slow fade, low CFROI volatility, and asset growth that remains in check.22 \n \nA thoughtful assessment of future value creation must balance a sense of ROIIC, growth, and the longevity of \ninvestment opportunities. All of these essential drivers are implicit in a price-earnings multiple but must be \nexplicit in a model based on discounted cash flow. Analysts frequently appeal to past multiples or comparable \nmultiples to make a case for valuation even as the outlook for one or more of these drivers has changed.  \n \nUse of Relative and Comparable Multiple Valuation \n \nA great deal of valuation in the financial community is based on relative or comparable multiples. Specifically, it \nis also common to compare the valuation of one company to a perceived group of peers to judge whether the \nstock is under- or overvalued. Analysts also frequently compare the current valuation of a company or an \nindustry to its past valuation to argue that it\u2019s cheap or dear.  \n \nAt this point, the peril of comparable valuation based on multiples should be clear. Unless the value drivers of \nthe peer companies are very similar to those of the subject company, comparable valuations are baseless. \nMore often than not, disparities in price-earnings multiples are justified given the difference in economic \ncharacteristics of the companies in question. Industry classifications do not always accurately capture \ncompanies of similar economic profiles. \n \nMarket forecasters are fond of comparing today\u2019s price-earnings multiple to multiples of the past to judge the \nprospects of the market. For historical multiples to be relevant to the present, today\u2019s underlying drivers of \nvalue and valuation must be consistent with those of the past. This occurs only when the statistical properties \nof the drivers of stock price returns are stable over time. The fancy term for this stability is \u201cstationarity.\u201d These \ndrivers include interest rates, inflation expectations, tax rates, the equity risk premium, and the composition of \nthe companies within the market. Accounting standards must also be consistent so that earnings represent \nthe same quantity over time.       \n  \nIn fact, each of these drivers has seen a great deal of change over time. Let\u2019s dwell on the equity risk \npremium for a moment. A survey of 150 corporate finance and valuation textbooks found that they \nrecommended a range of equity risk premiums from 3 to 10 percent, and one-third of the books used \ndifferent premiums within their own pages.23 Bradford Cornell, a professor of finance, looked at the equity risk \n"

What \nyou want to compare are the valuations given similar underlying economic drivers. This is true whether \ncomparing the stock of one company to a peer group or comparing valuations over time. At the end of the day, \nprice-earnings multiples are likely too blunt an instrument to do the job effectively.  \n \nOne approach based on a multiple that has received considerable interest in recent years is the cyclically \nadjusted price-earnings (CAPE) model developed by two professors of economics, John Campbell and Robert \nShiller.25 The basic argument is that the long-term expected return for the stock market slumps below average \nwhen the ratio of stock prices to long-term trailing earnings is high. Conversely, long-term expected returns \nare above-average when the ratio is low. We discuss the CAPE model in Appendix C. In recent years, its \nexplanatory power has been limited.  \n \nMultiples and Expectations \n \nThe key to making money in markets is to distinguish between expectations and fundamentals. The \nexpectations in a stock reflect a company\u2019s anticipated financial results. This is the stock price. Fundamentals \nare the future financial performance of the business, including future return on incremental invested capital, \ngrowth, and sustainable competitive advantage. That is value. When price and value get out of line, there is \nopportunity.   \n \nThe expectations investing process has three steps.26 The first is to understand what expectations are \nreflected in today\u2019s stock price. We can use a metaphor of a high jumper\u2019s likely success, where the level of \nthe bar represents the expectations in the stock, and how high the jumper can leap reflects the company\u2019s \nfundamental results. Step one tells us simply where the bar is set.  \n \nThe second step is to determine the company\u2019s likely financial performance. This requires strategic and \nfinancial analysis. Strong financial results are consistent with a lofty jump and poor results with an inability to \ntake off.    \n \nThe final step flows from the first two. It is to make buy, sell, or hold decisions based on the difference \nbetween expectations and fundamentals. We want to know if the company will outperform expectations and, if \nso, whether there is a margin of safety. \n \nAll things being equal, low multiples indicate low expectations. Academics tend to prefer multiples of book \nvalue because of their higher relative stability, but the core idea is the same. Indeed, there is strong evidence \nto suggest that value investing, the purchase of a diversified portfolio of stocks that embed low expectations, \nworks well over time.27 Using the framework that this report developed, low multiple stocks generally have very \nmodest expectations about future value creation. Provided the base business is stable and the company can \ngenerate some value, the stock of a company with low expectations can deliver very attractive returns. \n \nIn practice, most analysts have only a vague idea of what expectations a particular price-earnings multiple \ncaptures. Exhibit 6 shows three companies that all justifiably trade at a 15.0 times price-earnings multiple. In \neach case, the steady-state multiple is 12.5 times and the other 2.5 points come from future value creation. \nThis example holds constant factors such as leverage and the period the company can find attractive \ninvestment opportunities, which further complicates the task of understanding expectations. \n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 29, 2014 \n \nWhat Does a Price-Earnings Multiple Mean? \n14 \nSummary  \n \nHere are some conclusions from this discussion: \n \uf402\n Multiples are not valuation; they are shorthand for the process of valuation. The value of a financial asset \nis the present value of future cash flows. Accordingly, it is essential to understand the components of a \nmultiple and to have a sense of what those components imply about a company\u2019s future financial \nperformance.  \n \uf402\n In assessing capital allocation, consider incremental returns on capital first and growth second. Growth \nonly creates value if the investments generate a return in excess of the cost of capital. Note that this \nreturn need not be immediate. But no company should pursue growth solely for the sake of growth, and \nthe research shows that rapid asset growth is correlated with weak shareholder returns. \n \uf402\n Compare companies based on their business models, not their line of business. For companies to be \ntruly comparable, they must have similar outlooks for incremental returns, growth, and investment \nopportunities. They must also be financed in a similar fashion for a price-earnings multiple to be useful.    \n \uf402\n Be very careful using the past to understand the future. Past multiples are only relevant to the degree to \nwhich the underlying drivers of value are consistent through time. In fact, many of these drivers have \nchanged, greatly diminishing the utility of past averages.  \n \uf402\n This discussion applies to all multiples. While we limited our comments to price-earnings multiples, the \nbasic concepts apply to any multiple. The most commonly used multiples after price-earnings are \nenterprise value-EBITDA (EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and \namortization) and price-to-book value.  \n \uf402\n Be mindful of the quality of earnings. We delved into our discussion using techniques and definitions \n(e.g., net operating profit after tax, investments, and cost of capital) that come from a discounted cash \nflow (DCF) model. The goal of a good DCF model is to avoid accounting vagaries and to zero in on the \ncash flow. Earnings fail to do this, and managements have a great deal of discretion in determining the \nearnings they report. As Alfred Rappaport\u2019s quotation at the beginning of this report reminds us, \u201ccash is \na fact, profit is an opinion.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n"

In \nreality, it can be difficult to get the two to match. But here\u2019s a simple example of the equivalence that works \nunder certain assumptions. This discussion is based on an analysis by Aswath Damodaran, a professor of \nfinance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.28 \n \nAssume that a firm has a market value of $1,000, made up of $750 in equity and $250 in debt. Assume \nearnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $107.7, a cost of equity of 8 percent, a pretax cost of debt of \n6.15 percent, and a tax rate of 35 percent. \n \nFirst, we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as follows: \n \n \n \nNow, we can calculate the value of the firm: \n \n \n \nNaturally, the value of the equity is simply the firm value less debt, or $750 ($1000 - $250 = $750). \n \nNow we calculate the value of the equity directly. Instead of capitalizing after-tax EBIT by the cost of capital, \nwe now capitalize net income by the cost of equity. The differences between unlevered and levered \napproaches include the treatment of financing costs and the tax shield. We assume that financing costs equal \ndebt times the pretax cost of debt.  \n \n \n \nWe can now calculate the value of the equity by capitalizing net income by the cost of equity: \n \n \n \nNaturally, this is a very simple example based on a perpetuity assumption. But you can expand on the basic \nlogic for each year, extending the model into the future.  \n \nAt the outset, we said this equivalence only works under certain assumptions. The first is that the sums for \ndebt and equity that we used to calculate the capitalization are the same as the product of the valuation. The \nsecond is an absence of nonoperating items that would affect net income but not EBIT. The third is that \nfinancing costs equal the pretax cost of debt times debt outstanding. \n \n \nWACC =\n750\n1,000\n.08(\n) + .0615\n250\n1,000\n(\n)\n(\n)\n1 \u2212 0.35\n7%\n=\nValue of the firm = EBIT (1 \u2212 tax rate)\nWACC\n=\n=\n107.7(0.65)\n.07\n=\n70\n.07\n$1,000\nNet income = (EBIT \u2212 financing costs) (1 \u2212 tax rate) = (107.7 \u2013 15.4)(0.65) = (92.3)(0.65) = $60\nValue of equity = $60\n.08\n$750 \n=\n"

You must decide on an appropriate risk-free rate and \nthe means by which you will estimate the equity risk premium. For a detailed discussion of these issues, see \nour report entitled \u201cEstimating the Cost of Capital\u201d (October 8, 2013).  \n \nWhen considering the equity risk premium, you need not fly blind. There are a handful of market-based \nindicators that provide insight into the market\u2019s risk appetite. These include bond spreads, credit default swaps, \nand measures of volatility.  \n \nAswath Damodaran uses a forward-looking model to estimate the equity risk premium. The idea is that he \nknows the price level of the market and can make sensible estimates of normalized growth in the future. He \ncan then impute the equity risk premium by calculating the discount rate that equates the present value of \nfuture cash flows with the prevailing index price.  \n \nExhibit 7 shows Damodaran\u2019s estimate of the cost of equity, as well as its relevant components, over the past \n50 years. The Treasury note yield, the proxy for the risk-free rate, is at the bottom in solid blue, and the \nimplied ERP is on top in striped brown. The sum of the note yield and ERP is the cost of equity, or the \nexpected return for the market. After peaking in the early 1980s, the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s \ndrove down the implied return for the stock market. This explains the varying levels of the steady-state price-\nearnings multiple in Exhibit 1.  \n \nExhibit 7: Historical Implied Equity Risk Premium per Aswath Damodaran, 1961-2013 \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran and Credit Suisse.  \n \n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n20%\n1961\n1965\n1969\n1973\n1977\n1981\n1985\n1989\n1993\n1997\n2001\n2005\n2009\n2013\nEquity Risk Premium / Treasury Note Yield\nEquity Risk Premium, Treasury Note Yield\nImplied Equity \nRisk Premium\nTreasury\nNote Yield\nERP / Treasury \nNote Yield\n"

Some market \nforecasters point to the CAPE ratio as evidence of an overvalued market, while others dismiss the metric as \nfundamentally flawed and too pessimistic.  \n \nJohn Campbell and Robert Shiller, two economists, developed the foundation for the CAPE ratio in a series of \npapers.30 Investors commonly interpret the CAPE to be the ratio of price divided by a ten-year average of \nreported earnings per share, both adjusted for inflation. To illustrate, in early January 2014 the CAPE for the \nS&P 500 was 25.4, with the index at 1828.7 and earnings of $72.11 (1828.7/$72.11 = 25.4). Exhibit 8 \nshows the CAPE ratio since 1881. The average over the whole period is 16.5.  \n \nExhibit 8: Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio, January 1881-January 2014 \n \nSource: Robert Shiller\u2019s home page, see: http://aida.wss.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm. \n \nCampbell and Shiller use ten years of reported earnings because noise and the business cycle heavily \ninfluence short-term earnings. This sidesteps a great deal of the randomness in conventional price-earnings \nratios, which are typically based on one year. The professors also suggest that they were inspired by the \npioneers of security analysis, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, who wrote that one should measure \nvaluation ratios over a period \u201cnot less than five years, and preferably seven to ten years.\u201d31 \n \nThe finance professors argue that the CAPE ratio has strong predictive value. In their original paper, they \ncalculated the CAPE ratio using the S&P 500 Index (or a suitable proxy in the early years) from 1871 to 1987. \nThey did a regression analysis with the CAPE ratio as the independent variable and the subsequent ten-year \nreal returns on stocks as the dependent variable and found a coefficient of determination, or r-squared, of 40 \npercent. The slope of the regression was negative, which means that a high CAPE ratio suggests lower stock \nreturns over the next ten years and a low ratio implies the converse.  \n \nIn recent years, though, implementation of a strategy using the CAPE ratio would have been a challenge. In \nthe 20 years ended 2013, the CAPE ratio was above its long-term average, suggesting caution, for 231 of \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1881\n1888\n1895\n1902\n1909\n1916\n1923\n1930\n1937\n1944\n1951\n1958\n1965\n1972\n1979\n1986\n1993\n2000\n2007\n2014\nAverage\n"

At the same time, the total shareholder returns for the S&P 500 were 11.1 percent (arithmetic) \nand 9.2 percent (geometric), very consistent with total shareholder returns since 1928.      \n \nAs a result, the CAPE ratio has its critics. Some take issue with the fact that CAPE averages earnings over \nten years, a period longer than the typical business cycle. Critics also complain that CAPE uses a measure of \ninflation that has changed over time, making historical comparisons a challenge. The most heated controversy \nsurrounds how much faith to put in today\u2019s high CAPE in the wake of a deep recession that left companies \nwith massive reported losses.32 \n \nJeremy Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has been the most visible \nof the group who call for caution in using the CAPE ratio. While Siegel supports the idea of smoothing \nearnings, he maintains that the CAPE model currently understates future stock market returns.33  \n \nSiegel argues that accounting changes have depressed the reported earnings of the S&P 500 by requiring \nlarge asset write-downs while not allowing for commensurate allowances when assets rise in value. The \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board issued these rules for mark-to-market accounting in 2001. These \naccounting changes dropped reported earnings and exaggerated the price-earnings multiple of the index. This \nchange makes recent readings inconsistent with the historical series.  \n \nTo mitigate this bias, Siegel recommends using operating earnings instead of reported earnings in the CAPE \nmodel. For example, he shows that operating earnings improve the CAPE\u2019s explanatory power. He further \nfinds that using real, after-tax corporate profits from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) makes \nthe model even more effective and eliminates the gross overvaluation that the ratio has suggested in recent \nyears. He concludes that the CAPE ratio is a powerful predictor of real price returns that researchers can \nimprove by using NIPA profits instead of either operating or reported earnings.  \n \nAs a practical matter, the CAPE ratio can be a means to approximate expectations and hence gain a sense of \nfuture market returns. Siegel\u2019s recommendation to use NIPA data also appears sensible as it irons out some \nof the vagaries associated with the accounting changes. In reality, few investors think as far back, and as far \nforward, as the CAPE ratio demands. Price-earnings multiples based on next year\u2019s earnings remain the most \npopular shorthand for valuation, and the correlation between this year\u2019s price-earnings multiple and the returns \nfor the market in the subsequent 12-24 months is effectively zero.34 \n \n \n \n \n"
