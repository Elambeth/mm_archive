      "text": "Diffusion Confusion\n1 August 2001\n2\nExecutive Summary\nThere have been over 4,000 publications on diffusion research over the past 60 years.\nThis body of work documents that product diffusion typically follows an S-curve: product\nsales start slowly, increase at an increasing pace, and then plateau. Products like\nautomobiles and wire line telephones took over 75 years to diffuse while more\ncontemporary products like personal computers and wireless phones diffused in less\nthan 20 years.\nBut the rate of product penetration does not solely define product unit volume. The rate\nat which customers replace their products, or the replacement cycle, is also critical.\nIndeed, most products cross a threshold when replacement unit volumes exceed new\nuser volume. At that point, investors need to redirect their focus to the drivers of the\nreplacement cycle. The report seeks to demonstrate the significance of replacement\ncycle sales in understanding product growth for various industries, including PCs,\nwireless phones, and personal digital assistants.\nWe can point to one counterintuitive conclusion right off the bat. It is possible to have a\nrising population, rising penetration, and a decline in unit volume growth as a result of\nan extension of the replacement cycle. Investors that do not consider the role of the\nreplacement cycle in some detail risk overlooking a major leading indicator of value.\nKey points from this report include the following:\n\u2022 Most investors focus primarily on the rate of new customer acquisition, or rate of\ndiffusion, with the launch of new products. We show that once the diffusion process is\nestablished, replacement cycles surge in importance. We call the undue focus on\nmarket opportunity at the expense of the replacement cycle \u201cdiffusion confusion.\u201d\n\u2022 We develop a three-stage model, and show that once a product reaches Stage II\n(roughly seven to ten years into a product diffusion process), replacement cycles\nbecome critical. Importantly, the need to focus on replacement cycles has become\nmore immediate as products diffuse faster today than in the past.\n\u2022 Replacement cycles are often driven by improvements in a complementary network.\nFor example, more powerful semiconductors spurred more memory-using software,\netc. Wireless handset growth is likely to track the rollout of 2.5G and 3.0G wireless\nnetworks. At some point, however, product performance exceeds customer needs,\nmaking a product vulnerable to shifting preferences or a disruptive technology.\n\u2022 Even a relatively modest shift in replacement cycles can lead to sharp drops in\ncumulative product volumes and growth rates. Investors should realize that a\nsustained shift in replacement cycles has significant implications for a product\u2019s long-\nterm growth.\n\u2022 We show that the replacement cycle is at the crux of the debate about both PC and\nwireless handset growth. We demonstrate the sensitivity to various replacement cycle\nassumptions for 2001 wireless handset volume.\n"

      "text": "Diffusion Confusion\n1 August 2001\n3\nIntroduction\nOver the past decade, investors seeking to forecast industry growth focused primarily\non a pretty straightforward driver: penetration. Just look at the best-selling technology\nbooks, like Geoff Moore\u2019s Crossing the Chasm. Will the market get to critical mass? Will\nit take off into a tornado? These were (and are) fundamental questions, and the models\nto understand network formation remain a vital part of an analyst\u2019s toolbox.1\nBut along the way, another key facet to industry demand has emerged, which analysts\nand investment pundits have not sufficiently heeded: the replacement cycle. Indeed, we\nshow that the replacement cycle is the key variable to watch for a handful of bellwether\ntechnology sectors, including personal computers (PCs) and wireless phones. Once\nreplacement sales become sufficiently large as a percentage of industry unit sales,\nsomething somewhat counterintuitive can happen. Both the target population and\nproduct penetration can grow concurrent with a decline in industry unit volume growth.\nThe culprit in shrinking replacement sales is an extension of the replacement cycle (i.e.,\npeople keep a particular product longer before they upgrade it for a new one).\nIn this report, we identify some frameworks that can help investors understand the\nvaluations and expectations\u2014especially in certain sectors of technology. We first\nexplain why the replacement cycle is more important than ever. We then show a three-\nstage model of technology diffusion and show the relevance (graphically and\nnumerically) of shifting replacement cycles. We finish with a case study of the wireless\nhandset industry, and show the impact a various replacement cycle assumptions on the\nnear-term growth outlook.\n"

      "text": "Diffusion Confusion\n1 August 2001\n4\nWhy the Replacement Cycle Is So Important\nIn order to fully appreciate the role of the replacement cycle in unit demand, we start at\nthe beginning with the diffusion of a particular product. There have been literally\nthousands of studies that show that the typical pattern of product diffusion looks like an\nS-curve.2 Exhibit 1 shows a generic S-curve. We discussed the mechanisms of this\ndiffusion in detail in our \u201cNetwork to Net Worth\u201d report. The process of diffusion is an\nimportant mental model.\nExhibit 1: Generic S-Curve\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\n\u0001\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\n\t\u0007\b\u0004\nWhile the S-curve reflects cumulative product adoption, new adopters plot in what looks\nlike a normal distribution. (See Exhibit 2.) In his seminal book, Diffusion of Innovation,\nEverett Rogers classifies the adopters, from the innovators\u2014the first to try out a new\nproduct\u2014to the laggards, the last group to get involved. While companies launch many\nnew products, very few of them succeed. Passing the critical point in the distribution is\nwhat Geoff Moore calls \u201ccrossing the chasm.\u201d The idea is also consistent with the\n\u201ctipping point,\u201d an idea that Malcolm Gladwell made popular with his best-selling book\nby the same name.\n"

As it turns out, for many\nproducts, it doesn\u2019t take long for replacement sales\u2014not the adoption by new users\u2014to\nbe the most important influence on total unit sales. (See Exhibit 3.) Specifically, within\nfive to seven years of new product diffusion, replacement sales become a significant\npercentage of the total. Often, after a dozen years, replacement sales become the\nmajority of all unit sales.\nExhibit 3: Replacement Sales as a Percentage of Total Sales\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\n\u0005\u0004\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\n\t\n\u0001\u000b\f\r\u000e\n\u000f\r\u000e\u0004\t\n\u0010\u0004\u0011\u000e\r\u0012\u0004\u0003\u0004\u0013\f\u0007\u000f\r\u000e\u0004\t\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\n\u0005\u0004\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\n\t\n\u0001\u000b\f\r\u000e\n\u000f\r\u000e\u0004\t\n\u0010\u0004\u0011\u000e\r\u0012\u0004\u0003\u0004\u0013\f\u0007\u000f\r\u000e\u0004\t\n"

Simply\nstated, if users upgrade the product less frequently, industry unit volume growth suffers.\nAlternatively, shrinking replacement cycles help drive industry unit volume growth. We\nshow the sensitivity of total unit sales to replacement cycles in the next section.3\nThe replacement cycle is more prominent today because product diffusion, like lots of\nother phenomena, happens a lot faster today than it did in the past. For example, it took\napproximately 20 years to reach the current 60% household penetration of PCs in the\nUnited States. It took the television about 25 years to do the same, electricity over 40\nyears, and automobiles in excess of 80 years.4 As a result, the shift from new\npenetration to replacement sales happens sooner for today\u2019s product than for products\nof the past.\n"

      "text": "Diffusion Confusion\n1 August 2001\n7\nThe Three Stages\nBuilding on the above exhibits, we can break a product\u2019s life into three stages:\n\u2022 Stage I\u2014Penetration. Here, the increase is penetration is key. The product is new,\nand getting to widespread acceptance in the main priority. While replacement sales\noften contribute to aggregate unit volumes early on, they tend to be negligible and to\nbe swamped by the importance of attaining new customers. Products in this stage\ninclude personal digital assistants (PDAs) and digital video discs (DVDs).\n\u2022 Stage II\u2014Transition. This is a transition stage, during which replacement sales\nexceed new penetration sales for the first time. The analytical emphasis, then, shifts\nfrom determining the rate of penetration to assessing the length and likely change in\nthe replacement cycle. Products in this stage include wireless handsets (the subject of\nour case study) and PCs.\n\u2022 Stage III\u2014Maturity. In this final stage, the market is penetrated. Unit sales are largely\na function of replacement sales. Products in this stage include fax machines and\nmicrowaves.\nExhibit 4: Three Stages of a Product's Life\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\n\u0006\u0004\u0005\u0007\b\n\t\u0007\n\u000b\f\b\u0007\r\b\n\u000e\u0007\u000f\u0005\u0004\u0010\u0007\u0011\u0007\u0012\u0003\u000b\u0006\u0004\u0005\u0007\b\n\u0001\u0013\u0011\u0007\n\u0006\u0003\u0004\u0014\u0007\u000b\u0015\n\u0006\u0003\u0004\u0014\u0007\u000b\u0015\u0015\n\u0006\u0003\u0004\u0014\u0007\u000b\u0015\u0015\u0015\nExhibit 4 shows the three stages. Given this progression, investors must consider three\nissues. The first is the drivers of the replacement cycle. The second is whether or not\ncustomer needs change as a product matures (they do). The final issue is the impact of\na shift in replacement cycles on unit volume growth.\nSo what drives the replacement cycle? We believe the best answer lies in thinking about\nco-evolution in a complementary network. Let\u2019s break that statement down. There are\nvarious types of networks, and one of the most prominent is a complementary\nnetwork\u2014that is, the value of the network is contingent on complementary products.\nExamples of complementary networks include DVD players and DVDs, computer\n"

Improvements in the price-to-value relationships of complementary products\noften spur upgrades, or replacements. Some investors call this the \u201ckiller application\u201d\ndriver.\nPerhaps the canonical example over the past 15 years is the Wintel standard\u2014\nMicrosoft\u2019s PC operating system/applications and Intel semiconductors. More powerful\nchips\u2014spurred on by Moore\u2019s Law\u2014suggest more sophisticated and memory-using\nsoftware. This co-evolution spawned ongoing upgrades, enriching the whole PC\nindustry. Indeed, the hot topic today in judging PC unit growth is the impact of Windows\nXP will have on demand. Bulls argue that it will create replacement demand while the\nbears suggest that consumers have all they need. Ironically, Intel recently admitted that\nit was lengthening its own PC upgrade cycle from three years to three and a half years\nin order to save costs.5\nWhile it is tempting to assume perpetual upgrades as technology advances, innovation\nguru Clay Christensen suggests that technologies \u201ccan advance faster than market\ndemand\u201d and can hence \u201covershoot\u201d their market. As a result, customer needs and\ndemands change\u2014often away from performance toward price and convenience\u2014and\nthe overshoot paves the way for potential disruptive technologies.6 The message to\ninvestors is that they must consider not only the co-evolution of products but also the\npoint of product overshoot. PCs may already be there today.\nThe last point is the main message of this report. Once an industry reaches Stage II,\nyou can see rising population, rising penetration, and down industry unit volume growth\nif the replacement cycle lengthens. Since replacement units are a significant percentage\nof total units, the decline in replacement unit volume that results from the shift in\nreplacement cycle exceeds the increase in unit sales as a result of penetration.\n"

Scenario 1 assumes that the replacement\ncycle remains at 2 years through a 15-year diffusion process. Scenario 2 assumes that\nthe replacement cycle shifts from two to three years after year five. The result is a down\nyear in unit sales in what is an otherwise \u201cgrowing\u201d industry. (Exhibit 10 shows the data\nthat support these charts.)\nBut the long-term implications are actually quite a bit more dramatic. The shift from 2 to\n3 years also reduces cumulative industry unit volumes about 25% and reduces the\nproduct\u2019s 15-year compounded annual sales growth rate by 400 basis points (from 31%\nto 27%). While our scenario is meant only to illustrate the phenomenon, it is not hard to\nimagine that fairly sizable changes in expected growth rates follow shifts in the\nreplacement cycle.\nNeedless to say, the replacement cycle math can also work for investors. Indeed, we\nestimate that the replacement cycle had been shortening for the wireless handset\nmarket until this year.\nThis replacement cycle affects a number of industries, including:\n\u2022 Personal computers. PC analysts note that industry sales over the past two years\nhave suffered from a lack of compelling applications to justify user upgrades.\nMicrosoft recently released information about the minimum hardware requirements for\nits Windows XP operating system, which include a 233MHz processor and 64MB of\nRAM.

      "text": "Diffusion Confusion\n1 August 2001\n11\nCase Study\u2014Wireless Handsets\nThe global wireless handset market provides a good case study highlighting the\nimportance of replacement rates. In the late 1990s, the industry was in Stage I, with unit\nvolume growth from new users constituting over 60% of the industry\u2019s total unit. Further,\nindustry unit growth rates were typical of a Stage I industry, consistently exceeding\n50%.\nIn 2000, however, the industry appeared to transition to Stage II. Replacement units\nwere nearly one-half of total units sold. The story shifted from a focus primarily on\npenetration to a combination of penetration and replacement cycle. In fact, the\nreplacement cycle drove sharp unit growth in 2000, as users upgraded models faster\u2014\nevery two and a half years on average. (Total sell-through is the sum of new user units\nand replacement cycle units.) Exhibit 6 summarizes the numbers.\nExhibit 6: Wireless Handset Subscriber Growth, 1996\u20132000\nYear\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\nSubscribers\n133,000\n204,000\n309,000\n478,000\n700,000\nNew users\n71,000\n105,000\n169,000\n222,000\nReplacement Cycle Units\n37,000\n63,000\n113,000\n189,000\nSubscriber Growth %\n53%\n51%\n55%\n46%\nReplacement Cycle Years\n3.6\n3.2\n2.7\n2.5\nReplacement Cycle Growth %\n70%\n79%\n67%\nTotal Sell Through\n108,000\n168,000\n282,000\n411,000\nPRICE\n$220\n$198\n$178\n$160\nMARKET SIZE\n$237,600\n$332,640\n$502,524\n$659,162\nUnit Growth\n56%\n68%\n46%\nMarket Size\n40%\n51%\n31%\nSource: CSFB estimates.\nQuestions abound about the demand for wireless handsets in 2001, and we can now\nsee how important the replacement cycle is in shaping the outcome. Exhibit 7 outlines\nthree potential scenarios for 2001 growth, based on our estimates.7 Our forecast is that\nthe total number of new users will drop from 222 million in 2000 to 215 million in 2001.\nAs a result, whether or not there is growth in total sell-through for 2001 depends on the\nreplacement cycle. The impact on growth expectations is dramatic as Exhibit 7\ndocuments. Consider the following scenarios (2000 total unit sales were 411 million):\n\u2022 If the replacement cycle expands to 2.9 years (from 2000\u2019s 2.5 years), replacement\nunits will grow to 241 million, and will, for the first time, exceed the number of units\npurchased by new users. In addition, aggregate unit growth will expand by 11% for\nthe year to over 456 million units.\n\u2022 If the replacement cycle expands to 3.3 years, replacement units will rise modestly\nand total units will expand 4%, to 427 million units. This is the scenario we believe is\nmost likely.\n"

This conclusion, while\ncounterintuitive, reflects the fact that as an industry matures it becomes more and more\ndependent on repurchase sales by its existing user base. Investors are well served to\nisolate these numbers for companies where the phenomenon applies.\nThis analysis can serve as a leading indicator of value and forces investors to focus\ntheir efforts on analyzing specific product lines for potential catalysts that affect the\nupgrade cycle. Staying attune to upgrade cycle sales can help investors identify\npotential opportunities as the upgrade cycle contracts or avoid situations where the\nupgrade cycle may be expanding.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager or co-manager\nof a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies mentioned.\nAll prices as of July 31:\nEricsson (ERICY) $5.36\nIntel (INTC) $29.81\nInternational Gaming Technology (IGT) $51.98\nNokia (NOK) $21.81\nMicrosoft (MSFT) $66.19\nMotorola (MOT) $18.69\nResearch In Motion (RIMM) $23.53\n"

The value of securities and financial instruments is subject to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such\nsecurities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADR\u2019s, the values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk.\nStructured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and assuming the risks involved.\nThe market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity,\nmarket conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer.

High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that investment is realised.\nThose losses may equal your original investment. In the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in such circumstances you may be required to pay more money\nto support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and in consequence initial capital paid to make the investment may be used as part of that income yield.\nSome investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such\nan investment is exposed.
