We define sustainable competitive advantage as a \ncompany\u2019s ability to generate returns on investment above the cost \nof capital, and higher than its competitors, for an extended period.  \nExecutives seek to position their companies strategically to attain \na competitive advantage. In the process, they have to consider \nindustry dynamics, including barriers to entry, and figure out how \nto perform activities differently, or perform different activities, than \ntheir competitors.2 Companies can also create shareholder value \nby allocating capital judiciously.  \nInvestors commonly seek to buy the shares of businesses that can \ncreate value over time. These companies are often said to be \nsurrounded by an economic moat that preserves profitability and \nkeeps competitors at bay.3 Of course, investors need to be \nsensitive about the price they pay. But businesses with a \nsustainable competitive advantage can be attractive because their \nvalue grows over time.  \nInvestors often treat analysis of competitive advantage and \nvaluation as separate tasks. But they should be done together. \nAlfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at the Kellogg School of \nManagement at Northwestern University, made this point clearly in \nhis seminal book, Creating Shareholder Value. He wrote, \u201cIt is \nimportant to establish that the economic forces governing industry \nattractiveness . . . influence prices, quantities sold, costs, \ninvestments, and the riskiness of the industry. These variables, in \nturn, are the building blocks for the value driver determinants of \nshareholder value.\u201d4 You need to understand the elements of \ncompetitive advantage to value a business intelligently. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

For example, a company that has a technology protected by a patent may be a differentiated producer \nand deliver a high return on investment. You start with the sources and end with the outcomes.5 \nExhibit 1: Traditional Competitive Strategy Analysis \n \nSource: Based on George S. Day and Robin Wensley, \u201cAssessing Advantage: A Framework for Diagnosing Competitive \nSuperiority,\u201d Journal of Marketing, Vol. 52, No. 2, April 1988, 3 and Bruce Greenwald and Judd Kahn, Competition \nDemystified: A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy (New York: Portfolio, 2005). \nThis report takes a different tack. It starts by examining market share and asks whether market share, and \nrelated concepts, can help inform the analysis of industry structure. This will take us on a journey that includes \nlife cycles, market share, concentration, markups, intangibles, and \u201csuperstars.\u201d We will study the link between \nsome of these variables and return on investment and provide some analytical tools along the way. We finish \nwith some case studies to see how these ideas apply to a handful of industries.  \nThis work is important because economic theory tells us that return on investment in excess of the opportunity \ncost of capital gets eroded by competition. There is regression toward the cost of capital. An industry where all \ncompetitors earn the cost of capital is in competitive equilibrium.  \nResearch in strategic management has a different point of emphasis than that in economics. Strategy seeks to \nexplain sustainable competitive advantage by looking at individual companies and how they differ. Economics \ntends to treat firms in broader classes, old versus young or incumbent versus challenger, with an emphasis on \naggregates. Notably, the antitrust literature draws much more heavily on research in economics than in strategy.6  \nUnderstanding competitive advantage helps us anticipate the rate at which regression happens. The slower the \nrate of fade, the longer a company can sustain its competitive advantage. Companies with strong competitive \nadvantages preserve high returns longer than their competitors do.7  \nA study of market share is useful because it can provide insight into entry and exit dynamics and industry stability. \nHow a firm gains or loses market share can shed light on the distinction between more traditional markets, where \nmultiple competitors grapple for share, and those with strong network effects, which often culminate in one firm \ndominating the industry.    \nWe also need to understand the link between market share and firm profitability. A strong market share position \ncan lead to attractive profitability for good or bad reasons. Good reasons include the benefit of economies of \nscale, where bigger companies have lower costs than smaller ones and hence can provide consumers with a \nSources of Advantage\nCompetitive Advantage\nPerformance Outcomes\n\u2022 Proprietary technology\n\u2022 Unique input costs\n\u2022 High switching costs\n\u2022 High search costs\n\u2022 Habit formation\n\u2022 Low-cost producer\n\u2022 Differentiated producer\n\u2022 Market share\n\u2022 Low customer churn\n\u2022 Attractive profitability\nReinvest in business to sustain advantage\n"

Bad reasons reflect anti-competitive behavior, cases where leaders stymie \nthe competition and resulting prices are higher than they would be otherwise.8 Debates about potential antitrust \nactions are based on this distinction. \nDefining Market Share \nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines market share as \u201cthe percentage of the market for a product or service \nthat a company supplies.\u201d9 Market share is an outcome of a company\u2019s product or service offering, distribution \nchannels, marketing initiatives, and customer relationships. Some markets tend toward winner-take-most \noutcomes.10   \nLee Cooper and Masao Nakanishi, professors of marketing, suggest that market share analysis should be \ncompetitive, descriptive, and profit-oriented.11 Competitive emphasizes that any assessment must be in the \ncontext of the position and decisions of competitors, including potential entrants. Descriptive captures the market \nstructure and the potential impact of marketing initiatives on product performance. Profit-oriented considers how \nchanges in market share lead to changes in profitability. \nWhile market share is straightforward in concept, there can be considerable challenges in attaining reliable \nfigures. For example, defining the market requires judgment. Take automobiles as a case. Does it make sense \nto measure market share for all vehicles sold? Or does reflecting segments such as sedans versus sport utility \nvehicles provide insight? What is the appropriate geographic scope? Should market shares be considered on a \nlocal, regional, national, or international level? When does that matter? Finally, should you measure market \nshares using revenues (units sold times price divided by total revenue) or units (units sold divided by total units \nsold)?12   \nMarket structure is defined by the number and distribution of firms within an industry.13 Two aspects of market \nshare, stability and concentration, can provide insight into potential sustainable competitive advantage.    \nMarket Share Stability \nMarket share stability is conducive to sustainable competitive advantage, whereas instability makes it more \ndifficult to create value over time. Instability can be the result of multiple sources, including new entrants, \ncompetitive actions, technological change, and shifts in consumer demand.14 Market share instability provides \ninsight into the nature of rivalry and is a measure of mobility within the industry.15    \nMethods to measure market share stability have been around for more than a half century. Bruce Greenwald, a \nprofessor emeritus of asset management and finance at Columbia Business School, popularized an approach \nbased on average absolute value market share change.16 You examine the market shares for each company \nwithin an industry over two periods, usually three to five years apart, and calculate the absolute value of the \nchange for each. You use those figures to calculate the average absolute value change.   \nExhibit 2 provides an example for the United States (U.S.) automobile industry for the 5 years from 2016 through \n2021. While some firms lost share (General Motors) and others gained share (Tesla), the average absolute \nvalue change was about one percentage point. We consider any average below two to be a low level of \ninstability.  \n \n"

The first is to see how many companies are in the industry. The \nother is to see if new names appear on the list or old ones disappear. Lots of companies and the emergence of \nnew competitors typically suggest that barriers to entry are low.   \nA couple of factors are particularly important in considering the rate of entry and exit. The first is where an \nindustry is in its life cycle. As an industry is born, it is common for the number of entrants to rise sharply in the \nearly years and then to fall over time.17 Market shares tend to show a great deal of instability early on and settle \ndown over time. For instance, the average absolute value change of the big three automobile manufacturers, \nGeneral Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, was nearly 10 from 1925 to 1929. Identifying winners can be very \nchallenging shortly after an industry launches.18 \nThe second factor is the rate of entry. One of the key functions of a capitalist system is to efficiently shift \nresources from industries that destroy value to those that create value.19 Low barriers to entry and exit, as well \nas low friction on capital flows, encourage this process.  \nIndustries with high returns on investment attracted entrants from the mid-1970s through about the year 2000. \nBut since then, high returns have no longer correlated with free entry. Research by the economists Germ\u00e1n \nGuti\u00e9rrez and Thomas Philippon suggests that neither economies of scale for the incumbents nor higher entry \ncosts explain this decline in entry. They contend that the main culprit is the rise of regulation.20 \nGuti\u00e9rrez and Philippon argue that the rise has been geared less toward public interest regulation, which seeks \nto protect consumers and address negative externalities, and more toward public choice regulation, which \nprimarily benefits incumbents. Regulation, along with the substantial investments in intangibles by big firms, \nhave created large, fixed costs that have impeded the entry and growth of small firms. Exhibit 4 shows the rise \nin the number of regulations and the entry rate for technology firms.21 Entry by technology firms peaked around \n2000 and has drifted lower in recent decades. \nExhibit 4: The Rise of Regulations and Firm Entry for Technology, 1978-2019 \n \nSource: (New firms) U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies, Business Dynamics Statistics; (Restrictions) Patrick \nMcLaughlin, Jonathan Nelson, Thurston Powers, Walter Stover, and Stephen Strosko, RegData US 4.0 Annual (dataset), \nQuantGov, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, 2021; Counterpoint Global. \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nNumber of Restrictions (Thousands)\nNew Tech Firms (Thousands)\nNew Firms\nRestrictions\n"

All rights reserved. \n5980466 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n6\n \nAn analysis of market share stability offers insight into how market shares change over time. But it does not \npaint a complete picture of how market share is distributed. For that, we need to examine concentration.  \nMarket Concentration  \nMarket concentration quantifies \u201cthe extent to which market shares are concentrated between a small number \nof firms.\u201d22 There are two main ways an industry can become concentrated. The first is through consolidation. \nFor example, the number of aerospace and defense prime contractors went from 51 to 5 during the 1990s.23 \nThe second is the result of winner-take-most outcomes that are characteristic of some industries.24    \nThe relationship between minimum efficient scale (MES) and the total addressable market (TAM) is one way to \nthink about the number of competitors and the degree of potential concentration.25 MES is the level of output at \nwhich a firm reaches its long-term average cost. It is based on the relationship between a company\u2019s sales and \nfixed costs, or costs that do not change with output. A company that has not reached MES will be at a \ndisadvantage to a larger competitor. MES therefore provides an indication of how much market share a company \nrequires to be competitive.26 \nTAM is the sales a company could attain if it had 100 percent share of a market it could serve while creating \nvalue. TAM is not about how large an industry can be but rather how large it can be while adding value.  \nYou should always think about scale relative to competitors. Big firms in a large industry may not have any \nadvantage when compared to one another. For example, eight global automobile manufacturers had sales in \nexcess of $100 billion in 2021. Likewise, a little firm in a small industry may have an advantage. MES and TAM, \nwhich can change over time as the result of shifting consumer preferences and technological advances, should \nbe part of any consideration of concentration. \nAs with market share, there is a lot of debate about how to measure concentration. Different methods can lead \nto different conclusions about the same industry. One method is to measure the market share held by some \nnumber of companies. This is often designated by the letter \u201cC\u201d and the number of companies measured. For \nexample, a C4 concentration calculation adds up the market shares of the largest four industry participants. \nThe most common approach for estimating concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which \nweights market shares. Specifically, the index is the sum of the squares of the market shares of the 50 largest \nfirms in an industry times 10,000. For industries with fewer than 50 firms the amount is the sum all firms. For \ninstance, for an industry with four companies and market shares of 50 percent, 25 percent, 15 percent, and 10 \npercent, the index would be 3,450 ([(.50)2 + (.25)2 + (.15)2 + (.10)2] \u00d7 10,000 = 3,450).  \nThe virtue of the HHI is that it considers not only the number of firms in an industry but also the distribution of \ntheir sizes. It measures inequality. A large firm in a fragmented industry may be able to impose discipline on its \ncompetitors. HHI is commonly used in assessing whether deals are anti-competitive, and an HHI in excess of \n2,500 is considered a \u201chighly concentrated\u201d market.27  \nExhibit 5 shows how these measures can offer different messages. In the first scenario, the top four competitors \nhave equal share, leading to a C4 of 80 percent and an HHI of 1,800, deemed to be a \u201cmoderately concentrated\u201d \nmarket. In the second scenario, one company has one-half of the market even as the top four still share 80 \npercent. Now the HHI soars to 3,000 and the market is considered to be highly concentrated. In practice, \nhowever, these metrics generally come to similar conclusions.28    \n"

Do we care about local or national \nconcentration? Which tells us more about the nature of competition? Some studies show that national \nconcentration has risen in recent decades even as local concentration has declined for some industries, \nincluding retail stores.29 Particular assumptions embedded in the measurement create the dichotomy between \nthe figures for national and local concentration.30   \nDefining an industry can also be tricky. Researchers calculate HHI using the Standard Industrial Classification \n(SIC), the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), and the North American Industry Classification \nSystem (NAICS). The results can differ markedly based on which metric a researcher uses to measure the \nindustry.31 \nThe basic intuition is that high concentration suggests limited competition, which explains why HHI is used as a \ntool to assess whether a merger and acquisition (M&A) deal is considered anti-competitive. Likewise, low \nconcentration is consistent with lots of competition. These important caveats regarding measurement \nnotwithstanding, we would like to know whether concentration is up or down in recent decades.  \nThe answer is it depends on whom you ask. Some studies find clear evidence for rising concentration and \nexplore the implications for industry returns in excess of the cost of capital.32 For example, one analysis suggests \nthe HHI for U.S. public companies has gone from less than 1,000 in the mid-1990s to more than 1,600 today.33  \nOther studies find limited evidence for increases in concentration.34 One showed the industries with the largest \nincrease in the C4 ratio from 2002 to 2017 included declining sectors such as newsprint mills and radio networks.  \nIn a point related to entry, the data show that the probability of a firm in the top four dropping out of that group \nrose steadily from 1980 and peaked around 2000. This suggests these leaders were being disrupted at a rising \nrate. Since then, however, the probability has dropped steadily, which is consistent with a decline in disruption.35   \nThe core limitation of concentration measures, including C4 and HHI, is that they are not reliably linked to \nsustainable competitive advantage or stock returns.36 It appears market share provides a better link to profitability \nthan does concentration.37 We now turn to the link between market share and attractive return on investment. \n"

Exhibit 6 provides a simple example. On this chart, the horizontal (x) axis measures quantity and \nthe vertical (y) axis reflects price. The demand curve shows the willingness to pay (WTP) of consumers. They \ndemand a low quantity of a good or service when the price is high, and demand rises as the price falls. \nThe supply curve reflects the cost for producers. Suppliers will provide lots of a good or service when prices are \nhigh, and the willingness to sell (WTS) drops as the price does. \nThe equilibrium price is at the intersection of the demand and supply curves, where the willingness to pay and \nthe marginal cost of production meet. The price will equal this cost in theory because a producer that has a cost \nlower than that of its competitors will drop its price to grow its market share.  \nIn a competitive setting, the price migrates toward the marginal cost. This is what George Stigler, the economist \nquoted at the top of this report, meant when he said, \u201cthe rate of return on investment tends toward equality in \nall industries.\u201d The marginal cost includes the cost of capital. Companies will have a return on investment equal \nto the cost of capital, which means they neither create nor destroy shareholder value. \nConsumers who have a willingness to pay above the price realize a surplus because they are getting something \nfor less than what it\u2019s worth to them. Consumer surplus captures the utility, or satisfaction, that consumers \nperceive. The triangle in the upper left corner reflects this aggregate value.  \nExhibit 6: Supply and Demand Curves and Competitive Equilibrium \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nCompetitive \nPrice\nConsumer \nSurplus\nDemand\nSupply\nSupply\nDemand\nMarginal \nCost\nCompetitive \nQuantity\nPrice\nQuantity\n"

This requires realizing a \nprice that is above the marginal cost. Economists call this ability \u201cmarket power,\u201d which is defined as \u201cthe ability \nof a firm to raise prices above costs and generate excess profits.\u201d40 Industries and companies with market power \nearn an economic profit, a return on investment in excess of the cost of capital.  \nExhibit 7 shows the same demand and supply curves, but rather than the price set at marginal cost, the higher \nprice reflects market power.

All rights reserved. \n5980466 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n10\n \nHow Companies Create Value \nThe combination of market power and a framework for understanding how companies create and capture value \nprovides a way to understand the connection between market share and economics. This model of how \ncompanies add value was developed by two professors of strategy, Adam Brandenburger and Harborne Stuart, \nand considers value creation from the point of view of buyers, the company, and suppliers.41 Felix Oberholzer-\nGee, a professor of strategy at Harvard Business School, has brought the ideas to life with robust frameworks \nand vivid examples.42   \nExhibit 8 shows what Oberholzer-Gee calls the \u201cvalue stick,\u201d which allows us to think about a company\u2019s ability \nto create value on two levels. The first is the gap between willingness to pay and willingness to sell. WTS is the \nlowest price at which a supplier is willing to sell their good or service. The difference between willingness to pay \nand price is consumer surplus, as we have seen. The difference between cost and the willingness to sell is \nsupplier surplus. For example, you might imagine the company paying an employee (cost) more than the salary \nat which she would be indifferent to working (WTS). In this case the employee would enjoy a supplier surplus. \nOberholzer-Gee argues that companies should strive to increase willingness to pay and to lower willingness to \nsupply. This shifts demand and supply curves, creates the opportunity for consumer and supplier surplus, and \nleaves plenty of room for the company to create value. The economic pie, from suppliers to customers, grows.43 \nExhibit 8: A Value Stick Shows How Market Share Can Add Value \n  \n \nSource: Based on Felix Oberholzer-Gee, Better, Simpler Strategy: A Value-Based Guide to Exceptional Performance \n(Boston, MA: Harvard Business Review Press, 2021), 14. \n \nWillingness to Pay\n\u2022 Network effects\n\u2022 Complements\n\u2022 Products and services\nPrice\nCost\nValue \nCreation\n\u2022 Reduce supply cost through data\n\u2022 Productivity\n\u2022 Employee relations\nWillingness to Sell\n"

A more formal definition of \neconomic profit is return on invested capital (ROIC) minus the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), times \ninvested capital. ROIC is defined as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by invested capital.  \nFor instance, if a company\u2019s ROIC is 13 percent, its WACC is 8 percent, and its invested capital is $1,000, the \neconomic profit is $50 ([.13 - .08] \u2715 $1,000 = $50). A company creates value when its economic profit is positive, \nwhich means the present value of the cash flows from its investment are worth more than the cost.  \nIt is important to add that just because a company has earnings does not mean that it is creating shareholder \nvalue. Investments can generate earnings that are positive but fail to earn the cost of capital. This results in a \nnegative economic profit. For this reason, the link between earnings growth and value creation is tenuous.44    \nOberholzer-Gee shares some of the main ways to increase willingness to pay and lower willingness to sell. \nThese concepts are very consistent with generic strategies to gain a competitive advantage, including \ndifferentiation (achieve a premium price by raising WTP), cost leadership (have prices below the competition as \nthe result of a lower WTS), and focus (serve a narrow slice of customers better than competitors can).45 These \nmethods are also a structured way to evaluate barriers to entry. The key is to consider how expanding the gap \nbetween WTP and WTS makes higher market share more profitable than lower market share.  \nLet\u2019s start with willingness to pay at the top of exhibit 8. While most firms focus narrowly on growing sales, \nOberholzer-Gee argues their emphasis should be on enhancing WTP by delighting their customers. We briefly \ndescribe the levers he discusses to increase WTP and to potentially add pricing power:46 \n\u2022 Network effects. A network effect exists when the value of a good or service increases as more people \nuse the good or service.47 Network effects come in different forms. Direct network effects exist when \nmembers can connect with one another without having to deal with an intermediary. Telephone networks \nare the archetype. Indirect network effects exist when there are complementary assets, such as electric \nvehicles and charging stations. Network effects are also pertinent for platform businesses that match two \nsides of a market. The ride-sharing companies, Uber and Lyft, are a good case in point.48 \nPositive feedback, where the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker, is key to understanding how \nnetwork effects come about. This is very different than negative feedback, where the strong get weaker, \nthe weak get stronger, and there is regression toward the mean. Most businesses are subject to negative \nfeedback. But there are commonly battles, at least early on, to determine the winner in industries where \npositive feedback is relevant. (If you want to see a long history of these, type \u201cformat war\u201d into your search \nengine.) One classic example is Video Home System (VHS) versus Betamax.  \nThe outcomes of these business skirmishes are rarely evident in real time.49 For instance, Facebook rose \nto be the leading social network by passing a number of competitors that appeared formidable. Fox \nInteractive, mostly driven by MySpace, a Facebook competitor, briefly received more page views than the \ncombined Yahoo! sites in late 2006.50 Yahoo! had been the top company at that time. MySpace was well \nahead of Facebook.  \nReaching a position of dominance increases WTP because of network effects.51 Consumer surplus \nnaturally rises if the company does not raise the price of its good or service. Some social media sites are \nfree to consumers but gather enormous amounts of information about their users. They can then use this \ninformation to monetize their market-leading position through advertising. The value to advertisers \n"

A complement is a good or service that is consumed with another good or service. \nExamples include hot dogs and hot dog buns, razors and razor blades, and cars and gas stations. When \nthe cost of a product goes down, the WTP for its complement goes up. As a result, firms that figure out \nhow to lower the cost of complements, or even give them away for free, can shift the demand curve up \nand increase the WTP for their own product.54 That was likely part of the thinking of Alphabet, the parent \nof Google, when it made the Android mobile operating system free to handset manufacturers. More mobile \nhandsets using Android meant more consumers using Google search.55 \nFirms that offer complements can still compete with one another. They are sometimes called \u201cfrenemies.\u201d \nThey are friends because they recognize that their businesses are more valuable together, and enemies \nbecause they dual about how to divide the value that is created.  \nOne recent illustration is the relationship between Apple and Meta Platforms, which owns the social media \nsites Facebook and Instagram among other businesses. The iPhone has been a key way that users \naccess the Facebook and Instagram applications, and Meta\u2019s applications were among the most \ndownloaded in Apple\u2019s App Store. The companies also discussed a number of ways of working together.56    \nPrior to 2021, advertisers would send information to Meta about customer purchases from their app, along \nwith the identifier for advertisers (IDFA). Meta combined the specific purchase information with other third-\nparty data that tracked a consumer\u2019s activity across a range of applications, websites, and physical stores. \nThe combination of first- and third-party data allowed advertisers to target ads effectively and therefore \nincreased the WTP for ads on Facebook. \nIn April 2021, Apple introduced App Tracking Transparency, or ATT, which requires users to opt in to be \ntracked. A majority of users did not. That meant that advertisers could no longer send Meta the IDFA, \ndegrading the ability to target consumers. As a result, the return on investment and WTP for advertisers \ndeclined. These advertisers include about 10 million small and medium businesses.57  \nSocial media companies and advertisers felt the full effect of these changes in 2022. Meta Platforms has \nseen a hit to revenue of about $10 billion in 2022, and other social media businesses have also suffered.58 \nThis story shows how the change in one company\u2019s policy can affect the economics of its complement.  \nDistinguishing between complements and substitutes can be a challenge. Complements increase WTP \nand substitutes decrease WTP. Oberholzer-Gee shares the example of a digital form of The Washington \nPost. One survey found that many readers consumed both the printed and the online version, suggesting \nthe products are complements. But some readers consumed the online version only, meaning the digital \n"

Discerning the difference requires an analysis of the patterns of usage and \ntrends. Properly structured experiments can also help tease out cause and effect. \n\u2022 Products and services. Higher WTP is associated with goods and services that are more useful, confer \nmore status, and create more consumer pleasure. For example, companies can earn the reputation of \nputting the interests of the consumer first, combine existing technologies to create useful opportunities for \ncustomers that are new, and make sure that the company\u2019s business model is not based on a negative \naspect of the consumer experience.59  \nAnother method of lifting WTP is reducing search costs. One series of experiments showed that \nrecommendations based on the taste of the participant increased WTP.60 Most e-commerce and video \nstreaming sites have recommendation engines. The algorithms behind these engines tend to improve with \nmore data about consumer choices. More appropriate recommendations further reduce search costs and \ninform the algorithm, creating positive feedback that benefits WTP. \nSome consumers purchase goods or services by habit, which are defined by automaticity and a lack of \nconscious deliberation.61 Habitual behavior differs based on the consumer or category, but research \nshows that WTP is higher for products purchased by habit.62  \nWe turn our attention to the bottom of the value stick and examine WTS and cost.  \nEconomies of scale, the idea that the cost per unit declines as output rises, is as relevant for cloud computing \nand software development as it is for semiconductor and automobile manufacturing. We reviewed two important \nideas in our discission of concentration and minimum efficient scale. The first is that understanding MES is \nhelpful in assessing barriers to entry. The second is that you should always assess MES relative to competitors. \nThere are cases where businesses have network effects (demand-side scale) and economies of scale (supply-\nside scale). Think of Google as an example. As Google adds users it can gather more information about them. \nThis is valuable to advertisers because it improves the efficiency of their digital advertising. The ad dollars that \nGoogle collects, in turn, allow it to further improve the search functionality and hence add value for its users. \nThat is the demand side. \nGoogle is now very big, which allows it to spend sums on fixed costs that are very hard for competitors to match. \nThis is the supply side. For example, it is estimated that Google pays Apple around $18 to 20 billion a year to \nmake Google the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.63 Google\u2019s strong market share translates \ninto demand- and supply-side scale that leads to robust profitability.     \nConsumers enjoy a surplus and so do suppliers. Supplier surplus is the difference between cost and WTS. \nCompanies that focus solely on cost overlook the opportunity to lower WTS, which can help reduce their own \ncost while preserving or even adding value for their suppliers. Lowering WTS shifts the company-supplier \nrelationship from zero-sum to win-win.  \nHere are some ways to reduce WTS: \n\u2022 Reduce supply cost through data. Most companies have digitalized to some degree, which has \nimproved the ability to capture the preferences and purchase habits of their customers. This can be \nvaluable to a supplier, lowering WTS, because it is information the supplier can use to become more \nefficient. For example, information sharing between Walmart and one of its suppliers, Procter & Gamble, \nled to lower inventories and higher sales.64  \n"

Consider a supplier that today earns a 12.5 percent profit margin (net \noperating profit after taxes \u00f7 sales) and has 1.2x capital turnover (sales \u00f7 invested capital) for an ROIC of \n15 percent (12.5% \u2715 1.2 = 15.0%). Now its customer provides data about what products are selling and \nthe patterns of purchase that help the supplier better manage its inventory. This reduces the supplier\u2019s \ninvested capital and increases its capital turnover to 2.0x. The supplier can now lower the price of its \nproduct to the equivalent of a 7.5 percent profit margin while still earning a 15 percent ROIC (7.5% \u2715 2.0 \n= 15.0%). Even better, the supplier can reduce the price to a 10 percent margin, which creates surplus for \nthe supplier while adding value for the customer. \n\u2022 Productivity. There are large differences in productivity within industries.65 For example, economists \nfound that U.S. manufacturing plants in the 90th percentile of productivity generated nearly twice the output \nof those at the 10th percentile. This lowers the company\u2019s cost and also lowers WTS as the company \nneeds fewer inputs to generate the same output as its competitors. These differences often relate to scale, \nwhich in turn reflects the ratio of fixed to variable costs. Scale is a big deal when fixed costs are high. \nThe learning curve, which describes the ability to reduce unit costs as a function of cumulative experience, \ncan also lower cost and WTS. Studies of the learning curve for hundreds of products show that a doubling \nof cumulative output reduces unit costs by about 20 percent for the median firm.66 Learning curves come \nfrom accumulated experience and know-how while economies of scale are the result of larger output as a \nfunction of cost. The concepts are distinct but often go together. \n\u2022 Employee relations. There are a couple of ways a company can increase employee satisfaction, a form \nof supplier surplus. The first is to pay employees more. This redistributes value from the company to the \nemployees unless there is an offsetting reduction in costs. Some firms pay more than the market rate for \nemployees because it lowers employee turnover, which reduces costs for hiring and training.  \nThe problem with pay as a simple lever of supplier surplus for employees is that empirical studies show a \nweak correlation between compensation and employee satisfaction.67 However, a culture that fosters \nintrinsic motivation can lower WTS and increase employee satisfaction.68 Components of intrinsic \nmotivation include autonomy, mastery, and a sense of purpose.69 Autonomy is the feeling of being in \ncontrol and mastery means there is a good match between an employee\u2019s abilities and the opportunity to \ngrow. A sense of purpose means that an employee feels that his or her efforts contribute to a greater \ngood. Employees who are intrinsically motivated do seek fair pay. But companies can enhance productivity \nand create employee surplus by building a favorable culture.  \nData also help manage employees effectively. For instance, service companies that understand product \ndemand can match work flows to staff schedules appropriately. This lowers the company\u2019s cost and makes \nemployees happier.  \nThe digitalization of business, the process of converting analog information into a digital format that can be more \neasily presented, analyzed, saved, and shared, is a constant thread through this discussion. On the one hand, \ndigitalization may appear to erode the sustainable competitive advantage. The newspaper industry is a vivid \nexample. As advertising shifted from print to digital form, large newspapers that rely on advertising revenues \nwere unable to cover the large, fixed costs associated with content creation, printing, and distribution of physical \nnewspapers.  \n"

Microsoft\u2019s decades-long leadership in the personal computer \noperating system business and extraordinary profitability, measured by cash flow and ROIC, are a case in point. \nA handful of professors of strategy from the Norwegian School of Economics provide a framework for assessing \nwhen the combination of big data and network effects help or hinder the stability of competitive advantage.70 \nThey note that big data is distinct from traditional data because of greater volume, velocity, and variety.  \nThe professors suggest companies can be categorized in a two-by-two matrix, with one axis capturing the \nimportance of big data and the other the importance of network effects (see exhibit 9). Most are \u201cdigitalized \nfirms,\u201d found in the lower left box of the quadrant, which use digital technology but where big data and network \neffects are not significant. They cite examples including manufacturing firms seeking to improve efficiency via \nautomation and restaurants and hotels that provide online booking. Competitive advantage is unstable, they \nargue, because competitors can readily adopt new technologies and therefore a company with a competitive \nposition will be defined by its resources and capabilities.  \n\u201cData-driven\u201d companies are in the bottom right quadrant. Big data is important for these companies, but network \neffects are not strong. These businesses include mapping services, market research firms, and autonomous \ndriving. Here, the source of advantage is the uniqueness of data or the ability to analyze it, which is mitigated by \ngreater access to datasets across industries and the fast-following in data analytics. As a result, competitive \nadvantage is unstable. \nIn the upper left quadrant are \u201cnetwork firms,\u201d where network effects are important but the gathering and use of \nbig data is limited. This includes companies with direct or indirect network effects, such as messaging services \nand gaming consoles. The nature of network effects plus the associated lock-in make the competitive \nadvantages these businesses enjoy more stable. \nThe final quadrant, in the upper right corner, are the \u201cdata-driven network firms.\u201d Companies here include many \nof the large-capitalization technology companies, where network effects and big data are both important. These \nbusinesses have the most stable competitive advantages if they use their data to improve WTP and there is \npositive feedback between gathering data from their users and making the offering more valuable to new and \nprospective users. These reinforcing mechanisms allow for sustainable competitive advantage. \nMichael Porter, a professor of strategy at Harvard Business School, introduced a framework to analyze industry \nstructure based on five forces (bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of sellers, substitution threats, \nrivalry among firms, and threat of new entrants).71 The prior discussion covered many of the elements within in \nthe Porter framework. Bruce Greenwald and Judd Kahn write, \u201cWe have simplified Porter\u2019s approach by \nconcentrating first on the force that dominates all others: barriers to entry.\u201d72 Exhibit 10 summarizes where the \nmajor sources of barriers to entry, which address the threat of new entrants, appear on the value stick.  \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5980466 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n17\n \nMeasuring Market Power \nA company is said to have market power when it can set the price of its good or service above the marginal \ncost.74 Economists use a \u201cmarkup\u201d to measure this market power. Estimating markup can be thorny and there \nis more than one approach to doing so.75  \nOne widely used approach is as follows:76 \nMarkup = production function [(price \u2715 quantity) \u00f7 (costs \u2715 input)] \nLet\u2019s go through the right side of the equation. The production function, denoted by the Greek letter theta (\u03b8), \ndescribes the relationship between output and input.77 Empirically, the average production function is around \n0.85. The output is captured in price \u2715 quantity. The input is reflected in costs. Classic inputs include labor and \ncapital.  \nMarkup, symbolized as \u00b5, is the production function times the output divided by input. The concept is \nstraightforward in theory but getting accurate figures for output and input is a challenge.78 One approach is to \nuse financial statements, with sales as a measure of output and cost of goods sold (COGS) as a measure of \ninput. COGS are the direct costs related to product sales. The equation is: \n\u00b5 = \u03b8 (Sales/COGS) \nFor example, a company with $1,000 in sales, $850 in COGS, and a production function of 0.85 will have a \nmarkup of 1.0 (1.0 = 0.85[1,000/850]). In this case price equals the marginal cost. A company with the same \nsales and production function that has COGS of $680 would have a markup of 1.25 (1.25 = 0.85[1,000/680]).  \nMarkups can go up because of higher prices and the same cost or the same price and lower costs. One group \nof economists found that consumer surplus per capita has increased substantially since 2006 in spite of higher \nmarkups as the result of a shift in consumer preferences.79  \nMarkups Without Intangibles  \nThe basic story that has roused the interest of academics and policymakers is summarized in exhibit 11. \nAggregate markups in the U.S. were flattish from 1955 through 1980 and have climbed steadily since then. In \nother words, it appears that market power has increased in the last four decades.80 This has coincided with a \nrise in regulation and robust M&A activity. \nEconomists also note that labor share, the ratio of labor compensation to value added, has declined in the U.S. \nas well as other developed countries in recent decades (although it is up since the global financial crisis of 2008-\n2009).81 Value added is the difference between revenues and intermediate inputs and is split between the factors \nof production, labor and capital. In a simple sense, markups hurt labor because when the price of a good or \nservice exceeds its marginal cost, demand will naturally decline. Lower demand means fewer employees are \nnecessary to satisfy that demand.   \nThere also appears to be a correlation between markups and cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae).82 Both \nare relatively flat from 1955 through 1980 and climb steadily through 2019 (see exhibit 12).  \n \n \n"

In so doing we will touch two other \ninteresting facets of the rise in markups. Then we will add an important twist. \nMost researchers in this field who use financial statements rely on Compustat. Our universe is the constituents \nof the Russell 3000 index, which tracks the largest stocks by market capitalization in the United States, at the \nend of each year. We exclude financials and real estate.83 Our data run from 1990 through 2021. \nWe calculate the markup for each company as the production function \u2715 Sales/COGS. Production functions \nmay differ slightly by industry and year, but for simplicity we used a production function of 0.85, which is the \nlong-term average and median for the population.84 We then determine an aggregate markup by weighting \ncompanies based on sales. \nExhibit 13 shows the results of our replication. The aggregate markup in 1990 is nearly identical to that in exhibit \n11 and the trend over the subsequent 30 years is similar. Our figures, especially in later years, are lower than \nwhat some other researchers have found. Part of the explanation is that we do not include the financials, \ninsurance, and real estate industries in our calculation and others do. Those industries have among the highest \nmeasured markups, lifting the aggregate.85  \nAnother part is a quirk in how Compustat presents the data.86 When a company does not provide an allocation \nbetween COGS and SG&A for depreciation, depletion, and amortization, Compustat generally deducts the full \namount against COGS.

But other scholars remain more \ncircumspect in their assessments about the data and what they say.90 For example, markups in the order of \nmagnitude suggested by some approaches are \u201ctoo large to be credible\u201d and some of the implications of the \nincrease in markups, including the impact on inflation, are not borne out by the data.91   \nMarkups seek to capture the relationship between sales and marginal costs. Most approaches that use financial \nstatement analysis measure costs with COGS. The question is whether there are intangible costs that these \nmodels do not capture and, if so, whether that changes the picture.  \nMarkups With Intangibles  \nHere\u2019s where things get more complicated. Companies have always invested in tangible and intangible assets. \nBut intangible investments have grown at a much faster pace than tangible ones over the decades that markups \nhave increased.92 As a result, COGS may understate costs, which means that markups calculated simply with \nsales and COGS are overstated. The point that intangibles are poorly reflected in the data has been made by \nmany scholars in the fields of accounting and economics.93 \nThis rise in intangibles suggests that input costs should include items that are reflected in selling, general, and \nadministrative (SG&A) expense. While SG&A technically captures costs not directly related to production, the \nargument is that COGS are a declining percent of a firm\u2019s total variable cost.94  \nMeghana Ayyagari and Vojislav Maksimovic, professors of finance, collaborated with the economist Asli \nDemirguc-Kunt to estimate markups with a more complete definition of cost.95 They use a widely-accepted \nmethod to adjust the estimate for cost to reflect a component of SG&A.96 This approach first deducts research \nand development (R&D) from total SG&A and assumes that 30 percent of the remaining SG&A is an investment \nand the other 70 percent is a cost.97 So the markup equation, including intangibles, is as follows: \n\u00b5 = \u03b8 [Sales/(COGS + SG&A \u2013 R&D \u2013 0.3(SG&A \u2013 R&D))] \nLet\u2019s look at Snowflake, Inc., a cloud computing-based data warehousing company, to see how capturing these \ncosts changes the result. This is an extreme example but shows how meaningful the adjustment can be.  \nHere\u2019s the markup for fiscal 2022 based solely on COGS (income statement items are in millions of dollars) and \nusing a production function (\u03b8) of 0.85: \n\u00b5 = \u03b8 (Sales/COGS) = 0.85($1,219/458) \u2248 2.25  \nHere\u2019s the markup after giving consideration to costs reflected in SG&A and bumping up \u03b8 to 0.95 to reflect the \nhigher input: \n\u00b5 = \u03b8 [Sales/(COGS + SG&A \u2013 R&D \u2013 0.3(SG&A \u2013 R&D))]  \n   = 0.95[1,219/(458 + 1,476 \u2013 467 \u2013 0.3(1,476 \u2013 467))] \u2248 1.00 \nThese calculations provide conclusions about market power that are starkly different, from well above average \nto unity. We acknowledge that there is a lively debate about how best to extract costs from SG&A but believe \nthat ignoring SG&A in the analysis of markups yields a distorted picture.  \nCompanies with high gross margins and low operating profit margins will have large differences between their \nunadjusted and adjusted markups. The adjustment has minimal effect on companies with low gross margins and \npositive operating profit margins.  \n"

While some evidence that the \nmarkups for firms in the top quintile rose over the time we examined, exhibit 18 shows that the effect is \nsubstantially more muted after adjustments. \nExhibit 18: Markups by Quintile with Intangible Adjustment, 1990-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Russell 3000 index excluding financials and real estate; minimum of $0.1 million sales, COGS, SG&A, and R&D.  \nOne important insight is that superstar firms tend to substantially outspend their competitors on intangible \nassets.98 James Bessen, executive director of the Technology and Policy Research Initiative at the Boston \nUniversity School of Law, builds on this point and describes three developments that allow superstar firms to \ndifferentiate themselves from their peers to sustain a competitive advantage. First, these companies invest \nheavily in proprietary software. Bessen shows that the growth in spending for software has vastly outstripped \nthat for R&D, advertising, and acquisitions.99 Overall, companies in the U.S. spent about $240 billion on \nproprietary software, and those expenditures were heavily skewed toward the largest firms.100   \nNext, he argues that the use of software has allowed superstar firms to go beyond simple economies of scale \nto provide differentiated offerings as well. Academics often suggest companies pursue either a strategy of cost \nleadership or differentiation and avoid trying to do both and risk getting \u201cstuck in the middle.\u201d101 The application \nof proprietary software allows large firms to now deliver scale and complexity in a way not possible in the past.102  \nFinally, the sheer complexity of the software and the lack of incentives to share mean that the diffusion of \ntechnology is slower now than it was in prior generations. For this reason, it is difficult for competitors to close \nthe productivity gap and the minimum efficient scale for potential challengers is on the rise.103 \nAyyagari et al. also calculate the ROIC for each company. They find that about 40 percent of superstar firms, as \nranked by ROIC, are in technology, 20 percent in manufacturing, and 13 percent in healthcare.104 A company\u2019s \nROIC is lower after reflecting adjustments for intangible investments. We estimate that Microsoft\u2019s ROIC (using \naverage invested capital) for fiscal 2022 goes from 49 percent to 34 percent with adjustments.105  \nWhat you conclude about market power has a lot to do with how you choose to measure markups and which \ndata you use. There has been a rise in markups in recent years if the consideration of costs is restricted to \nCOGS. But this pattern largely disappears if a component of SG&A is considered a cost, which would be \nconsistent with a rise in intangible investment.    \n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2.0\n2.4\n2.8\n3.2\n3.6\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nMarkups (Medians)\n"

Since the end of World War II, concentration has \ndropped, new manufactures have entered, and profitability has gradually eroded. The industry now faces the \nprospects of migrating from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles in the coming decades.   \nExhibit 19 provides a snapshot of market share in the U.S. measured by units sold. We see that 6 producers \nhave a market share between roughly 10 and 15 percent. One estimate of minimum efficient scale for auto \nassembly is about 250,000 units per year per factory.107 About one-half of the autos sold in the U.S. are imported.  \nExhibit 19: Market Share for the U.S. Automobile Industry, 2021 \n \nSource: goodcarbadcar.net and Counterpoint Global. \nThe concentration in the U.S. automobile industry has been driving lower for the last 60 years, as revealed in \nexhibit 20. The peak of this series, achieved in 1962, was an HHI of 3,391, well above the threshold of what is \nconsidered to be a highly concentrated industry. The most recent reading for the HHI is 1,051, considered to be \nan unconcentrated market. The C4 concentration ratio shows a similar decline.  \nWhile some of this decline is the result of consolidation, the majority reflects the loss of market share of the top \ntwo producers. In 1965, General Motors\u2019s market share was 49.6 percent and Ford\u2019s was 26.8 percent, \ncombining for more than three-quarters of the market.

All rights reserved. \n5980466 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n34\n \nConclusion \nThis report starts by asking whether a study of market share and measures that relate to market share, such as \nstability and concentration, can help evaluate whether a company has a sustainable competitive advantage.  \nWhile we believe this analysis provides useful indicators, developing a clear picture is challenging because it is \ndifficult to capture what we care about. Issues here include what classification you use to measure industries, \nwhether you examine local or national results, and if and how costs associated with intangibles should be \nreflected in the analysis. Further, causal mechanisms matter. A company that gains market share as the result \nof an advantage in economies of scale is fine. A company that gains market share by illegally hampering \ncompetition is not. Assigning causality can be hard.   \nMarket share can be difficult to analyze because there is latitude in defining the boundaries of industries and \nmarkets. This analysis should consider the moves of competitors, reflect the market structure, and provide a link \nbetween changes in market share and profitability. \nAchieving a sustainable competitive advantage is difficult for a business that competes in an industry where \nthere is instability in market share. As a general observation, market share instability tends to be high as an \nindustry emerges. During this phase competitors jockey for market fit and new competitors join the fray. Market \nshares then become more stable as the industry shakes out.  \nAnalysis of stability offers a good occasion to examine the rate of entry and exit, as well as the barriers to entry \nand exit. The rise of regulation in the last few decades appears to have depressed the rate of entry. \nMarket share instability tends to be unfavorable for sustainable competitive advantage, but market share stability \ndoes not ensure it. Industries can be stable near a point of competitive equilibrium, which precludes any \nmeaningful value creation. \nMarket concentration as a broad metric has little to say about industry profitability. Measuring concentration, as \nwith market share, presents challenges because of method, data source, and the level of geographic specificity. \nFor instance, some studies show an increase in national concentration and a decrease in local concentration at \nthe same time.   \nConcentration can be the result of a few processes, which have varying implications for economic profit. The \nfirst is that one company has some advantage, usually associated with economies of scale, relative to its \ncompetitors. Concentration can also occur through consolidation as a result of M&A. The U.S. airline industry is \na good example. Finally, concentration may be the result of a battle in a winner-take-most market. The internet \nsearch industry is a good case in point.  \nAny analysis of concentration is a good time to consider minimum efficient scale and the total addressable \nmarket. The important point to keep in mind is that scale for an individual company is relative to its competitors. \nSome industries, such as the global auto industry, are large enough to accommodate a number of companies \nthat operate at minimum efficient scale. This tends to result in industry ROICs that are close to the cost of capital.  \nThere is a lively debate about the degree to which concentration has changed in recent decades and what that \nmeans for competitiveness. The conclusions differ based on the approach the researcher takes to measure \nconcentration. One thing to bear in mind is that regulators do consider concentration as part of an assessment \nof industry competitiveness.   \n"

All rights reserved. \n5980466 Exp. 9/30/2024 \n35\n \nMarket power measures the degree to which a firm can set its price above its marginal cost. A firm with market \npower creates value by earning a return above its cost of capital. An expansive view of value creation goes from \nthe customer\u2019s willingness to pay to a supplier\u2019s willingness to sell. Between those extremes lie a company\u2019s \nprice and cost. The difference between willingness to pay and price is consumer surplus, and the difference \nbetween cost and willingness to sell is supplier surplus. A company can create an opportunity to enhance market \npower by increasing willingness to pay and decreasing willingness to sell. Further, most of the classic barriers \nto entry can be mapped onto the framework that considers everything from willingness to pay to willingness to \nsell. \nMarkups are the classic way to measure market power. There are various approaches to estimating markups. \nOne popular approach solves for the markup by taking the ratio of output to input times a production function. \nUsing financial statements, sales is commonly used as a proxy for output and COGS for input, or marginal cost. \nThe average production function is around 0.85. An open question is whether a markup is a better measure of \nmarket power than ROIC or even gross margin.   \nStudies have identified provocative patterns in markup data. Specifically, markups appear to have been largely \nflat from the mid-1950s through 1980 and have ascended steadily since then. The rise in markups has not come \nfrom changes between industries but rather from increased dispersion within industries. This has led to the \nconcept of superstar firms, which have distinguished themselves from their industry peers.      \nSome research suggests that superstar firms are those that have invested heavily in proprietary technology that \nis not shared with other firms. This software allows these businesses to capture scale, manage complexity, and \ndifferentiate from competitors.     \nThis is consistent with research showing that intangible investments have risen sharply in recent decades. This \nmeans that COGS may underestimate the marginal cost. Introducing a fraction of SG&A as an additional cost \nchanges the aggregate picture. The rise in markups since the 1980s largely disappears and the rise of superstar \nfirms, while still detectable, becomes vastly more muted. Here again, the answer you get depends on the \nquestion you ask. \nThere has been increased interest in antitrust action abroad and in the U.S.115 Big technology companies have \nbeen one of the focuses of regulatory attention. At a minimum, there will likely be greater scrutiny in M&A deals, \nmore distraction, heightened scrutiny of pricing actions, and continued lobbying to offset the risks. That said, the \nambiguity in quantifying measures such as concentration and market power mean that demonstrating harm to \nconsumers and competition can be a challenge. Political and public sentiment toward large companies has \nvacillated between positive and negative many times in the last 125 years.116      \nOur case studies highlighted traditional industries, autos and airlines, along with digital industries, internet search \nand word processing software, with winner-take-most outcomes. Examining the development of these industries \nover time shows how the dynamics for market share, concentration, and markups differ. It is important to note \nthat picking winners is easy after the fact. The market share instability for the internet search market, for example, \nwas extremely high in the early days. \nWe can now take stock of the link between market share and sustainable competitive advantage. Here are some \nobservations: \n\u2022 Look for lopsided market shares. These tend to be the result of winner-take-most markets.

The risk here is that another network comes along and \nunseats the current incumbent. \n\u2022 Market share stability. Market shares are generally unstable as an industry emerges and settle down as \nit matures. It is challenging for a company to sustain a competitive advantage in an unstable industry. But \na stable industry does not promise excess returns.  \n\u2022 Be alert to the potential of new entrants. Clayton Christensen, who was a professor at Harvard Business \nSchool, developed the theory of disruptive innovation.117 Challengers approach a segment of the market, \nusually at the low end, with a new business model that commonly lowers minimum efficient scale.118 Once \nthat competitor establishes a toehold, it can address additional segments of the market and drain excess \nprofits from the incumbents. Consider barriers to entry and how they are affected by WTP, price, cost, and \nWTS. Assess if and how regulation creates a barrier to entry.    \n\u2022 Low market share inequality. Some industries have multiple competitors with a difference in market \nshare that is modest. The important consideration is the nature of the industry, especially with regard to \nfixed and variable costs. For high fixed-cost businesses, it is important to consider minimum efficient scale \nwhile recognizing that scale is not about absolute size but rather size relative to competitors. \n\u2022 Duration of market share leadership. How long a company with leading market share remains at the \ntop is a function of how big the gap is between the leader and the nearest rival, market instability, and the \nfactors that drive market share change, such as barriers to entry, marketing spending, and product and \nprocess innovation. The first two determinants can be determined quantitatively. The third one can be \nmodeled but generally requires judgment.119 As noted earlier, the rate at which leaders are getting \ndisrupted has declined since 2000. \n\u2022 Look for companies that have consumers with a high willingness to pay or an ability to increase \nthe willingness to pay of customers over time. Some offerings do not have dominant market shares \nbut do have a high willingness to pay. This is typical of well-regarded luxury brands. These businesses \noften have pricing power. Other businesses increase WTP through network effects or managing \ncomplements effectively.      \nThe appendix includes a list of companies with wide economic moats based on market share that Josh Jarrett, \ndirector of research at Counterpoint Global, has collected (exhibit 36). This group of businesses has posted \nCFROIs that are substantially higher than the average of an aggregate of companies in popular stock market \nindices (exhibit 37). Good businesses are not always good investments, but consistent value creation tends to \nbe an investor\u2019s ally.   \n \nPlease see important disclosures on pages 55-57 \n \n \n \n \n"

A consumer should in theory \nprovide the same figure for WTP and willingness to accept (WTA), the amount an individual would accept to not \nuse a product or service. But surveys often show a large gap between the two. Cass Sunstein, a professor at \nHarvard Law School, surveyed individuals in 2018 about their per month WTP and WTA for a handful of social \nmedia platforms. Here are the results: \n"

With CFROI, HOLT aims to cut through the \nvagaries of traditional accounting results and to provide a consistent metric that allows for comparison of \nperformance over time and across a portfolio, a market, or a global universe of companies. HOLT calculates \nCFROI for a company using two steps. First, it measures the inflation-adjusted gross cash flows available to all \ncapital owners and compares that to the inflation-adjusted gross investment made by the capital owners. \nSecond, it translates this ratio into an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) by recognizing the finite economic life of \ndepreciating assets and the residual value of non-depreciating assets. CFROI is a trademark or registered \ntrademark of Credit Suisse Group AG or its affiliates in the U.S. and other countries. \n83 To be more specific, we exclude companies with the following NAICS codes: 52 (Finance and Insurance), 53 \n(Real Estate and Leasing), 55 (Management of Companies and Enterprises), 92 (Public Administration), and 93 \n(Unclassified Establishments). We also exclude companies with less than $0.1 million of annual sales, cost of \ngoods sold (COGS), selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, or research and development. All data \nare calendarized. \n84 Mike Konczal and Niko Lusiani, \u201cPrices, Profits, and Power: An Analysis of 2021 Firm-Level Markups,\u201d \nRoosevelt Institute, June 2022.  \n85 This includes NAICS sectors 52, \u201cFinance and Insurance,\u201d and 53, \u201cReal Estate and Rental and Leasing.\u201d \nHaving these sectors in the results lifts the aggregate markup about 0.20-0.25. See Jan De Loecker, Jan \nEeckhout, and Gabriel Unger, \u201cThe Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications\u2014Online \nAppendix,\u201d December 10, 2019.  \n86 Eric D.

Here is the relevant passage from the paper \n(emphasis added): \u201cThe Compustat income statement format presents a separate line item for both cost of \ngoods sold (Compustat COGS; hereafter, C_COGS)1 and depreciation, depletion, and amortization (Compustat \nDP). To accomplish this, S&P modifies data from 10-K filings so that the DP variable can be created and \npresented without altering bottom-line net income. When a company reports the allocation of DD&A among \nspecific line items (e.g., COGS and SG&A expenses), S&P will remove the specified amounts of DD&A from \neach of the items indicated and will collect all DD&A in the DP variable. However, when companies do not \ndisclose the allocation of DD&A among line items, S&P will still collect all DD&A in the DP variable, but they will \nalso subtract total DD&A from other line items within the financial statements. Most often, the entire amount of \nDD&A is deducted from COGS.\u201d Further, some estimates of markups include financials, insurance, and real \nestate companies. These are among the highest markup industries and suffer from measurement challenges. \nRemoving these industries lowers the aggregate markup considerably but does not change the general trends. \nSee Appendix 10 in Jan De Loecker, Jan Eeckhout and Gabriel Unger, \u201cOnline Appendix for The Rise of Market \nPower and the Macroeconomic Implications,\u201d December 10, 2019. \n87 Our approach follows that of Konczal and Lusiani. We calculate changes within each sector as: (Sector\u2019s \nshare of total sales at end of prior year) \u2715 (Average markup for all companies in that sector for the current year \n\u2212 Average markup for all companies in that sector for the prior year). We then sum that for all sectors. We \ncalculate changes between each sector as: (Sector\u2019s share of total sales at end of current year \u2212 Sector\u2019s share \nof total sales at end of prior year) \u2715 (Average markup for all companies in that sector for the prior year). We \nthen sum that for all sectors. For both series, we then calculate the cumulative sum over time since the beginning \nof our measurement period (1990/1991). \n88 Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen, \u201cThe Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms;\u201d \nPrasanna Tambe, Lorin Hitt, Daniel Rock, and Erik Brynjolfsson, \u201cDigital Capital and Superstar Firms,\u201d NBER \nWorking Paper 28285, December 2020; and Alexander Schiersch and Caroline Stiel, \u201cTesting the Superstar \nFirm Hypothesis,\u201d Journal of Applied Economics, Vol. 25, No. 1, 2022, 583-603.
