This trend has \naccelerated in recent years. The investors who are shifting from active to passive are less informed than \nthose who stay. This is equivalent to the weak players leaving the poker table. Since the winners need \nlosers, this can make the market even more efficient, and hence less attractive, for those who remain. If \nyou can\u2019t identify the patsy, or weak player, it\u2019s probably you. \n  \uf402\n Active management provides price discovery and liquidity. These are valuable social goods. However, the \nfees are higher for active managers than passive ones, identifying skill ahead of time is not easy, and \nthere is a cost to assessing skill. Average fees for the industry have declined as the result of the rise of \npassive investing, and closet indexers have been the biggest losers. \n \uf402\n Passive management has lower costs than active management and hence delivers higher returns per \ndollar invested than active management does in the aggregate. However, passive management \nintroduces the possibility of market distortions, including crowding and illiquidity. Exchange-traded funds, \nin particular, are worth watching closely because of their explosive growth and high trading volume. There \nis evidence that passive investing has had an influence on valuations, correlations, and liquidity. \n \uf402\n How efficiently inefficient markets are determines the appropriate balance between active and passive. \nMore active management can lead to more efficiency and an inducement to go passive. More passive \ninvestors and noise traders may create more inefficiency and hence opportunity for active managers. \n \uf402\n Four drivers have led to the development of the mutual fund industry and, more recently, to the shift \ntoward passive investing. These include regulation, the market environment, technology, and the balance \nbetween informed and uninformed investors. In particular, technology has contributed a great deal to \ninformational efficiency as a result of advances in the speed and cost of information dissemination, \ncomputing, trading, and communication.    \n \uf402\n Active money managers need to seek easy games. These include competing against individuals, \ninvestors who buy and sell without regard for fundamental value, and investors who use simple decision \nrules. Wealth transfers are another potential source of excess returns.  \n \uf402\n Small and unsophisticated investors should build passive portfolios, with an emphasis on asset allocation \nand low cost. Sophisticated investors should seek active managers in asset classes with high dispersion. \nThere are ways to assess money managers beyond past performance that may shade the odds in your \nfavor. \n \uf402\n Active managers must constantly consider who is on the other side of the trade. Research shows that \nfundamental money managers who take a long view and are truly active can deliver excess returns. It is \nessential to identify a repeatable source of edge and to align the investment process to capture that edge. \n \uf402\n There is an academic case for indexing, which is based on the work by Nobel Laureates Harry Markowitz \nand William Sharpe. They developed a way to understand the trade-off between risk and reward and \nemphasized the importance of thinking about portfolios. Subsequent to their work, researchers identified \nfactors associated with returns beyond risk, measured as variance, which has led to factor investing \n(\u201csmart beta\u201d).   \n \n \n"

      "text": "January 4, 2017  \n \nLooking for Easy Games \n4 \nIntroduction \n \nSay that I invite you to my house for a game of poker on Friday night. If you play to make money, your first \nquestion should be, \u201cWho else will be there?\u201d If I tell you that some rich players who have poor skills will attend, \nyou will put the date on your calendar. If I say that the other players are better than you are, you will make \nalternative plans. \n \nLet\u2019s make this a little more interesting. Rather than providing you with an assessment of each player\u2019s skill, \nI\u2019ll tell you about some scenarios for the outcomes of the evening. I will invite 5 players, each of whom will \nbring $200.  \n \nIn the first scenario, I tell you that the expected winning of each player is zero. While money will move around \nbecause of normal variance, the players are anticipated to gain or lose nothing by the end of the night. \n \nIn the second scenario, I tell you that one player is expected to leave with the same $200 he or she walked in \nwith, two are expected to lose $100 each and thus depart with only $100, and the final pair is expected to \ngain from those losses and exit with $300. The standard deviation is $100.  \n \nIn the final scenario, one player is expected to leave with $200, two are going to lose all of their money, and \ntwo are going to take home $400. The standard deviation doubles to $200. \n \nHow much would you be willing to pay to access each scenario? \n \nIn the first case, the answer is nothing. In the second and third cases, your answer depends on an \nassessment of your skill. If you think you are one of the top two players, you should be willing to offer \nsomething less than your expected profits. If you think you are below the average, or do not know where you \nstand, you are better off not playing. \n \nAs simple as it is, our poker game reveals three important lessons for investors. First, for every winner there \nhas to be a loser. The money coming in the room at the beginning of the evening is the same as the money \ngoing out. Second, the players end up with less money than they started with if there is some cost to play. \nFinally, randomness ensures that some players will win or lose more than their underlying skill justifies. Skill is \nrevealed only over a large sample of games. \n \nOne of the biggest issues in the investment management industry today is the shift from active management, \nwhere a portfolio manager selects securities in an attempt to deliver higher returns than a benchmark index, to \npassive management, where a fund mirrors an index or operates according to set rules. Since the end of \n2006, investors have withdrawn nearly $1.2 trillion from actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds and have \nallocated roughly $1.4 trillion to U.S. equity index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Active management promotes price discovery. A market that \nis close to efficient, where prices accurately reflect available information, is a positive externality that benefits \nsociety.2 Think of the classic arbitrageur. He or she buys what\u2019s cheap, sells what\u2019s dear, and leaves efficient \nprices in the wake. Our arbitrageur enjoys an excess return and delivers a proper price. Markets must be \ninefficient enough to encourage active managers to participate. At the same time, the participation of active \nmanagers creates efficiency.3  \n \nIndex investors benefit from this externality. There is nothing wrong with that. We all benefit from prices every \nday. A corollary is that the market cannot be made up solely of passive investors: we need some investors to \ncollect information and to reflect it in prices.  \n \nActive investors also create liquidity in markets. Liquidity is the ability to turn assets into cash, and vice versa, \nin a timely fashion without suffering large transaction costs or a sizable price impact. Because buyers and \nsellers do not always seek to transact at the same time, investors have to compensate market makers to \ncreate a liquid market. Research shows that liquidity has an impact on asset prices, and assets with low \nliquidity are susceptible to large price reversals.4   \n \nThe questions relate to how many active investors we need to approximate this efficiency and how much our \nsociety should be willing to pay for price discovery and liquidity.5 \n \n \n \n-1,200\n-1,000\n-800\n-600\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n-1,200\n-1,000\n-800\n-600\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nBillions of U.S. Dollars\nBillions of U.S. Dollars\nIndex ETFs\nIndex mutual funds\nActively managed\nmutual funds\n"

      "text": "January 4, 2017  \n \nLooking for Easy Games \n6 \nIn 1991, William Sharpe, a professor of finance and winner of the Nobel Prize, described what he called \u201cthe \narithmetic of active management.\u201d6 He argued that the return on the average dollar managed actively will \nequal that of a dollar managed passively before costs, and that the return on the actively managed dollar will \nbe less than that of a passively managed dollar after costs.7  \n \nHere\u2019s the way to think about it. Say you define the market as the stocks that comprise the S&P 500. The \nindex and the passive funds that mirror it will generate the same return before costs. The return for the active \nmanagers must, then, also equal the S&P 500\u2019s returns as well because the parts, passive plus active, must \nequal the whole. Since the fees of 81 basis points for active funds, weighted by assets under management, \nexceed the 21 basis points that passive funds charge, active management will underperform the index as well \nas passive funds tracking the index over time.8  \n \nStudies going back as far as the 1930s have consistently shown that active managers generate net returns \nless than that of the market.9 Exhibit 2 shows that 42 percent of all U.S. equity funds outperformed the S&P \nComposite 1500 Index, on average, in each individual year from 2000-2015. This average rate of \noutperformance has a standard deviation of about 15 percent. It also shows that only about 1 in 8 funds \noutperformed the S&P Composite 1500 Index over the past 3 and 10 years, and only 1 in 20 did so for the \ntrailing 5 years. The percentage of outperformance varies by fund category, but most of the annual averages \nare in the range of 30-40 percent.       \n \nThe intuition behind these results is straightforward. If my 5 pokers players each walk in with $200 and agree \nto pay me to play, the net amount that walks out will be less than $1,000. The same math applies to passive \nfunds. Almost all passive funds underperform their relevant indexes after fees.10 For example, the compound \nannual total shareholder return for the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor (VFINX) shares was 17 basis points \nless than that of the S&P 500 Index, an amount comparable to the fund\u2019s fee, for the five years ended \nDecember 31, 2016. \n \n \n \n"

      "text": "January 4, 2017  \nLooking for Easy Games \n8 \nWhile passive investing makes a great deal of sense for most investors, it comes with potential negative \nexternalities. The overarching notion is crowding, a condition where investors do the same thing at the same \ntime without full consideration of the implications for future asset returns. We can separate the concerns \nabout crowding into asset mispricing and a reduction in liquidity. There is growing evidence that passive \ninvesting may lead to less efficient prices and an increase in market fragility associated with lower liquidity.11  \n \nIt is worth noting that crowding is a risk for active managers as well, especially those engaged in quantitative, \nrules-based strategies.12 In this case, a combination of leverage and an exogenous shock can lead to large \nmarket moves that are unrelated to changes in fundamental value. The massive losses that quantitative funds \nsuffered in August 2007 are an example of this phenomenon.13    \n  \nActive managers must believe in differential skill to justify their existence. Recall the poker metaphor. You \nwant to join the game only if you are more skilled than some of the other players and hence can expect to \ntake their money. In markets as in poker, excess gains and losses net to zero. For you to win, someone has to \nlose on the other side of the trade.  \n \nRichard Grinold, the former global director of research at Barclays Global Investors, defined \u201cthe fundamental \nlaw of active management\u201d more than 25 years ago.14  \n \n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc45= \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc36\u2217 \u221a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc45 \n \nIn words, the information ratio (IR), a measure of the return of a portfolio adjusted for risk, equals the \ninformation coefficient (IC), which measures skill through the average correlation between forecasts and \noutcomes, times the square root of breadth (BR), the number of independent opportunities for excess return \nthat are predicted to be available during some period of time.  \n \nIn plain language, it says that excess return equals skill times opportunity. You can apply the law to determine \nwhether you want to play poker at my house. Assume your skill is high. Scenario one has no excess return \nbecause all of the players are of similar skill. That means the breadth is zero and your expected excess gain is \nzero. On the other hand, scenario three is very attractive because you can employ your skill to earn an excess \nreturn at the expense of the weak players. \n \nA closer examination of the mutual fund industry shows the average active manager generates an excess \nreturn before fees, but the return is not enough to cover the costs.15 If active managers are winning before \nfees, who is losing?     \n \nFischer Black, a renowned economist, suggested the idea of \u201cnoise traders.\u201d16 He writes, \u201cPeople who trade \non noise are willing to trade even though from an objective point of view they would be better off not trading. \nPerhaps they think the noise they are trading on is information. Or perhaps they just like to trade.\u201d Noise \ntraders create profit opportunities for more skillful investors and supply markets with liquidity. But they can also \nslow the rate of price discovery and cause pricing distortions. \n \nThe percentage of equity ownership by individuals may be a good proxy for noise traders. Studies of results of \nindividual investors show that they lose to institutions because they succumb to a number of biases described \nin the behavioral finance literature.17    \n \nExhibit 3 tests this idea.

In particular, participation of \nrelatively unsophisticated investors in the dot-com boom and bust created the opportunity for substantial \nreturns for active managers. For example, in the two years ended March 2002, the S&P 500 Index was down \nmore than 20 percent while the average stock listed in the U.S. gained more than 20 percent.18 That\u2019s a good \nenvironment for stock picking.

Absolute skill has \nimproved in nearly all domains of human performance. This is readily evident in athletics, especially when \nresults are measured versus the clock. For example, on average elite athletes run and swim faster than ever \nbefore. The reasons for this improvement include a larger population of competitors, better training techniques, \nenhanced nutrition, and more refined coaching.   \n \nSkill in investing has followed the same course as sports. Today\u2019s professional investors are better trained, \nhave greater access to information, can rely on better theory, and have more computing power than their \npredecessors.

Said differently, a decline in \nrelative skill means the difference between the best and the average participant is less today than it was in the \npast. Stephen Jay Gould, a biologist at Harvard, made this point with batting average in Major League \nBaseball: while the mean batting average has remained relatively stable over time, the standard deviation has \nsteadily declined. The last player to sustain a batting average in excess of .400 for a full season did so in \n1941.  \n \nExhibit 4 extends the standard deviation of excess returns from exhibit 3 back to the early 1960s.21 The \nreduction is evident, with the notable deviation during the dot-com period. The results for hedge funds \ndemonstrate a similar pattern. This is the outcome you expect in a market that is largely efficient.    \n \nExhibit 4: Decline in Standard Deviation of Excess Returns for U.S. Large Capitalization Funds \n \nSource: Markov Processes International; Morningstar; Credit Suisse.  \n \nSecond, even if past performance provides evidence of differential skill, identifying which managers will be \nskillful in the future is a challenge.22 Persistence is one way to measure skill. Persistence measures the \ndegree to which outcomes are consistent over time. High persistence suggests skill. Low persistence \nindicates that luck is a substantial contributor to results.  \n \nExcess returns adjusted for risk have low persistence.23 This means that luck plays a substantial role and that \npredicting the future from the past is difficult. This is not because of a lack of skill. Rather, it reflects the \nuniformity of skill that is manifest in asset prices. We will explore some approaches to shade the odds in favor \nof the investor later in this report.   \n \nThe final reason it is hard for investors to benefit from skill is that the talented money managers capture most \nof the excess returns they generate. Jonathan Berk and Richard Green, professors of finance, created a \nmodel that helps to explain the phenomenon.24 They start with the assumption that there are skillful money \nmanagers and that investors and the managers can identify this skill.  \n \n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n1967\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\n2015\nStandard Deviation of Excess Returns\nNumber of funds\n69\n147\n207\n120\n353\n1,274\n1,082\n712\n1,236\n"

The skill of a manager of a \n$100 million fund that has a gross excess return of 100 basis points is $1 million (.01 * $100 million = $1 \nmillion), while the skill for the same excess return is $10 million for a $1 billion fund (.01 * $1 billion = $10 \nmillion). This idea is similar to economic profit, a measure of corporate performance. Skill measured this way is \npersistent.  \n \nBerk and Green share an example to make the idea more concrete. In his first five years running the Magellan \nFund at Fidelity, Peter Lynch had monthly gross alpha of 200 basis points on roughly $40 million of assets \nunder management. In his final five years, he had 20 basis points of monthly gross alpha on $10 billion of \nassets. So his value added went from $800,000 per month (.02 * $40 million = $800,000) to $20 million per \nmonth (.002 * $10 billion = $20 million). As Lynch\u2019s fund grew, his value added increased even as the gross \nalpha decreased.  \n \nFollow-up work by Berk and Jules van Binsbergen, also a professor of finance, found that the average value \nadded for a mutual fund was $3.2 million per year for the roughly 6,000 funds they analyzed from 1962 to \n2011, while the median value added was -$2.4 million. Most funds fail to create value, but skillful managers \ncontrol more assets than less skilled ones. That the average net alpha was essentially zero suggests that it is \nthe money managers, not the investors, who benefit from this skill.25  \n \nThe rational course for skillful managers is to increase their assets under management to the point where their \nexpected alpha approaches zero.26 As in other competitive labor markets, the portfolio manager captures most \nof the excess rents generated by his or her skill through higher compensation.27 A point of equilibrium exists \nwhere all managers have an identical expected return irrespective of their skill.  \n \nBefore we turn to the data, drivers, and opportunities, here is a summary of the discussion: \n \uf402\n Investors are shifting their investment allocations from active to passive management. This trend has \naccelerated in recent years. \n \uf402\n It is likely that the investors moving from active to passive are less informed than those who remain. This \nis equivalent to the weak players leaving the poker table. Since the winners need losers, this makes the \nmarket even more efficient, and hence less attractive, for those who remain. If you can\u2019t identify the \npatsy, or weak player, it\u2019s probably you.28 \n  \uf402\n Active management provides price discovery and liquidity. These are valuable social goods. However, the \nfees are higher for active managers than passive ones, identifying skill ahead of time is not easy, and \nthere is a cost to assessing skill. \n \uf402\n Passive management has lower costs than active management and hence delivers higher returns per \ndollar invested than active management does in the aggregate. Passive management introduces the \npossibility of crowding and illiquidity. \n \uf402\n How efficiently inefficient markets are determines the appropriate balance between active and passive. \nMore active management leads to more efficiency and an inducement to go passive. More passive and \nnoise investors create more inefficiency and hence opportunity for active managers.29 \n \uf402\n Active managers have to constantly ask, \u201cWho is on the other side?\u201d The unrelenting objective is to find \neasy games, where differential skill will pay off. \n \n"

Fundamental indexation strategies are also popular.33  \n \nThis research encouraged the financial innovation of \u201csmart beta,\u201d essentially portfolios built to reflect these \nfactors in the hope of delivering excess returns.

If excess returns in the U.S. equity markets are becoming scarcer, it stands to reason that \ninvestors should pay less to seek them. If nothing else, the shift from active to passive exerts downward \npressure on aggregate fees. Kenneth French, a professor of finance at the Tuck School of Business, \nunderscored the importance of fees in his presidential address to the American Finance Association in 2008. \nBy his calculations, the typical investor would have realized annual returns that were 67 basis points higher in \na passive portfolio than an active portfolio from 1980 through 2006. That return difference is largely explained \nby the higher fees that active managers charge.34     \n \nExhibit 12 shows the fees for active mutual funds, passive funds, and a blended average of the two from \n1990 through 2015. Fees for active funds remained relatively stable at around 80 basis points during this \nperiod. In the early years of the industry\u2019s growth, many mutual funds were offered with a \u201cfront-end load,\u201d an \nupfront cost. For example, an investor with $1,000 who bought a fund with a 5 percent front-end load would \npay $50, and $950 would be invested. Consideration of annuitized loads made the total cost of owning mutual \nfunds in excess of 200 basis points per year in 1980. Research shows that investors are attuned to this \nexplicit expense which explains the decline in load funds. However, they focused less on ongoing fund fees, \nallowing hot performing funds to attract flows irrespective of the underlying fees. Further, there remains \nsubstantial dispersion in fees, even for funds with similar objectives.35 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nPercent\n"

As the passive investment industry is dominated by a \nhandful of companies that can achieve economies of scale, the trend of lower fees is likely to continue. \n \nAs a consequence of the shift from active to passive investing, the average fees for all funds have declined \nfrom 81 basis points in 1990 to 59 basis points today. You can think of this as the cost that society pays for \nprice discovery and liquidity. \n \nFees for institutional investors are consistently lower than those for individuals.36 This is because institutions \nhave a higher percentage of their assets invested passively and because they can negotiate lower fees for the \nactive funds they do use. This discussion excludes alternative investments, although institutions can access \nthose investments at a lower cost than individuals can as well.  \n \nThe academic community continues to debate whether mutual fund fees are set competitively.37  Both the \nlowering of fees, especially if they start at the high-end of the industry range, and innovation in the form of \nnew products, contributes to market share gains for mutual fund families.38  \n \nWe can zoom in and take a look at which active funds are losing market share. One approach is to examine \nactive share, a measure of \u201cthe percentage of the fund\u2019s portfolio that differs from the fund\u2019s benchmark \nindex.\u201d39 Assuming no leverage or shorting, active share is 0 percent if the fund perfectly mimics the index and \n100 percent if the fund is totally different than the index.

These include regulation, the market environment, technology, and the balance of informed \nand uninformed investors. Each of these has also contributed in some degree to the shift from active to \npassive investment. We consider each. \n \nRegulation. Regulation has played a substantial role in the development of the mutual fund industry.45 Exhibit \n18 summarizes some of the key regulations and rulings since 1933 and provides a brief discussion of the \nsignificance for the industry. We segregate these regulations into three categories: those that protect \ninvestors, those that promote growth in the industry, and those that encourage investment in passive funds.   \n \nPrior to 1933, investors in stocks and funds were treated poorly by today\u2019s standards. Disclosure was meager, \ncosts were high, and agents commonly placed their interests ahead of those of the principals they served. The \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and, in particular, the Investment Company Act of 1940, addressed those \nissues. The Securities Exchange Act created the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) with the goal of \nprotecting investors. The Investment Company Act of 1940 dealt with specific prior abuses and stated  \nwhat the investment industry could and could not do.  \n \nFrom the time the 1940 Act passed to 1960, the assets under management for the mutual fund industry \nwent from $450 million to $17 billion, close to a 20 percent compound annual growth rate.46 This growth was \nthe result of good market gains, new entrants into the industry, and rising public confidence in mutual funds.     \n \n \n \n3.5\n3.6\n4.8\n6.9\n6.8\n6.9\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)\nVanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX)\nAmerican Funds The Growth Fund of America\n(AGTHX)\nAnnualized Returns, 10 Years Ending 2016 (Percent)\nTime-Weighted\nDollar-Weighted\n"

Koehn, The Economics of Mutual Fund Markets: Competition Versus Regulation (Norwell, MA: \nKluwer Academic Publishers, 1990); Investment Company Institute, 2016 Investment Company Fact Book. \n \nA second category of regulations and rules encouraged growth in the industry. These include the Revenue Act \nof 1936, a ruling by a district court in 1958, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, \nthe Revenue Act of 1978, and The Bearing of Distribution Expenses decision in 1980.  \n \nMutual funds were at risk of becoming nonviable as the result of tax law changes in the 1930s. One proposal \nhad the investment companies paying a tax once, and the shareholders a second time, on the dividends the \nfund received. The Revenue Act made a mutual fund exempt from taxation assuming it met certain criteria, \nallowing fund holders the same treatment as direct shareholders. \n \nIn 1958, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that an investment company could be sold. This \nwas over the objection of the SEC, which believed that such a transaction was a breach of fiduciary duty.47 \nThis opened the door for M&A and initial public offerings for investment management firms.  \n \nToday, of the 50 largest mutual fund management companies, 28 are owned by financial conglomerates, 11 \nare public companies, 10 are private companies, and 1 is a mutual.

      "text": "January 4, 2017  \nLooking for Easy Games \n24 \nWhile defined benefit programs were ERISA\u2019s main focus, the legislation paved the way for rapid growth in \nmutual funds in a few ways. ERISA tripled the allowable contributions into retirement plans (Keogh) for the \nself-employed where mutual funds were already strong, permitted investments in mutual funds for 403(b) \nplans which had been restricted to insurance company annuities, established individual retirement accounts \n(IRAs) for workers not covered by their employer\u2019s plan, and laid out the fiduciary standards for self-directed \nplans that invested in mutual funds.49      \n \nThe Revenue Act of 1978 sought to clarify some tax issues, but also created a large tailwind for mutual funds. \nDefined contribution plans could invest in mutual funds without worrying about fiduciary responsibility and an \nemployer would not be responsible for the employee\u2019s investment choices provided it offered a wide range of \nalternatives. Mutual funds also started to gain more awareness through stars such as Peter Lynch, and \nnewspapers started to quote prices daily. Add this to a bull market that emerged in the early 1980s and rapid \ngrowth ensued.  \n \nFinally, in October 1980 the SEC adopted rule 12b-1, which allowed mutual funds to pay for distribution. For \nexample, investment companies used 12b-1 fees to pay financial advisers to sell their funds. This, too, \naccelerated growth in assets under management.       \n \nThis set of regulations and rulings, when paired with the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s, led to \nextraordinary growth. Equity mutual funds in the U.S. had $54 billion in assets in 1982, the year the bull \nmarket started, and $3.9 trillion in 2000, the year the bull market ended.50 Nearly all of these assets were \nactively managed in 1982, and passive funds were only about 10 percent of the total in 2000.  \n \nThe final category of regulations has promoted the shift from active to passive funds. These include \nRegulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) implemented in 2000, the SEC\u2019s initiative to enhance mutual fund \nexpense and portfolio disclosure in 2004, and the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule, adopted in 2016.   \n \nWhile cheap access to information is desirable, regulators have focused in particular on uniform information \ndissemination. Reg FD, ratified in 2000, requires companies to disclose material information to all investors \nsimultaneously. Research shows that the returns for some large fund families suffered following the \nimplementation of the regulation, suggesting these investors did receive preferential treatment.51 This \ndegradation of results may have contributed to the migration from active to passive.   \n \nDisclosure is always high on the SEC\u2019s list of priorities, and in 2004 the commission pressed for greater \ndisclosure of holdings and fees. This transparency allowed mutual fund holders to more readily compare the \nexpense of their funds to less expensive passive alternatives. From 1990-1999, the S&P 500 had a \ncompound annual total shareholder return of 18.2 percent. There was little focus on fees. From 2000-2009 \nthe S&P 500\u2019s annual return was -1.0 percent, making the cost differential between active and passive even \nmore pronounced.   \n \nIn April 2016, the Department of Labor passed the fiduciary rule, which requires financial advisers to \nrecommend what is in the best interests of clients when they offer advice on retirement savings. This affects \nmore than $3 trillion in assets. Prior to the ruling, some investment advisors were held to a \u201csuitability \nstandard,\u201d which ensures only that an investment is suitable for the client. With the fiduciary rule, an advisor \nchoosing between two funds with similar characteristics will be pressed to select the less expensive one. This \nfavors passive investment. \n \n \n"

      "text": "January 4, 2017  \nLooking for Easy Games \n25 \nMarket Environment. Flows into passive funds and out of active funds have accelerated in the last 10-15 \nyears. We believe that this shift reflects, in part, the results for the stock market. Strong growth in active \nmanagement correlates with high returns in the market, and when markets are weak investors seek \nalternatives. Prime years for growth in active management included the 1940s-1950s and the 1980s-1990s. \nThe 1970s and the first 15 years of this century have presented a much larger challenge. \n \nThere is precedent for investors fleeing actively managed equity mutual funds following poor stock market \nresults. The 1970s are instructive. After strong years in 1971-72, assets under management for the U.S. \nequity mutual fund industry were $56 billion. Money market funds were not yet launched.  \n \nFollowing the sharp bear market of 1973-74, assets under management for equities dipped to $31 billion, \nwhile nascent money market funds reached $2 billion. By 1980, money market funds had $76 billion in assets \nand equity funds had only $44 billion.52 The yields on money market funds were attractive relative to the stock \nmarket, rising from the mid-single digits in the mid-1970s to low double-digits by 1980. The broader point is \nthat the market environment influences how investors allocate assets within their portfolios.    \n \nThe S&P 500 had a total shareholder return of 4.5 percent from the beginning of 2000 through the end of \n2016, with almost a quarter of those years having negative returns. Once again, investors sought to make \nchanges. Flows into bond funds have exceeded those of equity funds since 2000, and in the last decade \nactive funds have lost substantial assets to passive funds.  \n \nTechnology. Perhaps nothing has affected the investment landscape more than technology in the past half \ncentury. Specific drivers include advances in the speed and cost of information dissemination, computing, \ntrading, and communication. The advent of the Internet, in particular, has allowed the tools of investing to be \nshared with a larger population at a lower cost than ever before.    \n \nThere are a few requirements for a securities market to function well, including cheap and accurate \ninformation, uniform disclosure of that information, and secondary markets that have low costs and limited \nconstraints.53 Technology has allowed for progress across each of these requirements.   \n \nThe Internet, which diffused quickly across the population since its commercial introduction in the early 1990s, \nnow allows investors to obtain information at a very low cost. Access to company data, including regulatory \nfilings and stock quotes, was more time consuming and costlier prior to the advent of the Internet. Because of \nMoore\u2019s Law, which allowed for substantial performance improvement over time, the costs of computing, \ncommunication, and storage have all plummeted in recent decades.  \n \nOne particularly important consequence of this access is an improved ability to make comparisons. Investors \ncan now see the performance of their portfolio in real time, and can consider investment opportunities quickly \nand with little effort. For example, investors can now easily compare the expenses of two similar funds in order \nto make an informed decision.      \n \nFinally, it is clear that technology has dramatically lowered transaction costs. Prior to May 1, 1975, \ncommissions on stock purchases on U.S. exchanges were regulated and high. The first index fund (see \nappendix) was non-viable because of the cost of trading and administration. The transaction cost per share is \nmuch lower and bid-offer spreads are substantially smaller than in the past.54 Algorithmic trading, while \ncontroversial to some, has been shown to improve liquidity.55 These developments have allowed the index fund \nindustry to emerge and for the industry to charge progressively lower fees over time. \n \n"

      "text": "January 4, 2017  \nLooking for Easy Games \n26 \nThe combination of cheap computing power, lots of data, and low transaction costs has allowed quantitative \nfunds to emerge. Perhaps the best known of these is Renaissance Technologies.56 Many of these funds trade \nfrequently, aiding both price discovery and liquidity. For these active funds to win someone on the other side \nof the trade must lose.  \n \nThe main implication here is that computer programs, built by humans, may exceed human judgment in \ninvesting. David Siegel, founder of the quantitative fund, Two Sigma, recently said, \u201cEventually the time will \ncome that no human investment manager will be able to beat the computer.\u201d57 This presents a challenge for \ntraditional mutual funds. We believe that a combination of man and machine may be a viable alternative to \neither all fundamental or all quantitative approaches.58  \n \nActive managers have to consider people, process, and information in the search to gain edge.59  There has \nhistorically been a chasm between qualitative and quantitative investment approaches. The skills required to \nsucceed in the future are likely to be at an intersection of these approaches. Process relates to decision \nmaking. Technology allows for greater rigor in modeling corporate performance, simulation, and position sizing. \nFinally, edge is information. Translating data into information is a central challenge in investing.   \n \nThose active managers that cannot incorporate technology into their businesses will likely lose assets to \npassive strategies. Technology is a two-edged sword: it contributes to excess returns if used effectively but \nalso promotes disintermediation.   \n \nBalance of Informed and Uninformed Investors. The final driver of the shift from active to passive is at \nthe heart of this discussion. Our point of departure is a paper by two economists, Sanford Grossman and \nJoseph Stiglitz, called \u201cOn the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets.\u201d60 The paper was published in \n1980, which is noteworthy because the 1970s were probably the peak in enthusiasm for the efficient market \nhypothesis.61    \n \nTheir basic argument is that markets cannot be perfectly informationally efficient because there is a cost to \ngathering information and reflecting it in asset prices. Investors who absorb those costs should receive a \nproportionate benefit. That benefit comes in the form of excess returns as the result of inefficient prices.  \n \nThis leads to a paradox: the more individuals who are informed, the more efficient prices become, and the less \nvalue there is in being informed. Efficient prices lead investors to move from active to passive, which may \ncreate inefficiencies from which active managers can profit. So if everybody invests actively, you want to be \npassive. If everyone invests passively, you want to be active.

As a result, in \nrecent years the cost of active management outstripped the benefit in the Grossman-Stiglitz model.

The higher the fraction of the industry that is active, the lower the \nexpected return. They use the following equation to model decreasing returns to scale:  \n \n\ud835\udefc= \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc4f(\ud835\udc46/\ud835\udc4a) \n \nWhere \u03b1 is the industry\u2019s expected return in excess of passive benchmarks, a is the expected return on the \nfraction of wealth invested in active, net of costs, b captures decreasing returns to scale, and S/W is the \npercentage of the industry that is active.  \n \nExhibit 19 shows this tradeoff. In this simple model, we assumed a is 10 percent, b is 0.10 and S/W is 0.75, \nwhich means that 75 percent of the U.S. equity industry is managed actively. These are all close to what has \nbeen observed empirically. The central insight is that investors have to adopt a point of view on what values \nthe parameters will take to come up with the proper allocation between active and passive.    \n \nExhibit 19: A Model of Decreasing Returns to Industry Scale \n \nSource: \u0139ubo\u0161 P\u00e1stor and Robert F.

One way to address this question is to look at active management and indexing \nin markets around the world. Recent research concludes \u201cthat active funds perform better in markets in which \nlow-cost explicitly indexed funds are more available.\u201d64 The fact that competition drives down fees and compels \nactive managers to position their portfolios with higher active shares explains this result.  \n \nA problem remains, though, which goes right back to our poker game metaphor. Passive investors always \nearn the benchmark returns minus their small fees. For some active managers to win in the form of excess \nreturns, others must lose. This is implicit in the P\u00e1stor and Stambaugh model.65 Further, investors have to be \nable to find the skillful managers, and may incur costs doing so. \n0.00\n0.75\nExpected Return\nFraction of Industry Actively Managed\nAlpha \nafter fees\nAlpha \nbefore fees\nalpha before fees = expected return \u2013 (scale factor \u00d7 % actively managed)\n"

Markets are informationally \nefficient. No free lunch says that there are no investment strategies that can reliably earn excess returns after \nadjustment for risk. In other words, it is hard to beat the market.  \n \nIf prices are right, there is no free lunch. But just because there is no free lunch does not mean that prices are \nright. One of the main reasons for this is the limits of arbitrage. These limits include implementation costs and \nsubstitution risk. Prices can be wrong and it can still be hard to beat the benchmark. \n \nIt is also worth mentioning that Sharpe\u2019s fundamental law of active investing is not ironclad. This is because \nindex funds must trade in order to constantly mirror the index. Triggers for trading include share repurchases, \nseasoned equity offerings, and mergers and acquisitions. These trading costs can be as large as 20-30 basis \npoints for funds tracking the S&P 500 and 40-75 basis points for Russell 2000 index funds.74  \n \nSome of these costs are offset by activities such as securities lending.75 The point is that some active managers \ncan benefit at the expense of passive investors, although they must have a process that is organized to do so. \n \nActive investors must believe in price inefficiency and efficiency. Inefficiency allows the investor to buy something \nfor less than it is worth, or sell it for more than it is worth, and efficiency ensures that the security price moves \ntoward that fundamental value. The challenge is to find edge: be the smartest player at the poker table.  \n \nWe turn to the possible sources of excess returns for active investors. These include competing with \nindividuals, competing with investors who buy or sell without regard for fundamental value, and wealth \ntransfers within the market. These categories are not mutually exclusive, but provide a roadmap for \nconsidering who is on the other side.  \n \nCompeting Against Individuals. As indicated in the introduction, individual investors can be a good source of \nexcess returns for institutional investors. A survey of the behavior of individual investors noted that \u201cthe evidence \nindicates that the average individual investor underperforms the market\u2014both before and after fees.\u201d76  \n \nFor example, one study of all of the investors in Taiwan found that institutions earned abnormal excess returns \nof 1.5 percentage points while individuals lost 3.8 percentage points.77 The researchers posit that the \nindividuals are generally overconfident, causing them to trade too much.  \n \nInstitutions generally have better information and analytical skills than individuals do. For example, institutions tend \nto buy stocks from individuals in cases when the stock underreacts to good news about future cash flows. \nInstitutions outperform individuals by 1.4 percentage points in these cases.78 Further, initial public offerings (IPOs) \nwith greater participation by retail investors perform worse than those dominated by institutions.79    \n \nOne of the ways that academics can measure individual investor behavior is through mutual fund flows. \nResearch finds that individuals tend to buy mutual funds with \u201chigh sentiment,\u201d which correlates with prior \nstrong returns and high valuations for the underlying stocks. The managers of funds, in turn, tend to buy more \nshares of what they already own, bidding up the shares in the short run but leading to poor subsequent results. \nThe researchers call this the \u201cdumb money\u201d effect.80 The companies that these mutual funds own increase \ntheir issuance of equity via seasoned equity offerings and acquisitions financed with stock, suggesting the \ncompanies may be the winner in the exchange. \n"

This research also underscores the point \nthat fund inflows and outflows can complicate the assessment of mutual fund manager skill.83 \n \nWhile the dumb money exacerbates stock price return anomalies, fund flows to hedge funds attenuate them. \nResearchers call these flows \u201csmart money.\u201d84 These effects apply to stocks with high valuations. The case \nsuggests that hedge funds benefit at the expense of mutual funds, which are reacting as a result of the \nbehaviors of their investors. Hedge funds also take advantage of mutual funds by anticipating liquidations of \nmutual fund positions as the result of withdrawals by investors.85  \n \nCompeting Against Investors Who Buy or Sell Without Regard for Fundamental Value. Informed \ninvestors buy and sell based on mispricing that is either relative (arbitrage) or absolute (fundamental investing). \nHowever, some investors trade without regard for price or value, creating opportunity for other market \nparticipants.  \n \nOne example is a spin-off, where a company distributes shares of a wholly owned subsidiary to its \nshareholders on a pro-rata and tax-free basis. Joel Greenblatt, founder of Gotham Capital, suggests that \n\u201conce the spinoff\u2019s shares are distributed to the parent company\u2019s shareholders, they are typically sold \nimmediately without regard to price or fundamental value.\u201d86 Imagine that you run a sizeable mutual fund that \ninvests in large capitalization stocks. The shares of the spin-off you receive do not fit the fund\u2019s investment \nobjectives and are typically an inconsequential percentage of the portfolio. A quick sale makes sense.  \n \nSubstantial research shows that spin-offs create value for the spin-offs themselves as well as the corporate \nparents.87 Researchers who did a meta-analysis of more than 25 papers in the spin-off literature summed up \ntheir findings this way: \u201cThe main conclusion is consistent: spin-offs are associated with strongly significant \nabnormal returns.\u201d Researchers suggest the factors that explain these wealth effects include sharpened focus, \nbetter information, and in some cases tax treatment.88 \n \nAnother example is the value premium, the empirical finding that stocks that are statistically inexpensive \nmeasured by ratios such as price-to-book and price-to-earnings outperform the market. The question is \nwhether this premium is a product of risk or \u201cna\u00efve\u201d strategies followed by uninformed investors. While the \nissue remains open, the balance of the research suggests that a behavioral explanation best fits the facts.89 \nThe story is that uninformed investors extrapolate past earnings growth rates too far, overreact to positive or \nnegative news, and act as if recent price action will continue.     \n \nA final example is the leverage cycle.90 Developed by John Geanakoplos, an economist at Yale University, the \nleverage cycle focuses on the role of margin requirements. When times are good, say in the housing market, \nborrowers can access capital at attractive rates and with relatively high loan-to-value ratios. But when prices \nturn down, not only do loans become more expensive but the loan-to-value ratios drop. In other words, the \ninvestors must put up more capital. \n \nThe leverage cycle leads to unguarded optimism on the upside and devastating selling on the downside. \nSellers are forced to liquidate not only to cover the old margin requirements but also the new, more stringent \ndemands. The leverage cycle has both buyers and sellers transacting without regard for fundamental value. \nGeanakoplos recommends a mechanism to manage margin requirements to take out these highs and lows.    \n \n"

Informed investors calculate the present \nvalue of future cash flow in order to assess an asset\u2019s fundamental value. Uninformed investors use other \nstrategies, including the assumption that past price movement indicates the prospects for future returns.   \n \nEconomists have examined the impact these approaches have on asset pricing. In one laboratory experiment, \nthe researchers had long-term investors, who determined value by considering the present value of future \ndividends, and short-term investors who relied on price signals.91 They found that the long-term investors \nsettled on prices that were informationally efficient. The short-term investors, unable to assess value from \ndividends, were prone to bubbles and crashes. Markets are generally efficient when both groups trade, but the \nmarket becomes susceptible to distortion if the long-term investors bow out for any reason.    \n \nMarkets tend to be informationally efficient when investors use heterogeneous decision rules.92 This is the \nwisdom of crowds. The loss of diversity as the result of converging decision rules creates fragility in the market \nand the possibility of prices departing substantially from value. This is the madness of crowds. Diversity \nbreakdowns, which are the same as crowding, are bad for price efficiency and liquidity.    \n \nBlake LeBaron, an economist at Brandeis University, builds agent-based models to analyze asset pricing.93 \nOne version of his model has 1,000 investors (\u201cagents\u201d) who have portfolio objectives that are well defined. \nLeBaron gives the agents a menu of investment strategies that evolve over time. He then lets the agents \nloose in silico and observes the asset prices that result from their interaction. The model is simple but captures \nmany empirical features of markets, including fat-tails, persistence, and clustered volatility.  \n \nOne of the model\u2019s most important revelations is the relationship between the diversity of investment \nstrategies and asset prices. During certain periods, the diversity of investment strategies falls steadily even as \nthe asset price rises. Diversity reaches a low when the price is at a high. Then the asset price crashes.  \n \nLeBaron discusses how crashes happen:  \n \nDuring the run-up to a crash, population diversity falls. Agents begin to use very similar trading \nstrategies as their common good performance begins to self-reinforce. This makes the population very \nbrittle, in that a small reduction in the demand for shares could have a strong destabilizing impact on \nthe market. The economic mechanism here is clear. Traders have a hard time finding anyone to sell to \nin a falling market since everyone else is following very similar strategies. In the Walrasian setup used \nhere, this forces the price to drop by a large magnitude to clear the market. The population \nhomogeneity translates into a reduction in market liquidity. \n \nLeBaron\u2019s model provides two additional observations that are remarkable. The first is that the relationship \nbetween diversity loss and asset price changes is non-linear. The reduction of diversity, or crowdedness, \ndrives the asset price higher at first. But the price decline is sudden and sharp.  \n \nThe second is the link between diversity and liquidity. Lower diversity leads to less liquidity as the result of \ndemand pressure. This factor does not come into play for large capitalization stocks such as those in the S&P \n500. Indeed, inclusion into the S&P 500 tends to improve a stock\u2019s liquidity.94 But this factor is relevant for \nuninformed investors who pile into some ETFs, where trading costs can rise.95        \n \nThe rise of indexing has created distortions in the market. The evidence is mounting that passive investing has \nincreased the valuations of the stocks going into the index as well as the correlation of the constituent stocks.  \n \n"

Research shows that the rise in passive investing has led to prices that are less \ninformationally efficient. Companies that are added to the S&P 500, for instance, see their price-to-book and \nprice-to-earnings ratios increase immediately.96  \n \nActive funds tend to trade the same stocks as passive funds, but those stocks that are held more by passive \ninvestors are less informationally efficient than those that are held more by active investors. In mid-2016, \npassive index funds and ETFs owned 10 percent or more of 458 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500. In \n2005, that was true for only 2 of the 500.97   \n \nThe rise of passive investing has also led to an increase in correlation among the constituent stocks.98 From a \npractical point of view, this suggests that systematic market risk has risen and the ability to diversify has fallen. \nThis is relevant for both passive investors who base their allocations on past correlations as well as active \nmanagers who might see unanticipated behavior within their portfolios for wholly non-fundamental reasons.    \n \nFor active managers, this is where the distinction between \u201cprices are right\u201d and \u201cno free lunch\u201d can be \nfrustrating. Passive investing is creating distortion in asset prices. Prices are not right. The question is how to \ntake advantage of it. Note again that the index fund holders will always earn the index return, and that for \nevery active manager who wins there has to be one who loses. So no free lunch still seems to hold. \n \nThere are a few ways to benefit. First is to look for reversals in flows and act as a liquidity provider. This allows \nyou to buy low. Second, if possible, you can short large inflows and excessive valuations. This allows you to \nsell high. This is inherently very risky because of the limits of arbitrage and timing. Finally, you can \ncommunicate with the management team that has a stock that is over- or under-valued. Departures from fair \nvalue provide management teams with opportunities to create value for ongoing shareholders.  \n \nWealth Transfers. Corporations and investors make decisions that can lead to wealth transfers. Richard \nSloan and Haifeng You, professors of finance, estimate that these wealth transfers averaged 1.8 percent of \nmarket capitalization per firm-year from 1973 through 2008.99 The effect was particularly pronounced in the \nlate 1990s. Here we describe three such transfers. \n \nShare buybacks and dividends are equivalent in theory under certain conditions.100 In reality, these conditions \nare never met. The condition that the company repurchases shares at fair value is particularly nettlesome. In \nthe case that a company buys back stock that is either over- or under-valued, there is a wealth transfer. \n \nWe must underscore that there is a value conservation principle from the point of view of the company.101 If a \ncompany worth $1,000 chooses to pay out $200, the value of the firm is $800 following the disbursement no \nmatter what the form of payout. The wealth transfer occurs between the selling and ongoing shareholders.  \n \nThe basic rule is simple. If a company buys back overvalued stock, selling shareholders benefit at the expense \nof ongoing shareholders, and if it buys back undervalued stock, ongoing shareholders benefit at the expense \nof selling shareholders. The value of the firm does not change. The wealth transfer comes from the way the \nvalue is divvied up.  \n \nSimilarly, if the company sells overvalued stock, ongoing shareholders benefit at the expense of those \nacquiring the new shares. Selling undervalued stock hurts the ongoing holders and helps those who buy.  \n \nThe strategy here is to own shares of an undervalued company that is aggressively repurchasing shares.  \nThat said, Sloan and You find that overpricing leads to larger wealth transfers than underpricing.  \n \n"

      "text": "January 4, 2017  \nLooking for Easy Games \n34 \nAnother form of transfer is mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The goal of an acquirer is to pay no more than \nthe value of the target company\u2019s expected cash flows plus the present value of synergies. If an offer exceeds \nthat value, there is a wealth transfer from the shareholders of the acquiring company to the shareholders of \nthe selling company.  \n \nHere are some numbers to make the concept more concrete. Say the acquiring company has an equity \nmarket capitalization of $2,000 and finds a target that has a market value of $800 and estimates that the \nsynergy between the businesses is worth $200. The combined value of the firms is $3,000 assuming a deal. \nIf the acquirer bids $1,000, the selling shareholders make 25 percent and the buyers see no change in value. \nBut say the deal is contested and the price paid rises to $1,100. In that case, the seller is up 37.5 percent \nand the buying shareholders lose 5 percent. The value of the combined business is still $3,000, but now \nwealth is transferred.  \n \nThe empirical record shows that the combined value of the seller and buyer after a deal is announced is \ngenerally higher than the value before the deal. But it is common for more than 100 percent of the synergy \nvalue to go to the selling shareholders. The strategy here is to own shares of selling companies as well as the \nselect acquirers with a good long-term record of success.               \n \nThere is a general assumption that the return for all investors in aggregate equals the return of the market \nbecause for every buyer there is a seller. This is true for a closed system, but markets are not closed. Initial \npublic offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) are examples. \n \nThe story is straightforward: companies that issue equity tend to underperform the market subsequently.102 \nThis is true whether or not the issuance is part of the financing for an M&A deal. This is also true at the \nmarket level. Returns for the market tend to be relatively poor following lots of stock issuance.  \n \nAnother trend to watch is government intervention in equity markets. While researchers have documented and \ndebated central bank actions in the fixed income markets, some governments have become big shareholders. \nFor example, in Japan the central bank is a top-ten holder of about 30 percent of the companies in the top \nindexes, and in China a state-owned fund is a top-ten holder of about 40 percent of the listed companies.103     \n \nThe literature on wealth transfers complements the finding that dollar-weighted returns are less than time-\nweighted returns for investors.       \n \nRecommendations \n \nInvestors. Following the model by G\u00e2rleanu and Pedersen, we can now offer some recommendations for \ninvestors who seek satisfactory long-term results.   \n \uf402\n Don\u2019t Be the Patsy. Indexing makes a great deal of sense for investors who do not have the time or \nsophistication to evaluate investment managers. This is relevant for most individuals. These investors \nshould focus on allocating assets appropriately and minimizing costs. \n \uf402\n Seek Dispersion. Research shows that there is more opportunity for excess returns in asset classes \nwhere the dispersion of returns for asset managers is wide. Since markets demonstrate varying degrees \nof efficiency, it makes sense to consider the trade-off between active and passive case by case. \nInvestors should also be alert to the possibility of other costs and risks, including legal and political ones, \nfor apparently inefficient markets.    \n"

Academics suggest that careful examination of four factors allow for a \nbetter probability of identifying skillful active managers.104 The first is an examination of past performance \nfollowing some important adjustments for factors and random skewness in returns. Next, there is \nevidence that some managers do better in certain macroeconomic environments. Managers who are well \neducated, as evidenced by their college, SAT scores, graduate school or business school, and attainment \nof a chartered financial analyst credential, tend to outperform those who are less educated. Further, \nmanagers from poor families generate more alpha than those from rich families.105 Finally, analysis of \nfund holdings, which is difficult for unsophisticated investors to access, reveals that contrarian managers \noutperform managers who herd.106     \n \uf402\n Build Your Own Index. Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management, \nsuggests that we are on the cusp of developing indexes that capture a particular investment strategy.107 \nHe suggests that an index should be transparent, investable, and systematic. Ironically, the most popular \nindex in the world, the S&P 500 Index, does not embody the third property. Lo argues that sharp drops \nin the cost of structuring and trading securities introduces the possibility of customized indexes.   \n \nFundamental Asset Managers. The question any active fundamental investor must ask constantly is, \u201cWhat \nis my source of edge?\u201d An equivalent question is, \u201cWho is on the other side?\u201d108 Possible sources of edge \ninclude better information than the market, sharper analytical skills that allow you to better interpret data, a \ndifferent time horizon, and the liquidity to take the other side of investors making behavioral blunders. One \nprovocative idea is to start the investment process with a screen for potential inefficiency rather than, for \nexample, cheap stocks. \n \nEach source of edge requires a process that is congruent with the goals. A common mistake in the investment \nindustry is to engage in activities that do not effectively serve the objective of finding edge. \n \nIn markets around the world where explicit indexing is high, active managers tend to deliver greater alpha and \ncharge lower fees. Part of the explanation is a reduction in closet indexing, which has the returns of an index \nfund and the fees of an active manager. Active managers in these countries compete on differentiation and \nprice.109  \n \nHere are some potential ways that an active manager can remain relevant:   \n \uf402\n Be Active. The data show that passive investing is taking share from active funds that are closet \nindexers (see exhibit 14). Closet indexers have difficulty generating acceptable returns because they are \ncharging relatively high fees on a large percentage of the portfolio that simply mimics the benchmark. \nResearch shows that the best ideas within a portfolio generate excess returns.110 Notwithstanding their \ngenerally higher fees, the cost of the active component of many hedge funds is similar to that of mutual \nfunds.111 \n \uf402\n Be Long-Term Oriented. The advent of cheap computing and ample price data has led to analysis of \nprice action versus a calculation of fundamental value.112 Machines can beat humans at this game. This \ndoes raise the possibility that active investors can benefit from taking a longer-term point of view. Said \ndifferently, excess returns may be available in the short run through quantitative approaches but in the \nlong run through fundamental analysis. Indeed, funds with high active share and low turnover, implying a \nlong-term investment horizon, generate substantial excess returns.113 \n \n"

There are at least three ways that active fundamental managers can \nbenefit from quantitative methods. Active managers should understand how much of their performance \ncan be attributed to standard factors such as size and valuation. If investors can gain exposure to those \nfactors cheaply, they will not be inclined to pay active managers for the same exposure.  \n \nRecently, two finance professors, Kent Daniel and David Hirshleifer, have introduced both long- and \nshort-term behavioral factors which, when combined with a market factor, outperform other well-known \nfactor models.114 The long-term factor uses the external financing activities of firms and is based on \noverconfidence. The short-term factor is based on post-earnings announcement drift and captures \ninvestor inattention. These factors are useful for active managers who seek to buy cheap and sell dear \nbecause they capture mispricing rather than risk.   \n \nFinally, active managers can appeal to the base rates of corporate performance in order to find stocks \nthat reflect expectations that are too high or low. Incorporation of base rates into forecasts is known to \nbe helpful in decision making and provides important insight into the rate of regression toward the \nmean.115  \n \nSummary  \n \nThe debate over active versus passive investing can take tones of religious fervor. Investors are voting with \ntheir feet, creating $1.2 trillion of inflows for passive investments and $800 billion of outflows for active \ninvestments in the past decade. Whenever the market forms a strong consensus, caution is in order. \n \nActive managers provide the vital functions of price discovery and liquidity, but do so at a relatively high cost. \nAs a consequence, active managers do not generate excess returns after fees in the aggregate. Passive \ninvestments have much lower costs, but raise the possibility of crowding.  \n \nNot only can active and passive co-exist, they must. The reason is that there is a cost of gathering information \nand reflecting it in prices, and there needs to be an offsetting benefit in the form of excess returns to \ncompensate. Markets need to be efficiently inefficient. Passive investors, and indeed members of society, rely \non the price discovery that active managers deliver.    \n \nThe rise of passive investing may appear to make active management easier. But that is unlikely for two \nreasons. First, it is probable that the investors who are moving their funds to passive vehicles are relatively \nunsophisticated. That means that the average skill for the remaining active managers is rising, making it more \ndifficult to beat the market. Second, because alpha is a zero-sum game, fewer weak players means it is \nharder to find a corresponding loser if you intend to win.  \n \nSmall and unsophisticated investors should build passive portfolios with an emphasis on asset allocation and \nlow costs. Sophisticated investors should seek active managers in asset classes with high dispersion. There \nare ways to assess money managers beyond past performance that may shade the odds in your favor. \n \nActive managers must constantly consider who is on the other side of the trade. Research shows that \nfundamental money managers who take a long view and are truly active can deliver excess returns. It is \nessential to identify a repeatable source of edge, and to align the investment process to capture that edge. \n \n \n \n"

You cannot spend a dollar that you save today, but if you invest it \nsuccessfully you can spend more than a dollar tomorrow. Productive investments fund future liabilities such as \ncollege expenses and retirement income, or simply allow you to have more money to spend in the future. \n \nActive money managers seek to find investments that offer attractive rates of return relative to their perceived \nrisk. The global market for stocks and bonds is huge. The capitalization is roughly $67 trillion for the global \nstock market, $48 trillion for the corporate bond market (financial and non-financial), and $58 trillion for \ngovernment debt.116  \n \nEach of these markets pulsates with activity. For example, equity markets have constant news flow about \ncorporate results and prospects, new listings through initial public offerings and spin-offs, delistings as the \nresult of mergers and acquisitions and bankruptcy, and cash going back to shareholders through dividends \nand share buybacks. There are a lot of moving parts. The task of the active manager is to sift through this \ninformation and opportunity and select securities that will deliver good returns.  \n \nIn 1884, Charles Dow started an index to reflect the stock market\u2019s results. Dow selected 11 securities that \nhe felt would represent the market overall. Since then, hundreds of indexes have been established. Some of \nthe more prominent ones include the S&P 500 Dow Jones Index (U.S. equities), the Nikkei (Japanese \nequities), the Barclays Bond Index (U.S. corporate bonds), and the MSCI Global Index (global equities). Dow\u2019s \noriginal index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was eventually expanded to 30 stocks and still exists today. \nCommentators commonly use the Dow to summarize the market\u2019s results even though its practical relevance \nhas waned. Of the more comprehensive index of 12 stocks that Dow established in 1896, only General \nElectric remains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. \n \nFinance theory as we know it today was largely established in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1952, Harry \nMarkowitz, a graduate student at the University of Chicago studying operations research, suggested that the \noptimal portfolio is one that offered the highest expected return for a given level of risk, measured as the \nvariance of expected returns.117 Up to that point, investors thought a lot about returns but spent little time \nformalizing the notion of risk. Markowitz\u2019s mean-variance theory shifted the attention away from individual \nstocks toward a portfolio and made clear the benefit of diversification.   \n \nIn the early 1960s, William Sharpe, a professor of economics, defined the capital asset pricing model \n(CAPM).118 He identified a single factor, designated by the Greek letter beta (\u03b2), as a measure of a security\u2019s \nrisk relative to the market. More formally, beta measures the covariance between an asset and the market as \na whole. Use of beta allows for simpler portfolio construction. Adding stocks with high betas increases the risk \nof the portfolio, and adding those with low betas dampens risk.   \n \nMarkowitz\u2019s approach required calculating the covariance between all of the securities that an investor was \nconsidering including in a portfolio. In 1961, it took the best commercially available IBM computer more than a \nhalf hour to do that calculation for 100 securities. Sharpe\u2019s approach allowed for similar results with much less \ncomputational effort. Markowitz and Sharpe shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 \nfor their contributions.  \n \nSharpe proved one more thing. The market portfolio, the portfolio of all risky assets weighted by their market \ncapitalization, is where you get the best return for the risk you assume. The theories of Markowitz and Sharpe \nsuggest you want to own the market.  \n"

Wells Fargo established the first \nindex fund with a $6 million contribution from the pension fund of Samsonite, a luggage manufacturer. The \nfund owned the roughly 1,500 stocks that traded on the New York Stock Exchange in equal weights.119 \nBecause commission costs were high and fixed, the cost to administer and trade the fund made it difficult to \njustify. In 1973, Wells Fargo set up a fund to track the S&P 500 using money from its pension fund along \nwith the pension fund of Illinois Bell. In 1976, Samsonite consolidated its money into that fund as well.   \n \nIn August 1976, Jack Bogle, recently fired as the president of Wellington Management, a firm dedicated to \nactive management, launched the first true index fund. Encouraged by the academic literature, the Vanguard \nGroup sought to raise $150 million for its First Index Investment Trust but managed to collect only $11 \nmillion.120 Index funds were slow to gain popularity, reaching a level just above $500 million in 1985. But U.S. \nretail index funds grew to $48 billion by 1995, or about 4 percent of all assets under management in U.S \nequities, and reached nearly $1.5 trillion, or one-quarter of assets, in 2015.   \n \nThe CAPM also gained widespread use. For example, the CAPM is commonly employed to estimate the cost \nof capital and to assess the results of portfolio managers. But financial economists tested whether its most \nbasic prediction, that risk (\u03b2) and return are related, holds. They found that relative to the CAPM, stocks with \nlower risk earned higher returns than they were supposed to and that stocks with higher risk earned lower \nreturns.     \n \nStarting in the 1980s, researchers found that including other factors explained returns more effectively than \nthe CAPM alone.121 This was consistent with work by Stephen Ross on arbitrage theory that was published in \n1976. Ross\u2019s model allowed for multiple sources of systematic risk.122  \n \nIn 1992, a pair of finance professors, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, described a three-factor model that \nbetter explained returns than the CAPM by itself.123 The first factor is beta, but the others include size (small \ncapitalization stocks generate higher returns than large capitalization stocks) and value (cheap stocks \noutperform expensive ones). They later suggested that practitioners should not use the CAPM, writing, \n\u201cUnfortunately, the empirical record of the model is poor\u2014poor enough to invalidate the way it is used in \napplications.\u201d124 \n \nFinancial economists have identified other factors that explain returns, including momentum, profitability, and \ninvestment rate.125 Fama and French today advocate a five-factor model (CAPM, size, value, profitability, and \ninvestment patterns).126 Establishing these factors led the way to \u201csmart beta,\u201d which attempts to do better \nthan a traditional market-capitalization-weighted index by creating portfolios of stocks based on how they \nscore on these and other factors, rather than by simply their market capitalization.    \n \nOne crucial question is whether the excess returns these factors imply are the result of risk or behavioral \nmistakes by investors.127 If it is risk, the story is not very exciting because your returns are commensurate with \nthe risk you assume. The main contribution of the factor analysis is the proper identification of the risk factors. \nHence the name \u201csmart beta.\u201d \n \nThe story is much more interesting if the factors reflect behavioral mistakes because the returns are above \nand beyond what you would expect from the risk you have assumed. Some research suggests that the value \npremium, as an example, is the result of behavioral bias.128 If so, investors who capture the value premium by \navoiding bias may earn true excess returns. \n \n"

But if you had bet on that factor the moment that research was \npublished, you would have suffered nearly two decades of underperformance.130   \n \nAnother concern is whether the popularity of certain factors leads to returns that are a function of fund flows. \nIn other words, short-term excess returns are neither compensation for risk nor exploitation of behavioral \nmistakes, but rather are an unjustified increase in valuation that are prompted by the demand created by fund \nflows. If the driver of returns is the flow of funds rather than compensation for risk, a sharp performance \nreversal is a distinct possibility.131  \n \nAcademic research shows that it makes sense to invest in a diversified portfolio. Index funds provide a cheap \nway to do so. Further research has identified certain factors that explain returns better than the CAPM does, \nalthough there remains a debate as to whether those factors capture risk or behavioral mistakes. In either \ncase, there is an intellectual foundation that supports indexing, and it is a suitable strategy for most small and \nunsophisticated investors.  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n"
