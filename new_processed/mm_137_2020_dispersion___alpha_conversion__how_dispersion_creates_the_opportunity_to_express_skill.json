Skill can lead \nto success in academia, the arts, athletics, business, and politics. But \nfor skill to have a payoff, there has to be opportunity. The winning \nformula is the combination of skill and the ability to express it. \nRichard Grinold, who used to run research at Barclays Global \nInvestors, came up with \u201cthe fundamental law of active management\u201d \nin the late 1980s.1 The law is really an equation that says an investor\u2019s \nexcess return equals skill times opportunity. More formally, it is:     \nInformation Ratio = Information Coefficient \u2217 \u221a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\u210e \nInformation ratio (IR) measures the return of a portfolio adjusted for risk \nby dividing the portfolio\u2019s excess return versus a benchmark by the \ntracking error. The numerator reflects how well the fund does versus \nits benchmark and the denominator reveals how much risk the investor \ntook to attain those results. The IR is negative if a fund realizes returns \nless than its benchmark.2 \nInformation coefficient (IC) is the average correlation between \nforecasts and outcomes. A correlation near 1.0 indicates skill and \na correlation near zero reflects a lack of skill. In investing, skill is \nthe ability to buy or sell securities that generate excess returns and \nto allocate the proper amount of capital to those opportunities.   \nBreadth (BR) is the number of independent opportunities for \ninvestments that offer excess returns over a period. Breadth tends \nto be related to the dispersion of asset returns. This is intuitive. Say \nyou are an equity investor and your benchmark is the S&P 500. If \nthe returns of all the stocks in the index are similar, it is difficult to \ndistinguish yourself. If the returns are dispersed, you have the \nopportunity to generate high returns by owning the ones that go up \na lot and avoiding, or even shorting, the ones that go down a lot.   \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3028168 Exp. 04/30/2021 \n2 \n \nGrinold, along with his colleague Ronald Kahn, share an example of a roulette wheel to illustrate how the \nrelationship between the information coefficient and breadth leads to different information ratios.3 They assume \nthe roulette wheel has 18 red spots, 18 black spots, and 1 green spot. The ball has a 1-in-37, or 2.7 percent, \nprobability of landing on any individual spot. The green spot is the source of the casino\u2019s edge.   \nAssume a player bets $1 on red. The casino\u2019s information coefficient, or edge, is 2.7 percent (19/37 * 100% + \n18/37 * -100%). Since there is only one bet, the information ratio is 0.027 [0.027 (IR) = 0.027 (IC) *  \u221a1 (BR)]. \nThe IR is low because there is a lot of variance with one bet. \nCasinos make money based on a small edge spread over lots of bets. We now assume 1 million bets of $1 on \nred. The IC remains the same, 0.027, but the IR jumps to 27.027 because the square root of breadth is 1,000 \ntimes larger [27.027 (IR) = 0.027 (IC) *  \u221a1,000,000 (BR)]. The IR is high because there is little variance with one \nmillion bets.    \nYou can now see the relationship between skill and opportunity. You need a lot of skill to generate attractive \nexcess returns if the opportunity set is limited. You can have less skill and still achieve high returns if you have \na bountiful opportunity set. \nExhibit 1 shows the distribution of information ratios for nearly 1,900 U.S. equity mutual funds for the 3 years \nended March 31, 2020. The mean IR was -0.20, and the top quartile of funds had an average IR of 0.87. From \na practical point of view, a long-term IR of 0.10 is good and one of 0.50 or better is excellent.4 \nExhibit 1: Information Ratios for U.S. Mutual Funds (3 Years Ended March 31, 2020) \n \nSource: Morningstar Direct. \nNote: IR calculated on a geometric basis relative to a fund\u2019s primary prospectus benchmark. \nNote: The chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific \ninvestment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \nThis report delves into the topics of investment skill and opportunity set. The first point to make is that all the \nskill in the world is useless if there is no opportunity. There are a few ways this can happen. First, a skillful \nparticipant does not get to play the game. For example, a star athlete might have the ability to influence the \noutcome of a game but she cannot get in to play. In markets, this can be the result of capital or other constraints.5  \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n<(1.75)\n(1.75)-(1.50)\n(1.50)-(1.25)\n(1.25)-(1.0)\n(1.0)-(0.75)\n(0.75)-(0.5)\n(0.5)-(0.25)\n(0.25)-0\n0-0.25\n0.25-0.50\n0.50-0.75\n0.75-1.0\n1.0-1.25\n1.25-1.50\n>1.50\nFrequency\nInformation Ratio\nCount\n1,880\nMedian\n-0.23\nAverage\n-0.20\nStandard Deviation\n0.82\n"

Finance professionals call these arbitrage costs, and they include \naspects of executing a strategy such as finding and confirming mispricing, executing trades, and financing and \nfunding securities.6 In these cases, the opportunity is clear but the cost to play prohibits substantial excess \nreturns. \nFinally, skill is obscured if the opportunity does not offer differentiated payoffs. We call this \u201cthe paradox of skill.\u201d7 \nIn this case, skill is high but uniform among competitors. Imagine two tennis players of excellent but identical \nskill. The outcomes of their matches will appear to be random even though they are highly-skilled players. This \nis what happens in an efficient market: the ability of investors to gather, process, and reflect information means \nthat security prices accurately reflect expected values. \nMarkets are not perfectly efficient, and there is a great deal of variance in the skill of investors and the opportunity \nset the market presents. We now take a closer look at skill and opportunity set. Two essential themes for \ninvestors come out of the discussion. First, it is crucial to think about your source of edge and to align your \norganization\u2019s process to serve that end. Second, a big part of winning is finding a game that allows you to show \nyour skill. We\u2019ll review some ways to think about that. \nInvestment Management Skill      \nInvestors can express skill in three ways: market timing, security selection, and position sizing. Market timing \nmeans buying or selling asset classes in anticipation of favorable price changes. In other words, the capability \nto buy low and sell high. The evidence suggests that most investors are not skillful at timing the market.8   \nSecurity selection reflects an ability to find securities that realize returns in excess of a benchmark after adjusting \nfor risk. One way to measure security selection is through a measure called \u201cbatting average\u201d or \u201chit ratio.\u201d \nBatting average is the number of investments that make money as a percentage of total investments made. For \ninstance, if an investor makes 100 decisions in a year and 60 make money, the batting average is 60 percent.  \nPosition sizing, a feature of portfolio construction, measures the proficiency to make each investment the \nappropriate size to earn the highest return possible for an assumed level of risk. For example, the Kelly Criterion \nis a sizing algorithm that relates the size of edge for an opportunity to the amount of your bankroll you should \nallocate to that opportunity.9  \nYou can track sizing through \u201cslugging ratio\u201d or \u201cwin/loss rate.\u201d This measures the average gains for the \nsuccessful investments divided by the average losses for the unsuccessful ones.  \nRonald Van Loon, a fixed income portfolio manager at BlackRock in London, disaggregates the information \ncoefficient into terms that reflect batting average and slugging ratio.10 Specifically, he finds that when breadth is \nsufficiently large:11  \nInformation coefficient = 1.6[Batting average \u2013 1/(1 + slugging ratio)] \nThis is important because it allows you to consider the combinations of batting average and slugging ratio that \ngenerate attractive information ratios. Exhibit 2 shows the IRs that are the result of various combinations of \nbatting average and slugging ratio assuming that breadth is 50. One of the crucial observations is that an investor \ncan be correct much less than half of the time and still deliver a high IR if the slugging ratio is sufficiently high. \nIt\u2019s not how often you are right that matters, it\u2019s how much money you make when you\u2019re right versus how much \nmoney you lose when you\u2019re wrong. \n"

Van Loon, \u201cTiming versus Sizing Skill in the Investment Process,\u201d Journal of Portfolio \nManagement, Vol. 44, No. 3, Winter 2018, 25-32. \nNote: Breadth equals 50. \nNote: The chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific \ninvestment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \nTo illustrate the point, let\u2019s look at an IR of 0.3. A portfolio manager can achieve that with an 80 percent batting \naverage and a 0.3 slugging ratio or a 30 percent batting average and a 2.6 slugging ratio. In fact, the positive \nIRs highlighted in tan in exhibit 2 include those where the batting average is below 50 percent. The managers \nof these portfolios are wrong more often than they are right, but they make a lot of money when they are right. \nThis is where investment process becomes crucial. You can imagine very different paths to success. Scott \nBessent is the former chief investment officer (CIO) of Soros Fund Management and is now the chief executive \nofficer and CIO of Key Square Group, an investment partnership he founded. In an interview years ago, Bessent \ncommented about George Soros and Warren Buffett, two of the greatest investors in the past half century: \n\u201cGeorge Soros . . . is the opposite of Warren Buffett. Buffett has a high batting average. George has a \nterrible batting average\u2014it\u2019s below 50 percent and possibly even below 30 percent\u2014but when he wins \nit\u2019s a grand slam. He\u2019s like Babe Ruth in that respect. George used to say, \u2018If you\u2019re right in a position, \nyou can never be big enough.\u2019\u201d12 \nYou can think of this as the difference between riding and exploiting emotion. Momentum investors, and trend \nfollowers in particular, cut losses and let their winners run. They don\u2019t worry much about gaps between price \nand value.13 Bessent tells a wonderful story about being at a golf school in Florida with John Meriwether, founder \n####\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n50%\n55%\n60%\n65%\n70%\n75%\n80%\n85%\n90%\n95% 100%\n0.0\n-11.3 -10.7 -10.2\n-9.6\n-9.1\n-8.5\n-7.9\n-7.4\n-6.8\n-6.2\n-5.7\n-5.1\n-4.5\n-4.0\n-3.4\n-2.8\n-2.3\n-1.7\n-1.1\n-0.6\n0.0\n0.1\n-10.3\n-9.7\n-9.2\n-8.6\n-8.0\n-7.5\n-6.9\n-6.3\n-5.8\n-5.2\n-4.6\n-4.1\n-3.5\n-2.9\n-2.4\n-1.8\n-1.2\n-0.7\n-0.1\n0.5\n1.0\n0.2\n-9.4\n-8.9\n-8.3\n-7.7\n-7.2\n-6.6\n-6.0\n-5.5\n-4.9\n-4.3\n-3.8\n-3.2\n-2.6\n-2.1\n-1.5\n-0.9\n-0.4\n0.2\n0.8\n1.3\n1.9\n0.3\n-8.7\n-8.1\n-7.6\n-7.0\n-6.4\n-5.9\n-5.3\n-4.7\n-4.2\n-3.6\n-3.0\n-2.5\n-1.9\n-1.3\n-0.8\n-0.2\n0.3\n0.9\n1.5\n2.0\n2.6\n0.4\n-8.1\n-7.5\n-6.9\n-6.4\n-5.8\n-5.3\n-4.7\n-4.1\n-3.6\n-3.0\n-2.4\n-1.9\n-1.3\n-0.7\n-0.2\n0.4\n1.0\n1.5\n2.1\n2.7\n3.2\n0.5\n-7.5\n-7.0\n-6.4\n-5.8\n-5.3\n-4.7\n-4.1\n-3.6\n-3.0\n-2.5\n-1.9\n-1.3\n-0.8\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.9\n1.5\n2.1\n2.6\n3.2\n3.8\n0.6\n-7.1\n-6.5\n-5.9\n-5.4\n-4.8\n-4.2\n-3.7\n-3.1\n-2.5\n-2.0\n-1.4\n-0.8\n-0.3\n0.3\n0.8\n1.4\n2.0\n2.5\n3.1\n3.7\n4.2\n0.7\n-6.7\n-6.1\n-5.5\n-5.0\n-4.4\n-3.8\n-3.3\n-2.7\n-2.1\n-1.6\n-1.0\n-0.4\n0.1\n0.7\n1.3\n1.8\n2.4\n3.0\n3.5\n4.1\n4.7\n0.8\n-6.3\n-5.7\n-5.2\n-4.6\n-4.0\n-3.5\n-2.9\n-2.3\n-1.8\n-1.2\n-0.6\n-0.1\n0.5\n1.1\n1.6\n2.2\n2.8\n3.3\n3.9\n4.5\n5.0\n0.9\n-6.0\n-5.4\n-4.8\n-4.3\n-3.7\n-3.1\n-2.6\n-2.0\n-1.4\n-0.9\n-0.3\n0.3\n0.8\n1.4\n2.0\n2.5\n3.1\n3.7\n4.2\n4.8\n5.4\n1.0\n-5.7\n-5.1\n-4.5\n-4.0\n-3.4\n-2.8\n-2.3\n-1.7\n-1.1\n-0.6\n0.0\n0.6\n1.1\n1.7\n2.3\n2.8\n3.4\n4.0\n4.5\n5.1\n5.7\n1.1\n-5.4\n-4.8\n-4.3\n-3.7\n-3.1\n-2.6\n-2.0\n-1.4\n-0.9\n-0.3\n0.3\n0.8\n1.4\n2.0\n2.5\n3.1\n3.7\n4.2\n4.8\n5.4\n5.9\n1.2\n-5.1\n-4.6\n-4.0\n-3.4\n-2.9\n-2.3\n-1.7\n-1.2\n-0.6\n-0.1\n0.5\n1.1\n1.6\n2.2\n2.8\n3.3\n3.9\n4.5\n5.0\n5.6\n6.2\n1.3\n-4.9\n-4.4\n-3.8\n-3.2\n-2.7\n-2.1\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.4\n0.2\n0.7\n1.3\n1.9\n2.4\n3.0\n3.6\n4.1\n4.7\n5.3\n5.8\n6.4\n1.4\n-4.7\n-4.1\n-3.6\n-3.0\n-2.5\n-1.9\n-1.3\n-0.8\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.9\n1.5\n2.1\n2.6\n3.2\n3.8\n4.3\n4.9\n5.5\n6.0\n6.6\n1.5\n-4.5\n-4.0\n-3.4\n-2.8\n-2.3\n-1.7\n-1.1\n-0.6\n0.0\n0.6\n1.1\n1.7\n2.3\n2.8\n3.4\n4.0\n4.5\n5.1\n5.7\n6.2\n6.8\n1.6\n-4.4\n-3.8\n-3.2\n-2.7\n-2.1\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.4\n0.2\n0.7\n1.3\n1.9\n2.4\n3.0\n3.6\n4.1\n4.7\n5.3\n5.8\n6.4\n7.0\n1.7\n-4.2\n-3.6\n-3.1\n-2.5\n-1.9\n-1.4\n-0.8\n-0.2\n0.3\n0.9\n1.5\n2.0\n2.6\n3.2\n3.7\n4.3\n4.9\n5.4\n6.0\n6.6\n7.1\n1.8\n-4.0\n-3.5\n-2.9\n-2.3\n-1.8\n-1.2\n-0.6\n-0.1\n0.5\n1.1\n1.6\n2.2\n2.7\n3.3\n3.9\n4.4\n5.0\n5.6\n6.1\n6.7\n7.3\n1.9\n-3.9\n-3.3\n-2.8\n-2.2\n-1.6\n-1.1\n-0.5\n0.1\n0.6\n1.2\n1.8\n2.3\n2.9\n3.5\n4.0\n4.6\n5.1\n5.7\n6.3\n6.8\n7.4\n2.0\n-3.8\n-3.2\n-2.6\n-2.1\n-1.5\n-0.9\n-0.4\n0.2\n0.8\n1.3\n1.9\n2.5\n3.0\n3.6\n4.1\n4.7\n5.3\n5.8\n6.4\n7.0\n7.5\n2.1\n-3.6\n-3.1\n-2.5\n-2.0\n-1.4\n-0.8\n-0.3\n0.3\n0.9\n1.4\n2.0\n2.6\n3.1\n3.7\n4.3\n4.8\n5.4\n6.0\n6.5\n7.1\n7.7\n2.2\n-3.5\n-3.0\n-2.4\n-1.8\n-1.3\n-0.7\n-0.1\n0.4\n1.0\n1.6\n2.1\n2.7\n3.3\n3.8\n4.4\n4.9\n5.5\n6.1\n6.6\n7.2\n7.8\n2.3\n-3.4\n-2.9\n-2.3\n-1.7\n-1.2\n-0.6\n0.0\n0.5\n1.1\n1.7\n2.2\n2.8\n3.4\n3.9\n4.5\n5.1\n5.6\n6.2\n6.8\n7.3\n7.9\n2.4\n-3.3\n-2.8\n-2.2\n-1.6\n-1.1\n-0.5\n0.1\n0.6\n1.2\n1.8\n2.3\n2.9\n3.5\n4.0\n4.6\n5.2\n5.7\n6.3\n6.9\n7.4\n8.0\n2.5\n-3.2\n-2.7\n-2.1\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.4\n0.2\n0.7\n1.3\n1.9\n2.4\n3.0\n3.6\n4.1\n4.7\n5.3\n5.8\n6.4\n6.9\n7.5\n8.1\n2.6\n-3.1\n-2.6\n-2.0\n-1.4\n-0.9\n-0.3\n0.3\n0.8\n1.4\n1.9\n2.5\n3.1\n3.6\n4.2\n4.8\n5.3\n5.9\n6.5\n7.0\n7.6\n8.2\n2.7\n-3.1\n-2.5\n-1.9\n-1.4\n-0.8\n-0.2\n0.3\n0.9\n1.5\n2.0\n2.6\n3.2\n3.7\n4.3\n4.9\n5.4\n6.0\n6.6\n7.1\n7.7\n8.3\n2.8\n-3.0\n-2.4\n-1.8\n-1.3\n-0.7\n-0.1\n0.4\n1.0\n1.5\n2.1\n2.7\n3.2\n3.8\n4.4\n4.9\n5.5\n6.1\n6.6\n7.2\n7.8\n8.3\n2.9\n-2.9\n-2.3\n-1.8\n-1.2\n-0.6\n-0.1\n0.5\n1.1\n1.6\n2.2\n2.8\n3.3\n3.9\n4.5\n5.0\n5.6\n6.2\n6.7\n7.3\n7.8\n8.4\n3.0\n-2.8\n-2.3\n-1.7\n-1.1\n-0.6\n0.0\n0.6\n1.1\n1.7\n2.3\n2.8\n3.4\n4.0\n4.5\n5.1\n5.7\n6.2\n6.8\n7.4\n7.9\n8.5\nBatting Average\nSlugging Ratio\n"

In our case, when a stock drops and we believe in the fundamentals, the \ncase for future returns goes up.\u201d15  \nMomentum and value investors have opposite reactions to securities that fall and rise. When down, momentum \ninvestors sell and value investors buy. When up, momentum investors hold (or buy) and value investors sell. \nThe Medallion Fund run by Renaissance Technologies, perhaps the most successful hedge fund ever, relies on \nmodest skill and lots of breadth. Renaissance recognized early on that the fund could do very well if it had a \nbatting average just over 50 percent, a slugging ratio slightly higher than 1.0, and lots of trading opportunities. \nThe mathematician Elwyn Berlekamp, one of the early contributors to Renaissance, put it this way: \u201cIf you trade \na lot, you only need to be right 51 percent of the time. We need a smaller edge on each trade.\u201d16  \nCareful consideration of the fundamental law of active management provides some guidance for how to shape \nyour investment process and allocate resources. Venture capital can thrive with a low batting average and \nbreadth and a high slugging ratio. High-frequency traders need to make a small sum on a modest majority of \nnumerous trades. Exhibit 3 offers guidelines for the parameters in the fundamental law of active management. \nExhibit 3: Information Ratio Tradeoffs for Various Investment Strategies \nStrategy \nBatting Average \nSlugging Ratio \nBreadth \nVenture capital \nLow (< 50%) \nHigh (>2.5) \nLow \nBuyouts \nHigh (> 70%) \nMedium (>1.5) \nLow \nConcentrated equity \nHigh (> 70%) \nMedium (>1.5) \nLow \nRussell 1000 \nMedium (~ 50%) \nMedium (>1.5) \nMedium \nDiversified momentum  \nLow (< 50%) \nHigh (>2.5) \nMedium \nHigh frequency  \nMedium (~ 50%) \nLow (>1.0) \nHigh \nSource: Counterpoint Global; Gregory Brown, Robert S.

There is a natural connection between the ability \nto generate excess returns and dispersion. Generating a return in excess of that of the benchmark is really hard \nif the gains or losses in the underlying stocks are all very similar to those of the benchmark. The homogeneous \nperformance of the stocks that comprise the benchmark make it hard to deliver distinctive results. \nOn the other hand, there is a bountiful opportunity to pick the winners, avoid the losers, and create a portfolio \nthat meaningfully beats the benchmark if the dispersion of the constituent stocks is high. Research shows that \ndispersion is a reasonable proxy for breadth and that the results for skillful mutual fund managers are better \nwhen dispersion is high.19  \nExhibit 4 shows that the gap in excess returns between the best and worst mutual funds grows with higher \ndispersion. High dispersion allows the skillful managers to express their ability and distinguish themselves from \nthe pack.20   \nExhibit 4: Higher Dispersion Allows for Enhanced Expression of Skill \n \nSource: Larry R.

The alphas for a large \nnumber of funds generally follow a bell-shaped, or normal, distribution with a mean close to zero before fees. \nWinners and losers largely offset one another relative to the benchmark.  \nThe width of the normal distribution matters. When the distribution is wide, there is a lot of positive and negative \nalpha. That\u2019s good news if you are skillful, because it\u2019s easy to find a loser that allows you to win. When the \ndistribution is narrow, there is not a lot of positive alpha, and it\u2019s hard to separate the skilled from the unskilled. \nExhibit 6 shows the relationship between annual dispersion and standard deviation of alpha, a measure of the \nwidth of the distribution of alpha.

One approach begins by calculating the median return for the stocks within the \nindex for a particular year.23 That number was 29.2 percent in 2019 for the Russell 1000, which roughly reflects \nthe top thousand stocks in the U.S. based on market capitalization. Next, you determine the average total \nshareholder returns (TSR) for the stocks in the top half, which was 52.2 percent, and the average return for the \nbottom half, which was 8.5 percent. Dispersion is the difference between the two, or 43.7 percentage points \n(52.2 minus 8.5). Dispersion and the standard deviation of returns for an index are highly correlated.   \nExhibit 7 shows the dispersion of annual returns for the Russell 1000 from 1985-2020. Over that time, the lowest \ndispersion was 35.1 percent in 1994, the highest was 127.9 percent in 1999, and the average was 51.8 percent. \nExhibit 7: Dispersion of Returns for the Russell 1000, 1985-2020 \n  \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Figure for 2020 is annualized using year-to-date data through March 31. \nNote: Forecasts and/or estimates provided herein are subject to change and may not actually come to pass. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nStandard Deviation of Alpha (Percent)\nDispersion (Percentage Points)\nr = 0.78\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\nPercentage Points\n"

Figuring out which stocks will outperform boosts \nbatting average. Figuring out which stocks among those that will do the best, and sizing them appropriately, \nincreases the slugging ratio. We can measure this through dispersion of dispersion.     \nIn effect, what we are measuring is the ability to identify the best of the best and the worst of the worst. To do \nthis, we examine the average returns for the stocks in the highest quartile of returns and subtract the returns for \nthe stocks in the second-highest quartile. It is the top half of the outperformers minus the bottom half of the \noutperformers. In 2019, the top half of the outperformers in the Russell 1000 were up 67.5 percent, and the \nbottom half of the outperformers were up 36.9 percent. The dispersion of dispersion for the winners was 30.7 \npercent (see left panel of exhibit 8).  \nExhibit 8: Dispersion of Dispersion for the Russell 1000, 1985-2020 \n \n \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Figure for 2020 is annualized using year-to-date data through March 31. \nNote: Forecasts and/or estimates provided herein are subject to change and may not actually come to pass. \nLikewise, we can do the exercise for the underperformers.

The dispersion of dispersion \nfor the losers was 26.3 percent (see right panel of exhibit 8).   \nWe maintained the same scale for the vertical axis for the dispersion of dispersion of outperformers and \nunderperformers to show that the figure is on average much higher for the outperformers than for the \nunderperformers.

By the same \ntoken, investing in sectors with high dispersion provides the prospect of distinctive results. Exhibit 9 shows the \naverage annual dispersion of sectors from 1985 through 2019. Consistent with common sense, the technology \nand health care sectors provide higher average dispersions than do consumer staples and utilities. Further, \nwhile sectors such as financials and staples have similar average dispersions, the difference between the 75th \nand 25th percentiles of results is much larger for financials than for staples.  \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nPercentage Points\nOutperformers:\nTop Half Minus Bottom Half\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nPercentage Points\nUnderperformers:\nTop Half Minus Bottom Half\n"

We have focused on annual \ndispersion figures because that time frame most closely matches the average holding period of an equity mutual \nfund. We now turn to how to use these components to understand past results.   \nPractical Applications for Active Managers \nThere are four diagnostic steps that can help decompose performance into the elements of security selection, \nposition sizing, and opportunity set.24 While not precise, these steps will prompt introspection and potentially \nlead to shifts in emphasis within the investment process.25 Here are the steps: \n1. Security selection. Examine the securities in the portfolio at the beginning of a given period, generally \none quarter or one year, and build a portfolio with each security having the same weight. You can then \nmeasure batting average, or what percent made money relative to the total number of securities, and you \ncan calculate the return of the portfolio. You can then compare the equal-weighted portfolio to the returns \nfor an appropriate benchmark. \n2. Position sizing. The next step is to take the same securities at their weights in the portfolio and evaluate \nthe portfolio, with no adjustments, through the end of the measurement period. You can then compare this \ndo-nothing portfolio with actual initial weights to a do-nothing portfolio with equal weights. Most portfolio \nmanagers attempt to take larger positions in securities they expect to have higher returns and where they \nhave strong conviction in the thesis. This calculation will indicate whether you sized effectively versus \nhaving equal weights. The result also sheds light on slugging ratio. \n3. Portfolio activity. The following step is to compare the returns of the do-nothing portfolio with actual initial \nweights to the portfolio\u2019s actual returns, which will include all decisions to buy and sell securities during \nthe period. You can then further examine the impact of buying and selling as separate decisions.  \n4. Opportunity set. Finally, you can measure the dispersion of the sectors or industries in which you were \nactive. This measures whether you were operating where the opportunity is attractive, a prerequisite to \nthe ability to express skill. For example, a portfolio manager who has the S&P 500 as a benchmark can \nmonitor dispersion by sector and be more active in high-dispersion sectors and neutral in low dispersion \nsectors. The goal is to fish in the pond where there are plenty of fish. \nSummary \nThis report addressed the relationship between skill and opportunity set in assessing investment returns. The \nfirst point is that there must be a chance to express skill. Even the most talented will not fare well if they have \nno occasion to do so. \nInvestment skill boils down to security selection and position sizing. Security selection is what you bet on, and \nposition sizing is how much you bet on each security. We measured these through batting average, or what \npercentage of your total security transactions went up, and slugging ratio, or how much you made when you \nwere right versus how much you lost when you were wrong. We pointed out that there are lots of ways to get to \nattractive outcomes, including low batting averages and high slugging ratios.  \nBut no matter how you seek to generate excess returns, it is vital that you have a roadmap to those returns and \nthat your process is congruent with that objective.  \n"

Portfolios are subject to market risk, \nwhich is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value \nof Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing \nin this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities \nsecurities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets \nentail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in \nemerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. \nPrivately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly \navailable information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell \nthem (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant \nimpact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market \nrisks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). \n \nDISTRIBUTION \nThis communication is only intended for and will only be distributed to persons resident in jurisdictions where \nsuch distribution or availability would not be contrary to local laws or regulations. \nIreland: Morgan Stanley Investment Management (Ireland) Limited.
