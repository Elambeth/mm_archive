In one corner, the\nfinance professors\u2014 the proponents of stock market efficiency\u2014 argue that inves-\ntors cannot outperform the market over time. In the opposing corner, the practitio-\nners maintain that the market\u2019s gyrations defy the ivory tower logic of academia.\nThe battle armor for the professors: rational agents, random walk, and the efficient\nmarket hypothesis. Their \u201cproof\u201d includes the general failure of the chartists and\nthe fact that most money managers cannot consistently outpace the market.\nThe weapons of the practitioners include the reality that some money managers do\noutperform the market over time, that investors often act \u201cirrationally,\u201d and that\nthe market can often be described in anthropomorphic terms\u2014 jubilant, downtrod-\nden, excited, jittery.\nWhich is the truth? The answer is that both models are right and both are wrong.\nIndeed, capital markets display some of the characteristics of both market effi-\nciency and \u201cinefficiency\u201d: a lack of predictability and rapid information assimil\na-\ntion coexist with sudden shifts in prices and \u201cgroup think.\u201d These characteristics\nare part and parcel of a newly articulated phenomenon\u2014 called a \u201ccomplex adap-\ntive system.\u201d Indeed, we believe that capital markets can best be understood as\ncomplex adaptive systems. The rest of this paper is dedicated to developing this\nassertion.\nWhile the notion of capital markets as a complex adaptive system may be rela-\ntively new\u2014 even to studied finance professors\u2014 we believe this framework will be\nthe accepted paradigm for describing capital markets within the next decade, su-\nperseding the current dogma. Shift happens.\nBefore delving into the heart of the case, it is worth outlining a backdrop for so-\ncalled \u201cparadigm shifts.\u201d Thomas Kuhn laid out the best-known framework for\nthis analysis in his seminal book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962).\nKuhn\u2019s process allows us to break down the evolution of ideas into four parts. (See\nTable 1.) First, a theory is laid out to explain a phenomenon. Second, scientists\nstart to \u201ctest\u201d the theory by collecting empirical data. In the process, they find\ncertain facts that run counter to the prevailing theory. Third, scientists\u2014 especially\nthose that have a personal stake in the prevailing theory\u2014 \u201cstretch\u201d the old theory\nto accommodate the new findings, often choosing to dismiss or discount certain\ndata. Finally, a new theory emerges that overtakes the old, offering better fidelity\nto the facts and greater predictive power.\nTable 1\nThe Evolution of Ideas\nI\nA theory is laid out in order to explain a phenomenon\nII\nScientists test the theory and find facts that counter it\nIII\nThe original theory is \u201cstretched\u201d to accommodate new findings\nIV\nA new theory supersedes the old theory\nA simple illustration of a paradigm shift comes from the evolution of human un-\nderstanding of the celestial/terrestrial world. (See Table 2.) Aristotle posited that\nthe universe was geocentric and that the celestial world was \u201cperfect.\u201d The main\nimplication was that orbits around the Earth were circles. As the learned men of\nthe day studied planetary motion, they discovered that orbits were not exactly cir-\ncular, but rather elliptical.

However, to accommodate his empirical\nfindings, Ptolemy had to \u201cstretch\u201d his theory with slight modifications. (See Figure\n1.) Finally, over 1,000 years later Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo, among others,\nintroduced the heliocentric universe and put to rest celestial perfection, ushering in\na new paradigm.1\nTable 2\nThe Evolution of Ideas\u2014 Celestial/Terrestrial Changes\nI     Theory laid out\nAristotle (~340 BC) proposes a geocentric universe with celestial perfec-\nthe orbits of the planets and the sun are perfect circles\nII    Theory tested\nAstronomers observed that orbits are elliptical, not circular\nIII   Theory stretched\nPtolemy (~140 AD) introduces circles-upon-circles, hence accommodating\nhelliptical observations but preserving celestial perfection\nIV   New theory\nCopernicus (~1543), Kepler (~1610) and Galileo (~1600) introduced a\nheliocentric universe, elliptical orbits and celestial imperfection, respec-\nti\nl\nFigure 1\nThe Ideal and a \u201cStretched\u201d Version of Ptolemaic Cosmology\nEarth\nPlanet\n                           \nEarth\nPlanet\nSource: Ptolemy\u2019s Altamost.\nCorrespondence\nWith this process in mind, how do we know whether or not to take a new scientific\ntheory seriously? Bernstein (1994) suggests a test he calls \u201ccorrespondence,\u201d a\nterm borrowed from physicist Niels Bohr. Correspondence has two parts. First, a\nnew idea must explain why the old theory worked, while furthering the under-\nstanding of the phenomenon being studied. Second, the new theory should add\nsome predictive value.\nA ready example is the melding of classical, Newtonian physics with quantum the-\nory. For centuries scientists used Newtonian physics\u2014 powerful as a result of its\ndeterministic focus\u2014 to explain why an apple falls or planets orbit. However, de-\nspite the best efforts of scientists, classical physics offered an incomplete under-\nstanding of electrons. On the other hand, quantum theory, while not very helpful in\neveryday life, explains the counterintuitive notion that electrons can be understood\nboth as waves and as particles. The classical model is a good first approximation\n                                                                   \n1 See Appendix A for more details.\n"

First, we will review the basics of the \u201cold\u201d view\u2014\ncapital market theory. Then, we will see whether or not the empirical studies of\ncapital market behavior are completely consistent with this theory. In particular,\nwe will search for evidence of \u201ctheory-stretch.\u201d Next, we will introduce the new\nparadigm\u2014 the world of complex adaptive systems\u2014 defining terms such as self-\norganized criticality and nonlinearity. Our goal is to judge whether or not these\nnew models can better explain capital markets behavior\u2014 satisfying the practitio-\nners\u2014 while showing why the old theory worked reasonably well\u2014 appeasing the\nivory-tower types. Said differently, we will test the theory for correspondence.\nFinally, we will consider the practical implications for investors.\nWe develop the basics of capital market theory by exploring a few of its key prin-\nciples. These issues cannot, however, be addressed without some comment on the\nfoundation of most economic theory, including financial economics.\nThe bulk of economics is based on equilibrium systems: for example, a balance\nbetween supply and demand, risk and reward, price and quantity. Articulated by\nAlfred Marshall in the 1890s, this view stems from the idea that economics is a\nscience akin to Newtonian physics, with an identifiable link between cause and\neffect and implied predictability. When the equilibrium system is hit by an exog\ne-\nnous shock, it absorbs the shock and returns to an equilibrium state.\nThis equilibrium perspective has associated irony and a significant practical impl\ni-\ncation. The irony is that the convenient, predictable science that economists hold as\nan ideal\u2014 nineteenth century physics\u2014 has been undermined by advances such as\nquantum theory, where indeterminacy is intrinsic. The equilibrium science that\neconomists have mimicked has evolved; economics, by and large, has not.\nThe major implication is that many of the statistical tools used to understand\ncapital market behavior can only be applied if equilibrium theory holds (Fama,\n1963). If this theory does not describe reality, many of the conclusions drawn by\nfinancial economists may be misleading.\nThese observations are not meant to be an indictment of the founding fathers of\nmodern finance. Indeed, their contributions have advanced our knowledge of mar-\nkets by leaps and bounds. Rather, we urge both academics and practitioners to use\nequilibrium-based models with caution. Linear models may have important simpli-\nfying assumptions that do not jibe well with how the world actually works.\nTheory Laid Out\nCapital market theory, largely developed over the past 50 years, rests on a few key\npoints. These include efficient markets, random walk, and rational agents. Our\noutline relies heavily on the structure laid out by Peters (1991). We will consider\neach element in turn, and outline its contribution to the theory:\n\u2022 Stock market efficiency suggests that prices reflect all relevant information\nwhen that information is cheap and widely disseminated (a reasonable description\nof the U.S. stock market). As such, purchasing stocks is a zero net present value\nproposition; you will be compensated for the risk that you assume but no more,\nover time. Market efficiency does not say that stock prices are always \u201ccorrect,\u201d\nbut it does say that stock prices are not systematically mispriced. Market effi-\nClassical Capital\nMarket Theory\n"

A theory developed by Bachelier (1900) and Osborne (1964) and\nsupported empirically by Kendall (1953), random walk suggests that security price\nchanges are independent of one another. The premise is that since capital markets\nare comprised of lots of agents, current prices will reflect the information that is\ncollectively known. Accordingly, changes in prices would come only from unex-\npected information that is, by definition, random. Random walk is an important\nassumption because it implies that the probability distribution of returns will be\nnormal or near normal.\n\u2022 Rational agents is an assumption that investors can assess and optimize\nrisk/reward opportunities. Markowitz (1952), inspired by the work of John Burr\nWilliams (1938), took an important step by linking the potential returns of a port-\nfolio to its riskiness, as measured by the variance of returns. His theory explained\nthat risk-adverse investors would \u201crationally\u201d seek the highest return for a given\nlevel of risk. This idea is formally know as mean/variance efficiency. This model\nserved as the basis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), developed simul-\ntaneously by Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) and later modified by Black\n(1972). CAPM suggests a linear relationship between risk and return. This frame-\nwork of investor behavior is based on equilibrium economics, a linear measure\n(beta), and rational agents. Importantly, the work of Markowitz and the CAPM\nalso rely on the assumption of normally distributed returns, with finite variance.\n2\nThese key principles of capital markets theory have two important underlying as-\nsumptions and one significant predicted outcome. The first premise is that stock\nprice returns can be treated as independent, identically distributed random vari-\nables, unleashing the use of traditional probability calculus\u2014 a powerful tool. The\nsecond assumption is that of rational agents\u2014 either on an individual or a collec-\ntive basis. A predicted outcome of capital markets theory is modest trading activity\nand limited price fluctuations. These assumptions and anticipated outcomes should\nbe matched against the empirical evidence to see if they fit.\nTheory Tested\nTesting started on most capital market theories as soon as the ink dried on the\noriginal research. However, there is an inherent difficulty in testing economic the-\nory. Economists, unlike some other scientists, have no laboratory; their theories\ncan only be evaluated on how they describe events of the past and how well they\npredict events in the future. Further, the amount of quality data is limited. For ex-\nample, the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database\u2014 the primary\nsource of detailed information on stocks and the stock market\u2014 goes back less than\n80 years.\nOf course, the difficulty of performing rigorous analysis has not prevented a steady\nflow of theories on how to \u201cbeat the market.\u201d As any practitioner will attest, most\nof these theories have little merit. Our goal here is not to consider these theories,\n                                                                   \n2 The normal, or Gaussian, distribution is of great importance in science because of the powerful Central Limit Theorem\n(CLT). The CLT states that given a set of independent random variables with a given mean value and finite variance, the\ndistribution is bell shaped, or normal. The CLT tells us it is safe to assume that any physical measurement that repre-\nsents a series of independent variables is going to be normally distributed about its mean.\n"

We\nfind that five of these significantly fall short:\n\u2022 Stock market returns are not normal, as capital market theory suggests. Rather,\nreturn distributions exhibit high kurtosis; the tails are fatter and the mean is higher\nthan what is predicted by a normal distribution. In ordinary language this means\nthat periods of relatively modest change are interspersed with higher-than-\npredicted changes (i.e., booms and crashes). 3 Figures 2 and 3 illustrates the point\ngraphically.

Campbell, Lo, and\nMacKinley (1997), after applying a battery of empirical tests, recently concluded\nthat \u201cfinancial asset returns are predictable to some degree.\u201d Furthermore,\nPeters\u2014 building on the work of Mandelbrot\u2014 suggests that there is a long mem-\nory component in capital markets. That is, return series are often both persistent\nand trend-reinforced.  Non-normal returns and a lack of empirical support call into\nquestion the random walk assumption.4\n\u2022 Trading volume is higher and price changes greater than predicted. Standard\neconomic theory predicts low trading volume and limited price volatility. In reality,\ntrading volume is active and\u2014 as indicated above\u2014 price changes come in greater\nsize than the theory predicts (Shiller, 1981). The most obvious evidence of the lat-\nter point is the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, a day when the S&P 500\nretreated 22.6%. Defending traditional capital market theory in the wake of the\ncrash requires liberal interpretation of the widely taught creed.\n\u2022 Risk and reward are not linearly related via variance.  Fama and French\n(1992) provide a good summary of the empirical tests of CAPM as well as a de-\ntailed analysis for the 1963-1990 period. They conclude, simply: \u201cOur tests do not\nsupport the most basic prediction of the SLB [Sharpe-Lintner-Black] model, that\naverage returns are positively related to the market\u2019s.\u201d They did find that two\nfactors\u2014 firm size and market-to-book value\u2014 explained returns during the meas-\nured period. However, Fama and French maintained a \u201crational asset-pricing\nframework,\u201d which means that they identified the factors associated with various\nreturns and assumed that those returns were attributable to risk. While consistent\nwith the theory that rational agents seek to maximize returns given risk, their con-\nclusions are undermined if those same agents cannot, or do not, optimize the risk/\nreward trade-off.\n\u2022 Investors are not rational. The case here rests on two points. The first is the\ngrowing body of evidence from decision-making theorists showing that humans\nmake systematic judgment errors (Bazerman, 1986; Thaler, 1992). One of the\nbest-documented illustrations is Prospect Theory, developed by Kahneman and\nTversky, which shows that individual risk preferences are profoundly influenced\nby how information is presented. The second point, subtle yet central, is that hu-\nmans generally operate using inductive, not deductive, processes to make economic\ndecisions. As no individual has access to all information, judgments must be based\non what that person \u201cknows\u201d as well as what that person believes others to be-\nlieve. Such decisions are often generated using rules of thumb and suggest a fun-\ndamental indeterminacy in economics (Arthur, 1995). Asset prices are a good\nproxy for aggregate expectations. However, if enough agents adopt decision rules\nbased on price activity\u2014 generated either consciously or randomly\u2014 the resulting\nprice trend can be self-reinforcing.\nTheory Stretched\nA point that Kuhn makes forcefully is that scientists are slow to adopt new theo-\nries. It is understandably difficult for anyone to rapidly devalue a theory in which\nthey have \u201cinvested\u201d substantial resources. This is because of both the economic\nconsequences of admitting relative ignorance and the emotional stress of acknowl-\n                                                                   \n4 However, it does not follow that technical analysis, at least how it is generally practiced, is valuable. Detecting the differ-\nence between a random series and a series with a persistent trend is nearly impossible with a simple stock price chart.\n"

The natural reaction, then, is to modify the current\ntheory as best as possible in order to accommodate reality. However, defenders of\nthe faith can only put so many proverbial fingers in the dam. Eventually, the water\ngushes forth and the challenging theory gains widespread acceptance.\nHere we review some of the reactions, and lack of reaction, to the evidence offered\nin the previous section:\n\u2022 Non-normal distributions. Numerous studies of security returns have unveiled\nhigher-than-expected means and fat tails\u2014 characteristics inconsistent with a\nnormal distribution. However, most economists have been reticent to abandon\nthe normal distribution assumption because it would invalidate the use of tradi-\ntional probability calculus. Mandelbrot (1963) offers that capital market returns\nfollow a stable Paretian5 distribution, which exhibits the attributes empirically\nobserved in markets. Cootner (1964), in his critique of Mandelbrot\u2019s article,\nnoted that most statistical tools would be rendered \u201cobsolete\u201d and past econometric\nwork \u201cmeaningless\u201d if Mandelbrot were right. While willing to further explore\nMandelbrot\u2019s theory, Cootner called for more evidence of its validity before \u201ccon-\nsigning centuries of work to the ash pile.\u201d\n\u2022 Noise traders. Given that efficient markets and rational agents would lead to\nminimal trading volume, the theory of \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cnoise traders\u201d was developed\nto explain the levels of real-life trading activity. Black (1986) described noise\ntrading as \u201ctrading on noise as if it were information\u201d even though \u201cfrom an\nobjective point they [noise traders] would be better off not trading.\u201d He notes that\nnoise traders may be active because \u201cthey like to trade.\u201d Most striking about\nBlack\u2019s paper is the introductory commentary. He writes that: \u201c[noise theories]\nwere all derived originally as a part of a broad effort to apply the logic behind the\ncapital asset pricing model to . . . behavior that does not fit conventional notions of\noptimization.\u201d Admitted theory stretching.\n\u2022 Stock market crashes. While price fluctuations are consistent with a random\nwalk, the frequency and magnitude of such changes are greater than what is pre-\ndicted by theory. The academic reaction to the October 1987 crash\u2014 the greatest\nsingle-day price change to occur since the academic theories were formalized\u2014 is\nrevealing. When asked about the 1987 crash in a recent interview (Tanous, 1997),\nEugene Fama, one of the fathers of efficient market theory, responded: \u201cI think\nthe crash in \u201987 was a mistake.\u201d Miller (1991), after enumerating some potential\nrational economic causes for the crash, recommends reading Mandelbrot\u2014 pre-\ncisely the individual who argued that traditional capital market theory was\nconceptually flawed.\n\u2022 Rational agents and the world of behavior finance. The broadest reaction to\nthe behaviorists\u2014 those that argue that agent rationality should not be assumed in\neconomics\u2014 is dismissal. The reasoning for this hand-wave generally comes in\none of two varieties (DeBondt and Thaler, 1994). The first is that a collection of\nagents\u2014 with errors canceling out\u2014 creates a market similar to one in which agents\nare rational. This \u201cas if\u201d argument, generally attributed to Milton Friedman, ap-\npears reasonable under many circumstances but fails to explain certain anomalies,\n                                                                   \n5 A stable Paretian, or Pareto-Levy, distribution has an undefined variance, unlike a normal distribution.  The properties of\nthese distributions were described by Levy in the 1920s based on the work of Pareto. Pareto found that the distribution\nof income was normal, except for the upper 3%, resulting in a fat tail. As in many cases of fat tails, it was discovered\nthat feedback mechanisms caused these distribution outliers.\n"

For example, Miller (1986) suggests that behavior fi-\nnance is \u201ctoo interesting and thereby distracts us from the pervasive market forces\nthat should be our principal concern.\u201d\nThe established theory has significantly advanced our understanding of capital\nmarkets, but is approaching the limit of its usefulness. The introduction of a new\ntheory, along with the requisite computational power to model it, may usher in a\nnew era of understanding of capital market behavior.\nNow we lay out the challenging theory: capital markets as complex adaptive sys-\ntems. This model is more consistent with what is known in other sciences, such as\nphysics and biology, and appears to be more descriptive of actual capital markets\nactivity.\nThis section is broken into three parts. First, we provide a description of complex\nadaptive systems, identifying key properties and attributes. Next, we compare the\nresults predicted by the new theory to actual market behavior. Finally, we check\nfor correspondence.\nComplex Adaptive Systems: A Definition\nPut two people in a room and ask them to trade a commodity, and the result will\nnot be particularly fascinating. Add a few more people to the room and the activity\nmay pick up, but the interactions remain relatively uninteresting. The system is too\nstatic, too lifeless, to reflect what we see in the capital markets.\nAs more agents are added to the system, however, something remarkable happens:\nit transitions into a so-called \u201ccomplex adaptive system,\u201d replete with new, life-like\ncharacteristics. In a tangible way, the system becomes more complex than the\npieces that comprise it. Importantly, this transition\u2014 often called \u201cself-organized\ncriticality\u201d\u2014 occurs without design or help from any outside agent. Rather, it is a\ndirect function of the dynamic interactions among the agents in the system (Bak,\n1996).6\nBak illustrates self-organized criticality with a sand pile. (See Figure 4.) Start to\nsprinkle sand on a flat surface and the grains settle pretty much where they fall; the\nprocess can be modeled with classical physics. After a modest pile is created the\naction picks up, with small sand slides. Once the pile is of sufficient size, the sys-\ntem becomes \u201cout of balance,\u201d and little disturbances can cause full-fledged ava-\nlanches. These large changes cannot be understood by studying the individual\ngrains. Rather, the system itself gains properties that must be considered sepa-\nrately from the individual pieces.\n                                                                   \n6 Kauffman (1995) has theorized that a similar process explains the beginning of life.\nThe New Theory:\nComplex Adaptive\nSystems\n"

We rely on the work of Holland (1995) in developing these\npoints:\n\u2022 Aggregation. Aggregation is the emergence of complex, large-scale behaviors\nfrom the aggregate interactions of many less complex agents. An example of this\nphenomenon is an ant colony. If you were to \u201cinterview\u201d any single ant about what\nit does, you would hear a narrowly defined task or set of tasks. However, because\nof the interaction of all the ants, a functional and adaptive colony emerges. In\ncapital markets language, the behavior of the market \u201cemerges\u201d from the interac-\ntions of investors.7 This is what Adam Smith called the \u201cinvisible hand.\u201d\n\u2022 Adaptive schema. Agents within a complex adaptive system take information\nfrom the environment, combine it with their own interaction with the environment,\nand derive schema, or decision rules (Gell-Mann, 1994). In turn, various schemata\ncompete with one another based on their \u201cfitness,\u201d with the most effective ones\nsurviving. This process allows for adaptation, which explains the \u201cadaptive\u201d\nwithin the phrase \u201ccomplex adaptive system.\u201d Individual trading rules and invest-\nment rules of thumb can be thought of as schemata in the capital markets.\n\u2022 Nonlinearity. In a linear model, the value of the whole equals the total of the\nparts. In nonlinear systems, the aggregate behavior is more complicated than\nwould be predicted by summing the parts. This point can be illustrated with a\nbasic prey/predator model. Given some basic variables\u2014 predators and prey in a\ngiven area, the rate of interaction between the two and a predator \u201cefficiency\u201d\nmeasure\u2014 the predator/prey model produces the nonlinear outcome of feasts and\n                                                                   \n7 This property is called \u201cemergence\u201d and is a defining characteristic of a complex adaptive system. The inability to fully\nexplain emergent properties stems from the large number of nonlinear interactions.\n"

For the capital markets, this means that cause and effect may not be simplis-\ntically linked.\n\u2022 Feedback loops. A feedback system is one in which the output of one iteration\nbecomes the input of the next iteration. Feedback loops can amplify (positive feed-\nback) or dampen (negative feedback) an effect. One example of positive feedback\nis the multiplier effect, taught in basic economics. Here, additional resources\ngained by one agent typically get passed on in some way to other agents, magnify-\ning the impact of original stimulus. In the capital markets, an example of a feed-\nback loop would be momentum investors using security prices changes as a\nbuy/sell cue, allowing for self-reinforcing behavior. Another example is the \u201ctheory\nof reflexivity,\u201d developed by George Soros.8\nWe now have a framework that, while relatively new, is both consistent with ad-\nvances made in other sciences and promising in its descriptive potential. It now\nmust face the real test: explaining the facts.\nDoes the Theory Conform to Reality?\nWe have established both the basics of traditional capital market theory as well as\nthe inconsistencies between the theory and reality. Now we can see if the new\nframework helps bridge the gap between the two:\n\u2022 Non-normal distributions. Understanding the capital markets as complex adap-\ntive systems would account for the high kurtosis seen in return distributions. In\nparticular, periods of stability punctuated by rapid change, attributable to critical\nlevels, is a characteristic of many complex adaptive systems, including tectonic\nplate activity, bee hives, and evolution. Hence, the observed return distributions,\nbooms and crashes and \u201chigh\u201d levels of trading activity would all be consistent\u2014\neven predicted\u2014 by the new model.\n\u2022 Random walk\u2014 almost. Trend persistence is found throughout nature, and\nshould be no great surprise that it appears to some degree in capital markets. New\nstatistical models, including fractal time series, may help analyze such trends. The\nmain point, however, is that the price activity of the market, assuming it is a com-\nplex adaptive system, would be similar to a classic random walk. The new model,\nhowever, appears to do a better job of explaining persistence.\n\u2022 Homogeneous versus heterogeneous expectations. The ability to relax the as-\nsumption of rational agents\u2014 and the associated assumption of risk/reward effi-\nciency\u2014 also argues for the complex adaptive system model. Shifting from the\nmindset of economic agents as deductive decision-makers, viewed either singularly\nor collectively, to inductive decision makers is crucial. Under most circumstances,\nit is reasonable to assume that the collective, inductive judgments of agents will\nyield an asset price similar to \u201cintrinsic value\u201d when their errors are independent.\nHowever, if certain decision rules are able to gain footing (\u201cbuy when the price\nexceeds X\u201d), the resulting nonindependence of errors can lead to self-reinforcing\ntrends. The key here is that complex adaptive systems can explain the dynamics of\nthe market without assuming that agents have homogeneous expectations.\n                                                                   \n8 See Appendix B for more details.\n"

A complex adaptive system may offer a better\ndescriptive model of the market, but offers little in the way of predictability beyond\nstructural generalizations. In turn, the poor performance of active portfolio manag-\ners is consistent with the new model. That point made, it remains possible that\ncertain investors\u2014 Warren Buffett and George Soros, for example\u2014 may be \u201chard-\nwired\u201d to be successful investors. In this sense \u201chard-wired\u201d suggests innate men-\ntal processes, fortified with practice, that allow for systematically superior security\nselection.\n\u2022 Artificial models simulate market action. Researchers at the Santa Fe Institute\nhave created an artificial stock market that mimics actual market behavior (Arthur\net al., 1997). Their model provides agents with multiple \u201cexpectational models,\u201d\nallows the agents to discard poor performing rules in favor of better performing\nrules, and provides for a discernible \u201cintrinsic value.\u201d Agents are assumed to have\nheterogeneous expectations. The model shows that when the agents replace their\nexpectational models at a low rate, the classical capital market theory prevails.\nHowever, when models are explored more actively, the market transitions to a\ncomplex adaptive system and exhibits the features of real markets (trading activity,\nbooms and crashes). The Santa Fe Institute model, while admittedly simple, illu-\nminates a path for understanding of real capital market behavior.\nThis new theory of market behavior does a better job of explaining reality than the\nold model, but it does so at the expense of a difficult trade-off: by incorporating\nmore realistic assumptions we lose the crispness of current economic models. This\nparadigm shift requires letting go of the determinate and accepting indeterminacy;\ntrading equations with unique equilibrium solutions for models with multiple equi-\nlibria; looking to other fields of science for relevant metaphors.\nThe new model offers us a richer understanding of how markets work. It is also\nencouraging that there may be certain \u201crules\u201d that govern all complex adaptive\nsystems, meaning capital markets may have a lot in common with other natural\nsystems.\nCorrespondence\nThe market as a complex adaptive system passes the test of correspondence. The\nfirst part of correspondence is an explanation of why the preceding theory worked.\nWe see that in a number of instances the effective difference between the old and\nnew theories is modest from a practical standpoint (e.g., the value of most techni-\ncal analysis, predictability). However, this framework can be said to add to our\nunderstanding of capital markets theory by explaining certain results and phe-\nnomenon (crashes, trading activity).\nThe second component of correspondence relates to predictability. While the new\ntheory does not offer predictability in an normative sense,9 the theory is of value in\na descriptive sense. As quantitative models are further developed and refined, there\nmay be hope for greater predictive power in the new framework.\nThe stage appears to be set for a paradigm shift. It is only a question of time.\nWhile some in the academic community have embraced some or all of this new\nunderstanding of markets, they remain a minority. The evidence supporting the\ncomplex adaptive system framework, however, is growing.\n                                                                   \n9 Actually, at least one money management firm, the Prediction Company, does run money with these concepts.\n"

How should investors change their\nbehavior, if at all, to accommodate the complex adaptive system framework? Can\nold tools be applied to the new reality? Here are some thoughts:\n\u2022 The risk and reward link may not be clear. Traditional finance theory assumes\na correlation between risk and reward, with the debate surrounding how to cor-\nrectly measure risk. In a complex adaptive system, however, risk and reward may\nnot be so simplistically linked (Vaga, 1994). More specifically, Peters and Vaga\nhave suggested that owning a stock that exhibits persistence may less risky than\ntraditional theory suggests.10\n\u2022 Cause and effect thinking is dangerous. Humans like to link effects with\ncauses, and capital markets activities are no different. For example, politicians\ncreated numerous panels after the market crash in 1987 to identify its \u201ccause.\u201d A\nnonlinear approach, however, suggests that large-scale changes can come from\nsmall-scale inputs. As a result, cause-and-effect thinking can be both simplistic\nand counterproductive.\n\u2022 Traditional discounted cash flow analysis remains valuable. This is true for\nthree reasons. First, discounted cash flow (DCF) spells out principles: the value of\na financial asset is the present value of future cash flows discounted appropriately.\nSecond, a DCF model remains an excellent framework for sorting out key invest-\nment issues. Finally, there is arguably no better available quantitative model than\nthe DCF for crystallizing expectations impounded in stock prices. The main caveat\nto the use of a DCF framework is that investors need to remain aware that many\nfactors play into expectations\u2014 including the investor\u2019s personal biases\u2014 that may\nnot be easy to model.\n\u2022 Strategy in the new paradigm world. As the economy evolves from one that is\nmanufacturing based to one that is information based, microeconomics are chang-\ning as well (Arthur, 1996; Beinhocker, 1997). For example, some economists have\nargued that certain businesses enjoy increasing, not decreasing, returns on invest-\nment as a result of path dependence and technological lock-in. Investors in tech-\nnology may have separate rules to play by, all steeped in the basics of complex\nadaptive systems.\nThe academics and the practitioners can now touch gloves in the middle of the ring\nwith the knowledge that the \u201ctruth\u201d lies somewhere between their polar views. The\ntie that binds the two camps is the new paradigm of markets as complex adaptive\nsystems. Acceptance of this stance requires the modification of current thinking,\nbut opens the door for a perspective that is supported by other areas of science and\nthat spans the gap between current theory and reality.\n                                                                   \n10 See Appendix C for more details.\nPractical Investor\nConsiderations\nConclusions\n"

Aristotle posited that the universe orbited around the earth.\nMoreover, he assumed that the sun and outer planets orbited the earth in perfect\ncircles. Scientists found these notions so appealing that they engaged in mental\ngymnastics to preserve their place at the center of the universe.\nIndeed, 500 years later, the Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy resorted to the convo-\nluted idea of epicycles, or \u201ccircles-upon-circles,\u201d in which the outer planets orbited\nin a circle around an imaginary point that itself orbited the earth in a perfect\ncircle. (See Figure 1.) In addition to fairly accurately describing elliptical orbits,\nPtolemy\u2019s epicycles theory explained the phenomenon of \u201cretrograde motion\u201d\u2014\nwhere certain planets reverse their direction across the earth\u2019s sky.  However, to\nsave the geocentric paradigm, Ptolemy had to stretch his theory with additional\nconjectures: a slightly off center earth, and the equant, another off-center\nimaginary point around which a planet orbited. Thus, the Ptolemaic scheme\nbecame less accurate as the centuries rolled by, and its parameters and constants\nhad to continually revised by Arabic and Christian astronomers.\nThe inaccuracy of Ptolemaic system posed more than an abstract problem for sci-\nentists. After Julius Caesar adopted the Egyptian solar calendar, it became the\nclock of the Western world. However, after 16 centuries, the overly simple Julian\nsystem\u2014 with 365-day years and a leap year every fourth year\u2014 had accrued\nenough errors so that it was ahead by 10 days. As a result, the Pope, in 1514,\nasked Copernicus, a Polish clergyman and astronomer, to look into calendar re-\nform. Copernicus solved the problems that had stymied Ptolemy and the millennia\nof astronomers who followed him, but his resulting heliocentric theory placed the\nSun instead of the earth at the center of the universe.

The company can\nthen turn around and use that money to make an acquisition that increases a metric\nof financial performance, say, earnings per share or return on invested capital.\nThis improvement in the company fundamentals pleases investors, who then bid up\nthe company\u2019s share price.  If the company repeats this cycle by then returning to\nthe capital markets once more, it can enjoy the benefits of a \u201cbenign circle\u201d that\nimproves its fortunes by means of this reflexive loop.\nNote that the reflexivity embedded in this model\u2014 which classical economics sim-\nply assumes away\u2014 has several important implications. First and foremost, peo-\nple\u2019s expectations affect the very reality from which they infer those expectations.\nThis feedback loop creates a fundamental uncertainty about reality, for investors\u2019\n     If a company can take\nadvantage of market prices\nto affect its fundamentals.\nThen, a company can change\nits fundamentals by taking\nthese actions.\n(Cause)\n(Effect)\nIf a company can\ntake advantage of\nmarket prices to\naffect its\nfundamentals.\nThen, a company\ncan change its\nfundamentals by\ntaking these actions.\nIf investors can assess\nthe fundamentals, i.e.\nthe magnitude and\nriskiness of cash flows\naccruing to a stock.\nThen this data\ndetermines intrinsic\nvalue.  In the\naggregate, investors\u2019\nexpectations determine\na stock\u2019s share price.\n"

He had a problem\nwith reservoir control, and attempted to construct a model that would resolve the\nissue. His first assumption\u2014 and that of most hydrologists of the day\u2014 was that\nrainfall, and hence the influx of water, followed a random walk. However, the tool\nhe developed, called the Hurst exponent, showed that the system followed a \u201cbi-\nased random walk\u201d\u2014 a discernible trend mixed with noise. In fact, Hurst found\nthat most natural systems\u2014 temperatures, rainfall, and sunspots\u2014 are biased ran-\ndom walks.\nHurst laid out a generalization of Brownian motion, rescaled range (R/S) analysis,\nthat could be applied to a broader class of time series. Hurst\u2019s analysis can distin-\nguish between a random series and a nonrandom series, and hence has applicability\nfor capital markets. The general equation is as follows:\nR/S = (k*n)H\nwhere R/S\n= rescaled range (range/standard deviation)\nn\n= number of observations\nk\n= a constant\nH\n= Hurst exponent\nThere are three possibilities for the value of H:\n\u2022 \nH = .5\nThis is an independent series, or random walk.\n\u2022 \n0 < H < .5 This is an antipersistent series, which means it is mean-reverting.\nThis is, if increasing it is more likely to decrease in the next period and vice\nversa.\n\u2022 \n.5 < H <1\nThis is a persistent series, which means that increases are likely to\nbe followed be additional increases. Often, the persistence effect lasts for a\ndiscernible cycle.\nBloomberg Financial Services calculates Hurst exponents for stocks and major\nindices.

General Electric stock, with an H of .50, appears to follow a random\nwalk while Coca-Cola, with an H of .77, demonstrates strong persistence. Philip\nMorris returns are antipersistent. An important caveat: given the scarcity of inputs\nand potential explanations for the results, we would be hesitant to draw too many\nconclusions based on these data.\nPeters has suggested that higher H values mean less risk because there is less noise\nin the data. This is in contrast to the standard finance theory that links risk with\nvariance.\nRisk measurement remains an enigmatic issue. While the Hurst exponent may not\nbe the solution to the problem of risk quantification, it may prove to be a step in\nthe right direction.\nN.B.:  CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager or\nco-manager of a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies men-\ntioned.
