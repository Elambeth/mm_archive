      "text": " \n \nJanuary 15, 2015 \n \nManaging the Man Overboard Moment \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nA key part of successful investing is the ability to keep emotions in check in the face of adversity. One \nexample, the focus of this report, is when one of the stocks in your portfolio drops sharply. If you are the \nportfolio manager, you might feel frustrated, upset about the hit to returns, and worried about the business \nimplications. If you are the analyst, you might feel anger, disappointment, and shame. None of those feelings \nare conducive to good decision making.    \n \nThis kind of event precipitates what has been called a \u201cman overboard\u201d moment.1 These moments demand \nimmediate attention, are stressful, and require swift action. In an investment firm it is common for a number of \nprofessionals to stop what they are doing in order to discern a suitable course of action.   \n \nThe use of a checklist is one approach to making good decisions under pressure. In his superb book, The \nChecklist Manifesto, Dr. Atul Gawande describes two types of checklists.2 The first is called DO-CONFIRM. \nHere you do your job from memory but pause periodically to make sure that you have done everything you\u2019re \nsupposed to do. The second is called READ-DO. Here, you simply read the checklist and do what it says. \nREAD-DO checklists are particularly helpful in stressful situations because they prevent you from being \novercome by emotion as you decide how to act.   \n \nYou can think of your emotional state and the ability to make good decisions as sitting on opposite sides of a \nseesaw. If your state of emotional arousal is high, your capacity to decide well is low. A checklist helps take \nout the emotion and moves you toward a proper choice. It also keeps you from succumbing to decision \nparalysis. A psychologist studying emergency checklists in aviation said the goal is to \u201cminimize the need for a \nlot of effortful analysis when time may be limited and workload is high.\u201d3  \n \nThe goal of this report is to provide you with analytical guidance if one of your stocks declines 10 percent or \nmore, relative to the S&P 500, in one day. More directly, we want to answer the question of whether you \nshould buy, hold, or sell the stock following one of these big down moves.     \n \nExhibit 1 shows the number of such observations from January 1990 through mid-2014. There were more \nthan 5,400 occurrences in all, with clusters around the deflating of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and \nthe financial crisis in 2008-2009. The bubble periods contain about 40 percent of the observations. These \nsharp drops happen frequently enough that they deserve a thoughtful process to deal with them but \ninfrequently enough that few investment firms have developed such a process.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can rely on the specific circumstances of a \nparticular situation as well as your own experience. This is known as the inside view. Or you can examine a \nlarger reference class to understand the base rates. This is known as the outside view.4   \n \nFor example, if you are forecasting the returns for the stock market in the next year you can use the inside \nview to come up with an estimate based on current valuation, sentiment, and your own gut feel. Or you can \nuse the outside view and examine how the stock market has done over the years. Both the inside and outside \nview are useful, and there is a specific way to combine the two to allow for an effective forecast.5 But \nresearch in decision making suggests that we naturally rely more on the inside view than we should.6 In fact, it \nis common for investors to be unaware of the base rates that are relevant in their decisions.  \n \nWe use base rates to show how stocks perform after they have dropped sharply. To do this, we calculate the \n\u201ccumulative abnormal return\u201d for the 30, 60, and 90 trading days after the time of the decline. An abnormal \nreturn is the difference between the total shareholder return and the expected return. A stock\u2019s expected \nreturn reflects the change in a broader stock market index, the S&P 500 in our case, adjusted for risk. The \ncumulative abnormal return, then, is simply the sum of the abnormal returns during the period that we \nmeasure.       \n \nWe refine the large sample into relevant categories in an effort to increase the usefulness of the base rates.7 \nThe first refinement is to segregate earnings and non-earnings announcements. Earnings releases constitute \nabout one-quarter of our sample. Non-earnings announcements include releases of information that are \nscheduled, such as same-store sales updates, as well as unanticipated announcements, including a change in \nmanagement or an earnings warning. In general, the cumulative abnormal returns following disappointing \nearnings releases are worse than for other announcements. \n \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n1990\n1993\n1996\n1999\n2002\n2005\n2008\n2011\n2014\nNumber of Observations\n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 15, 2015 \n \nManaging the Man Overboard Moment \n4 \nThe second refinement is the introduction of three factors\u2014momentum, valuation, and quality\u2014that consider \ncorporate fundamentals and stock market measures. All companies receive a score for each factor. The \nscores are relative to a company\u2019s peers in the same sector. You can find a detailed definition of the factors in \nAppendix A, but here\u2019s a quick summary: \n \uf402\n Momentum predominately considers two drivers, change in cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae\uf02a) as \nthe result of earnings revisions, and stock price momentum. Good momentum is associated with rising \nCFROI and strong stock price appreciation. \n \uf402\n Valuation reflects the gap between the current stock price and the warranted value in the HOLT\u00ae model. \nValuation also incorporates adjusted measures of price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. Together, \nthese metrics help assess whether a stock is relatively cheap or expensive.  \n \uf402\n Quality captures the company\u2019s recent level of CFROI and whether the company has been able to \nconsistently make investments that create value. Firms with high CFROIs and strong value creation score \nwell on quality. \n \nThe final refinement is a separation between the full sample and the periods excluding the bubbles. We show \nthe full sample including all events in exhibits 2 and 3, and the narrower sample excluding the bubble periods \nin exhibits 12 and 13. The bubble periods correlate with high volatility in the market, as measured by the \nChicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX). When you compare the full sample to the ex-\nbubble sample for earnings announcements, you will see that the average stock price changes for the \nequivalent branches are directionally the same more than 80 percent of the time. For the other events, the \ndirectional overlap is close to 90 percent.  \n \nThe upside of adding refinements is that you can find a base rate that closely matches the case you are \nconsidering. The downside is that the sample size (N) shrinks with each refinement. We have tried to maintain \nhealthy sample sizes even in the end branches, and we display the Ns along the way so that you can assess \nthe trade-off between fit and prior occurrences. \n \nWe are almost ready to turn to the checklist and numbers, but we need to cover one additional item. All of our \nsummary exhibits show the average, or mean, stock price return. That average represents a full distribution of \nresults. For most of the distributions, the median return\u2014the return that separates the top half from the \nbottom half of the sample\u2014is less than the mean, which suggests the distributions have a right skew.  \n \nFurther, the standard deviations of most of the distributions are in the range of 35-45 percent. While our \nsummary figures show a tidy average, recognize that the figure belies a rich distribution. Appendix B shows \nthe distributions for a handful of events. The base rate data can be extremely helpful in making a sound \ndecision even if the outcome is probabilistic.  \n \nWe\u2019re now ready to turn to the checklist and the numbers that show the base rates. \n \n \n                                                 \n \n\uf02a CFROI\n\u00ae is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding the United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse \nGroup AG or its affiliates. \n"

      "text": " \n \nJanuary 15, 2015 \n \nManaging the Man Overboard Moment \n5 \nThe Checklist \n \nYou come into the office and one of the stocks in your portfolio is down 10 percent or more relative to the \nS&P 500. Here\u2019s what you do: \n \uf403\n Earnings or non-earnings. Determine whether the precipitating announcement is an earnings release or \na non-earnings disclosure and go to the appropriate exhibit;  \n \uf403\n Momentum. Check the HOLT Lens\u2122 screen to determine if the stock had strong, weak, or neutral \nmomentum going into the announcement. You can either go to the momentum section of the exhibit or \ncontinue;   \n \uf403 \nValuation. Check to see if the valuation is cheap, expensive, or neutral. You can either go to the section in \nthe exhibit that combines momentum and valuation or continue;   \n \uf403\n Quality. Check to see if the quality is high, low, or neutral. Go to section in the exhibit that incorporates all \nof the factors.  \n \nWe have two detailed case studies that we\u2019ll present in a moment, but let\u2019s run through an example to see \nhow this works. The first item is to determine whether the announcement was a scheduled earnings release or \nnot. Let\u2019s say it was an earnings event. That means we would refer to the data in exhibit 2. \n \nStep two is to assess the momentum. We\u2019ll assume that momentum is strong. If you look at the left side of \nthe exhibit you\u2019ll see the section that reflects momentum. If you focus on the results of the companies with \nstrong momentum, you\u2019ll see a few figures. You\u2019ll notice that the 408 stocks in that reference class declined \n14.9 percent, on average, the day of the event. You\u2019ll also see that those stocks modestly underperformed \nthe market, with a cumulative abnormal return of -1.6 percent, in the prior 30 trading days. \n \nYou\u2019ll also see that the stocks in that class struggled in the subsequent quarter, with cumulative abnormal \nreturns of -1.5 percent in the next 30 trading days, -1.9 percent in 60 trading days, and -0.6 percent in 90 \ntrading days. We selected 90 trading days as the extent of this analysis because we felt it is a sufficient \namount of time for an investment team to thoroughly reassess the stock\u2019s merit. We designed the READ-DO \nchecklist to provide immediate guidance.  \n \nWe now turn to valuation, which you can find in the middle of the exhibit, to see if we can sharpen the analysis. \nLet\u2019s assume the valuation was expensive. If we look 60 days out, we see that the 167 stocks in this group \nhave an average cumulative abnormal return of -4.5 percent.    \n \nAs a final check, we consider quality, which you can find on the right of the exhibit. Let\u2019s say quality is high. \nWe\u2019ve now shrunk our sample size to 62, and see that the 60-day cumulative abnormal return is -3.5 percent.    \n"

This was a non-earnings event. \n \nSince we use cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for all of the stock performance data, it is worth taking a moment \nto explain the methodology. We calculate daily abnormal return using a simplified market model, which compares \nthe actual return of a stock to its expected return. The expected return equals the total shareholder return of the \nbenchmark, the S&P 500, times the stock\u2019s beta. The abnormal return is the difference between the actual return \nand the expected return. \n \nWe calculate beta by doing a regression analysis with the S&P 500\u2019s total returns as the independent variable (x-\naxis) and Symantec\u2019s total returns as the dependent variable (y-axis). We use monthly total returns for the prior 60 \nmonths. Beta is the slope of the best-fit line. Exhibit 4 shows that the beta for Symantec for the 60 months ended \nFebruary 2014 was about 0.8. This is the beta we use for our calculations of daily abnormal returns during the \nmonth of March 2014. \n \nExhibit 4: Beta Calculation for Symantec \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \n \n \n \n \n \ny = 0.812x - 0.005\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nSymantec\nS&P 500\nMonthly Returns\nMarch 2009 - February 2014\n"

For the purposes of this analysis, a score of 66 or more \nreflects strong momentum, cheap valuation, and high quality. A score of 33 or less means weak momentum, \nexpensive valuation, and low quality. Numbers from 34 to 65 are neutral for the factors.

      "text": " \nJanuary 15, 2015 \n \nManaging the Man Overboard Moment \n15 \nSummary \n \nThe goal of this analysis is to provide you with useful base rates in the case that you see a sharp drop\u2014a \n\u201cman overboard\u201d moment\u2014in one of the stocks in your portfolio. These base rates are meant to offer some \nguidance in determining whether you should buy, sell, or do nothing the day following the event. You should \nkeep this report handy, and when an event occurs you can pull it out and follow the steps in the checklist. The \nresults contained here are a useful complement to fundamental analysis.   \n \nBecause these events tend to be infrequent, most investors don\u2019t have a systematic approach, or data, to \nmake a sound judgment. Further, large price drops almost always evoke a strong emotional reaction, which \ncomplicates the process of decision making even more.   \n \nOur examination of exhibits 2 and 3 suggests that the following characteristics are consistent with buy and sell \nsignals: \n \nBuy. For earnings releases, there is a clear and convincing buy signal for stocks with weak momentum prior \nto the event. This buy signal is strengthened if the stock has a cheap valuation and is of high quality.  \n \nThe buy signal for stocks with weak momentum is even more pronounced for non-earnings events than it is \nfor earnings releases, although these stocks had worse shareholder returns leading up to the event. This \nsignal is stronger for stocks that have a cheap valuation, and is further amplified if the companies are of high \nor neutral quality. Symantec, the subject of our first case study, was a non-earnings event with weak \nmomentum, cheap valuation, and high quality, and hence the data suggested a buy. \n \nSell. For earnings releases, momentum alone does not indicate a strong buy or sell pattern. But there is a \nfairly strong sell signal for stocks that have the combination of strong momentum and expensive valuation. The \nsell signal holds for stocks with strong momentum, expensive valuation, and any quality score. Tenet \nHealthcare, our second case, had strong momentum, expensive valuation, and low quality\u2014factors that \nsuggested selling the shares.  \n \nFor non-earnings events, the cumulative abnormal returns following an event are largely positive. But we must \nnote that these stocks as a group performed poorly prior to the event, down more than five percentage points \nrelative to the market. There are a couple of combinations that suggest selling the stock. The strongest sell \nsignal is for companies that combine strong or neutral momentum, expensive valuation, and high quality. \nStrong or neutral momentum and expensive valuation alone do not indicate a sell signal.  \n \nMaking decisions in the face of uncertainty is always a challenge, but it is inherent to investing. Deciding what \nto do with a stock following a sharp decline is particularly difficult because emotions tend to run high after \nthose events. This report provides grounding in the form of base rates in an effort to better inform decisions.  \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \nJanuary 15, 2015 \n \nManaging the Man Overboard Moment \n18 \nAppendix A: Definition of the Factors  \n \nMomentum: Momentum is a gauge of market sentiment. Stocks that score well have rising levels of expected \nCFROI as the result of upward earnings revisions, positive stock price momentum, and good liquidity.  \uf402\n CFROI Key Momentum, 13-week (60%) - CFROI Key Momentum measures change in the level of \nexpected CFROI following revisions in consensus earnings per share.  \uf402\n Price Momentum (52-week) (30%) - Price Momentum is based on the percentage change in market \nvalue over the past 52 weeks.  \uf402\n Daily Liquidity Average (10%) - Daily Liquidity Average reflects the number of shares traded in the last \nquarter, divided by 63 trading days, multiplied by the stock price at the end of the most recent week, \ndivided by market capitalization.  \n \nValuation: Valuation assesses the difference between the stock\u2019s warranted value, based on the HOLT \nframework\u00ae, and the stock\u2019s current market price. Stocks with the most upside are cheap, and those with the least \nupside, or downside, are expensive.  \uf402\n Percentage Change to Best Price (50%) - Percentage Change to Best Price measures the difference \nbetween HOLT\u2019s warranted value and the current stock price. By using a discounted cash flow approach \nthat standardizes financial figures, the HOLT model generates values that allow for the comparison of firms \nacross regions, sectors, and accounting standards.  \uf402\n Economic P/E (30%) \u2013 Economic P/E is HOLT\u2019s version of a price-to-earnings ratio. You can compare \nEconomic P/E across companies and industries because the value-to-cost ratio is divided by CFROI, \nnormalizing results. Specifically, Economic P/E = (Enterprise Value / Inflation Adjusted Net Assets) / \nCFROI  \uf402\n Value-to-Cost Ratio (10%) \u2013 Value-to-Cost Ratio is analogous to price/book value, but reflects a \nnumber of adjustments that reduce volatility and better reflect firm value. These include inflation \nadjustments for old plant and inventory in gross investment, capitalized research and development (R&D), \ncapitalized operating leases, the reflection of the contingent claim for stock options in debt, pension debt, \npreferred stock, and liabilities related to capitalized operating leases. The Value-to-Cost Ratio = (Market \nValue of Equity + Minority Interest + HOLT Debt) / Inflation Adjusted Net Assets  \uf402\n Dividend Yield (10%) \u2013 Dividend Yield is the dividends paid in the last 12 months divided by the most \nrecent share price.  \n \nQuality: Quality measures a company\u2019s record of generating cash and managing growth, independent of \nexpectations about the future. Firms that score well have high CFROIs and have shown the ability to grow profitable \nbusinesses or the willingness to shrink unprofitable ones.  \uf402\n CFROI Last Fiscal Year (50%) - CFROI Last Fiscal Year is the ratio of gross cash flow to gross \ninvestment and is expressed as an internal rate of return. We use the CFROI for the last reported fiscal \nyear.  \uf402\n Managing for Value (30%) - Managing for Value equals the spread between CFROI and the Discount \nRate, multiplied by the inflation-adjusted gross investment. This allows us to determine whether the \ncompany\u2019s growth creates value and is sustainable. Growth in businesses that earn a CFROI in excess of \nthe cost of capital is value creating, while growth in businesses with a negative spread destroys value.  \uf402\n Change in Value Creation (20%) - Change in Value Creation measures the improvement in \u201ceconomic \nprofit\u201d in the most recent fiscal year. A positive value indicates that the company either increased the \nspread between CFROI and the discount rate, or grew in a business with a positive spread. Change in \nValue Creation = (CFROI \u2013 Discount Rate * Growth Rate) \u2013 Prior Fiscal Year Spread. \n"

Much of this academic \nwork was done in the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. We found no papers that trace the steps we follow:  \n \n1. Observe relative price declines of 10 percent or more; \n \n2. Sort based on scheduled earnings and non-earnings events;  \n \n3. Introduce factors to refine the reference classes; \n \n4. Observe cumulative abnormal returns by reference class.  \n \nThese studies are equivocal. Most do show statistically significant reversals after sharp one-day drops. But \nsome of the potential explanations for the rebound, including stock market seasonality, changing risk, size \neffects, and the role of bid-ask spreads, call into question whether the price action reflects a true inefficiency. \nThe papers we consulted include the following: \n \nAtkins, Allen B., and Edward A.

It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary \nquantitative algorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all \nthe companies included in its database. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default \nvariables and incorporated into the algorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and \nearnings data provided by outside data vendors are subject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying \neconomics of firm performance. These adjustments provide consistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies \nacross industries or national borders. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline \nvaluation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce alternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional \ninformation about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request. \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT \nvaluation model establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default \nvariables may also be adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT \nmethodology is available on request. \n\u00a9 2015 CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved \n \n"
