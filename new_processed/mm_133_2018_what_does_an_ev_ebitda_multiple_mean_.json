Whether debt or equity, public or private, \nwe need to understand value to assess if a \nprice presents an opportunity to create alpha. \n \nThere is a rich literature on valuation, which is \nstraightforward in theory but often \nchallenging in practice. A business is worth \nthe present value of future free cash flows, but \nforecasting the magnitude, timing, and \nriskiness of cash flow streams is inherently \ndifficult. As a result, most investors rely on \nshorthands for the valuation process.   \n \nThe EV/EBITDA multiple is among the most \npopular techniques to value businesses. \nApplied properly, EV/EBITDA can be a very \nhelpful tool. But a naive use of EV/EBITDA \nleads to valuation mistakes.  \n \n \n \n \nWe find that investors commonly employ \nEV/EBITDA without being fully aware of the \nunderlying economic assumptions the multiple \nimplies.    \n \nThe spread between return on invested \ncapital and the cost of capital, along with \nearnings growth, are the primary determinants \nof a warranted EV/EBITDA multiple. We seek to \napply multiples intelligently, rigorously, and \nconsistently.  \n  \nIn this report, Michael\u2019s treatment of \nEV/EBITDA goes from theory to practice to \nempirical evidence. As always, we would be \npleased to discuss specific examples of how \nwe apply these principles. \n \n \nAndrew Feldstein \n \nChief Investment Officer \nSeptember 13, 2018 \n"

Mauboussin \nDirector of Research \nmmauboussin@bmcm.com \n \nThis report is about the EV/EBITDA multiple, or enterprise value divided \nby earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It is a \nwidely used and misused approach to valuation. We put EV/EBITDA in \nhistorical context, define terms, and describe some of the limitations of using \nthe multiple. We then show how to relate EV/EBITDA multiples to sound \ntheory. We continue by sharing empirical findings to demonstrate that the \nmarket reflects the economic drivers of value and showing how multiples of \nEV/EBITDA and price-to-earnings relate to one another. We finish with \nspecific recommendations for how to use EV/EBITDA multiples as \neffectively as possible.  \nHere is the bottom line: A naive use of EV/EBITDA leads to valuation \nmistakes. The warranted multiple is predominantly a function of value \ncreation, growth, and risk. Companies with multiples above the warranted \nlevel underperform those with multiples below their warranted level.1 \nThoughtful investors take the time to understand the assumptions that are \nembedded in the multiples they use.  \nA Brief History of Valuation and \nthe Emergence of EBITDA \nEquity valuation techniques have evolved over \ntime. One hundred years ago, investors valued \nstocks on metrics such as dividend yield, the \nprice-to-earnings multiple, and the price-to-book \nvalue multiple.2 For example, Benjamin Graham \nand David Dodd\u2019s classic text from 1934, Security \nAnalysis, suggests that the dividend rate and \nrecord, earning power, and asset value are the \nbasis for common stock valuation.3 In 1938, John \nBurr Williams formalized the dividend discount \nmodel in The Theory of Investment Value.4 Myron \nGordon\u2019s growth model, described in 1959, \nshowed how to capitalize dividend growth.5 The \nemphasis on dividends was well placed, as the \nyields on stocks remained consistently above \nthose of investment-grade bonds until 1958. That \nstocks came to yield less than bonds appeared \nheretical to market veterans of the day, who \nnoted that stocks are riskier than bonds and \nhence should yield more. But dividend yields \nremained below bond yields until a crisis hit the \nfinancial markets 50 years later.6 \n\u201cDividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of \nShares,\u201d a paper published in 1961 by the finance \nprofessors Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani, \nushered in the modern era of valuation.7 They \nasked a fundamental question: What does the \nequity market discount? They considered four \npossibilities, including cash flow, current earnings\n"

Considered \ncorrectly, these all collapse into the same model. \nThe value of a stock is the present value of future \nfree cash flows. This is what you learned if you \nstudied finance in school. \nBut there has always been a gap between theory \nand practice. The main reason is that the \ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model, while \nanalytically sound, demands a number of \njudgments. The model\u2019s output varies greatly \nbased on the inputs. There are ways to deal with \nthis challenge, but most practitioners avoid a DCF \nmodel altogether and instead use shorthands in \nthe form of multiples.8 It is crucial to acknowledge \nthat multiples are not valuation but rather a \nsummary of the valuation process. This distinction \nis a point of emphasis throughout this report.   \nA recent survey found that the two most popular \nmultiples are price-to-earnings (P/E) and \nEV/EBITDA. The survey of nearly 2,000 investors \nfound 93 percent of them use multiples, with 88 \npercent applying P/E and 77 percent EV/EBITDA.9      \nThe trend toward EV/EBITDA is not limited to \ninvestors. Researchers analyzed tens of thousands \nof annual reports and earnings releases for \ncompanies in the S&P 1500 for the decade \nended 2016 and found that roughly 15 percent of \nthem highlight EBITDA. Companies that \nemphasize EBITDA are on average smaller, more \nleveraged, more capital intensive, and less \nprofitable than their peers.10 The use of EBITDA is \nmost popular in the entertainment, healthcare, \ntelecommunications, and publishing industries.11 \nInvestors have used P/E multiples for a long time, \nbut EV/EBITDA is a relatively recent valuation \nproxy. Will Thorndike, an investor and the author \nof The Outsiders, credits John Malone with \nintroducing the term EBITDA.12 Malone is a media \nmogul who made his fortune with investments in \nTele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media \nCorporation, among other companies. Malone \njoined Tele-Communications, Inc. in 1973. Exhibit 1 \nshows the popularity of earnings per share and \nEBITDA in books that Google scans. References to \nearnings have been roughly stable for the last 40 \nyears, but EBITDA has trended up steadily since it \nburst onto the valuation scene in the late 1980s. \nEarly enthusiasts cited three reasons to use EBITDA \nrather than a more traditional metric. First, it is  \nExhibit 1: References to \u201cEBITDA\u201d and \u201cEarnings \nPer Share\u201d in Books, 1960-2008 \n \nSource: Google Ngram. \na broad measure of cash flow and indicates the \ncapacity to invest and service debt. Second, it \ncan be relevant for companies losing money \nbecause EBITDA is often positive even when \nearnings are negative. Finally, EBITDA appears \nmore applicable for companies that seek to \nminimize taxes by adding debt, as interest \nexpense is tax deductible.13   \nPartly reflecting these reasons, EV/EBITDA became \nthe main metric investors used to evaluate \nleveraged buyouts in the 1980s and it remains the \nprimary way to value private equity deals. \nMost analysts who work for investment banks \nearly in their careers learn to rely predominantly \non EV/EBITDA for valuation. They commonly move \non to positions at private equity firms or hedge \nfunds, bringing their valuation practices with \nthem.14 As alternative asset classes have grown \nrelative to more traditional ones, so too has the \napplication of EBITDA. \nEBITDA multiples even appear frequently in the \nwork of analysts who use a DCF model. Most DCF \nmodels have an explicit forecast period and a \nresidual, or terminal, value to reflect the cash \nflows beyond the explicit period. The vast majority \nof private equity firms, for example, model explicit \ncash flows for five years and many use EBITDA \nmultiples to estimate the terminal value.15  \nSince the terminal value can make up 70 percent \nor more of the enterprise value, the explicit cash \nflows are mostly just the path to the main event\u2014\nthe decision of what multiple to apply to the last \nyear of cash flow.16 There are effective methods \nto deal with this analytical challenge as well, but \nfew investors use them.17  \n0.00000\n0.00001\n0.00002\n0.00003\n0.00004\n0.00005\n0.00006\n0.00007\n1960\n1963\n1966\n1969\n1972\n1975\n1978\n1981\n1984\n1987\n1990\n1993\n1996\n1999\n2002\n2005\n2008\nPercent\nEarnings Per Share\nEBITDA\n"

Enterprise value is the value of the core \noperations less nonoperating assets, such as \nexcess cash and nonconsolidated subsidiaries. \nEnterprise value is also equal to short- and long-\nterm debt, debt equivalents, and other claims \n(e.g., restricted stock units), less excess cash and \nnonoperating assets, plus equity value.  \nEBITDA is operating profit (earnings before interest \nand taxes, or EBIT) plus depreciation and \namortization expenses (DA). EBITDA does not \nreflect interest expense, taxes, or investments \nrequired to maintain or grow the business, \nincluding changes in net working capital, capital \nexpenditures, and acquisitions. Because EBITDA \ncan be distributed to all claimholders, it is \nappropriate to compare it to enterprise value.   \nEBITDA is not subject to generally accepted \naccounting principles (GAAP), but the straight \ncalculation is based on figures that do adhere to \nGAAP. That EBITDA is a non-GAAP sum creates a \ngreat deal of flexibility and encourages \ncompanies to take some liberty in how they \ndefine the term. The most common of these is \nadjusted EBITDA, which removes non-recurring \nitems such as restructuring charges and \nimpairment costs and adds items such as \nacquisition synergies and other anticipated cost \nsavings. For example, companies acquired by \nprivate equity firms that issued debt made \nadjustments that increased their EBITDA by an \naverage of 13.7 percent in 2017, up from 9.6 \npercent in 2016. The industries with the largest \nadjustments include healthcare, gaming, and \ntechnology.18 \nJason Zweig, a journalist at the Wall Street \nJournal, ticks off some of the other flavors he has \nseen: EBITDAC, EBITDAO, EBITDAP, EBITDAR, \nEBITDARE, EBITDAS or EBITDASC, EBITDAX, and \n\u201ccommunity-adjusted EBITDA,\u201d which, he reports, \nexcludes such basic costs of doing business as \nmarketing, development, and administrative \nexpenses.19 \n \n \n \nLimitations of EBITDA \nThere is evidence that the EV/EBITDA multiple can \nbe helpful for investors. For example, the \nEV/EBITDA multiple is a useful quantitative factor \nand explains market valuations and predicts \nstock returns better than operating profit does.20 \nBut deep skepticism remains about its utility, \nespecially in the value investing community, \nbecause of what it fails to reflect. For example, \nWarren Buffett, chairman and chief executive \nofficer of Berkshire Hathaway, had this to say \nabout EBITDA at Berkshire\u2019s annual shareholder \nmeeting in 2003:21 \nAny management that doesn\u2019t regard \ndepreciation as an expense is living in a \ndream world. But of course, they are \nencouraged to do that by investment \nbankers who talk to them about EBITDA. And \ncertain people have built fortunes on \nmisleading investors by convincing them that \nEBITDA was a big deal.  \nI get these people that want to send me \nbooks with EBITDA in it. And I just tell \u2018em, \u201cI\u2019ll \nlook at that figure when you tell me you\u2019ll \nmake all of the future capital expenditures for \nme.\u201d   \nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s vice chairman, Charlie \nMunger, added a more colorful quip:  \nI think you\u2019d understand any presentation \nusing the word \u201cEBITDA\u201d if every time you saw \nthat word, you just substituted the phrase \n\u201cbullshit earnings.\u201d \nSeth Klarman, the founder, chief executive, and \nportfolio manager of the very successful value \ninvesting firm The Baupost Group, shares a similar \nsentiment in his book Margin of Safety:22 \nIt is not clear why investors suddenly came to \naccept EBITDA as a measure of corporate \ncash flow. EBIT did not accurately measure \nthe cash flow from a company\u2018s ongoing \nincome stream. Adding back 100 percent of \ndepreciation and amortization to arrive at \nEBITDA rendered it even less meaningful. \nThose who used EBITDA as a cash-flow proxy, \nfor example, either ignored capital \nexpenditures or assumed that businesses \nwould not make any, perhaps believing that \nplant and equipment do not wear out. \n"

      "text": " \nBL U EM O UN TA IN  INV ES TM E NT RESE A RC H  \n4 \nThere are at least three pitfalls to using EV/EBITDA. \nThe first is that there is not a proper reckoning for \nthe investment needs of the business, the \nconcern that Buffett and Klarman express. Exhibit \n2 shows the adjustments necessary to go from \nEBITDA to unlevered free cash flow. Both EBITDA \nand unlevered free cash flow are financing \nneutral, which means their values are impervious \nto the company\u2019s capital structure. You can \ncompare both figures to enterprise value \nbecause they exclude explicit financing costs, \nalthough EBITDA does not consider investment \nneeds and taxes while free cash flow does. \nThe potential danger in using EBITDA is that it \nunderstates the capital intensity of the business. \nAs a consequence, EBITDA overstates the \namount of cash a company can distribute while \nrunning the operations appropriately. While there \nis a well-placed focus on capital expenditures \nand depreciation, working capital changes and \nacquisitions can also be vital. \nThe second pitfall is that multiples, including \nEV/EBITDA, do not explicitly reflect risk. We are \ninterested here in business risk. Operating \nleverage, the percentage change in operating \nprofit as a function of the percentage change in \nsales, is a suitable measure of business risk. For \ninstance, the operating profit of a business with \nhigh operating leverage is very sensitive to \nchanges in sales, whereas sales changes have a \nmore muted effect on the operating profit for a \nbusiness with low operating leverage.  \nThe final problem has to do with taxes. Two \ncompanies with the same EBITDA and capital \nstructures may pay taxes at dissimilar rates. As a \nresult, the EV/EBITDA multiples will be justifiably \ndifferent. Essentially, the shortcomings of EBITDA \nreflect the items that reconcile EBITDA to free \ncash flow in exhibit 2.  \n \n \n \nExhibit 2: From EBITDA to Unlevered Free Cash Flow \n \nSource: BlueMountain Capital Management. \nEBITDA \n(Earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation, and amortization)\nEBITA\n(Earnings before interest, taxes, \nand amortization) \nDepreciation\nCash taxes\nNOPAT\n(Net operating profit after taxes)\n\u2022 Change in net working capital\n\u2022 Capital expenditures \u2013 depreciation\n\u2022 Acquisitions \u2013 divestitures\nUnlevered free cash flow\n\u2013\n=\n\u2013\n=\n=\nRelates to enterprise value\nCapital intensity\nRelates to enterprise value\nInvestments\n\u2013\n"

      "text": " \nBL U EM O UN TA IN  INV ES TM E NT RESE A RC H  \n5 \nFrom Theory to Practice\u2013Part I\nIn their pathbreaking paper on valuation, Miller \nand Modigliani provide a formula that is core to \nunderstanding value. They say: \nThe value of the firm = steady-state value + future \nvalue creation \nOver the last 60 years, roughly two-thirds of the \nvalue of the S&P 500 price was attributable to \nsteady-state value and the other one-third to \nfuture value creation. Both pieces are \nimportant.23 Appendix A discusses how to model \nbusinesses with declining cash flows.  \nHere\u2019s an intuitive way to think about it.24 Say you \nowned 10 mature and profitable restaurants. \nAssuming the current profits persist for the \nforeseeable future, those restaurants are the \nfoundation for the steady-state value. Now \nconsider the possibility of opening new \nrestaurants that are worth more than they cost to \nbuild. That is future value creation. \nThe important point is that future value creation is \nbased on three elements: finding projects that \ngenerate a positive spread between the return \non invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC), how much you \ncan invest in those projects, and how long you \ncan find those projects in a competitive world.  \nNote that the latter elements, how much and \nhow long, only create value if there is a positive \nspread between ROIC and WACC. If the spread \nis zero, the second term on the right side of the \nequation collapses to zero. Indeed, the second \nterm can be negative if the investments fail to \nearn the cost of capital. \nThis illuminates the critical lesson that you have to \nstart with the spread between ROIC and WACC. \nCalculating ROIC and WACC correctly is a \nprerequisite to doing this analysis appropriately. \nGrowth creates a lot of value only when the \nspread is positive and large, has no effect when \nthe spread is zero, and destroys value when the \nspread is negative. Too many executives and \ninvestors focus on growth without recognizing the \nneed for a positive spread in order to create \nvalue.     \nWe will apply these principles to EV/EBITDA \nmultiples in a moment, but we can start with a \nsimpler example to make the concepts concrete. \nThe body of exhibit 3 is populated with the \nExhibit 3: Warranted P/E Multiple for Various \nAssumptions about ROIC and Growth \n \nSource: BlueMountain Capital Management. \nNote: Assume all equity financed; 8% cost of capital; 15-\nyear forecast period. \ntheoretical P/E\u2019s that are the result of various \nassumptions about return on invested capital, \nwhich you see across the top, and earnings \ngrowth rates, which you see down the left side.25 \nFor simplicity, we have assumed an all-equity \nfinanced business and a cost of capital of 8 \npercent, but as we will see shortly these specific \nassumptions are not critical to the general \nconclusions we can draw.    \nThree points are clear upon examination of the \nP/E\u2019s. The first is if a company earns exactly its \ncost of capital\u2014eight percent in this case\u2014\ngrowth doesn\u2019t matter. The company is on an \neconomic treadmill, so speeding up or slowing \ndown doesn\u2019t matter. The second term on the \nright side of the Miller and Modigliani equation \ncollapses to zero, and all we can count on is the \nsteady-state value. \nWhen returns are above the cost of capital, \ngrowth becomes extremely valuable. For \nexample, when the ROIC is 24 percent, going \nfrom 6 to 10 percent growth lifts the warranted \nP/E ratio from 19 to 26. Companies with a high \nROIC are very sensitive to changes in expected \ngrowth rates.  \nIf a company is investing at a rate below the cost \nof capital, growth is bad. The faster it grows, the \nmore wealth it destroys. You see this when a \ncompany announces an acquisition that adds to \nearnings per share but reduces market \ncapitalization. The market renders its judgment on \nthe deal\u2019s economic value. \nOur task now is to translate these core principles \ninto EV/EBITDA multiples.  \n0.0\n4.0%\n8.0%\n16.0%\n24.0%\n4.0%\n  7.1x\n  12.5x\n  15.2x\n  16.1x\n6.0%\n3.3\n12.5\n17.1\n18.6\n8.0%\nNM\n12.5\n19.4\n21.8\n10.0%\nNM\n12.5\n22.4\n25.7\nReturn on Invested Capital\nEarnings Growth\n"

      "text": " \nBL U EM O UN TA IN  INV ES TM E NT RESE A RC H  \n6 \nFrom Theory to Practice\u2013Part II\nIn order to go from theory to the relevant \nEV/EBITDA multiples, we need to discuss three \ninterrelated topics: capital intensity, return on \ninvested capital, and leverage.  \nLet\u2019s start with capital intensity. At the core of \nBuffett\u2019s and Klarman\u2019s concerns is the fact that \nEBITDA fails to acknowledge a business\u2019s capital \nneeds. We can address this topic empirically \nthrough a detailed study of the capital allocation \npractices of the top 1,500 industrial companies in \nthe U.S. over the last 40 years.26  \nThere are three major forms of investment that \nshow up on the balance sheet: changes in net \nworking capital, capital expenditures minus \ndepreciation, and acquisitions minus divestitures.   \nOverall, net working capital does not demand a \nlot of investment. Net working capital, excluding \ncash, has averaged roughly $220 billion for the \ntop 1,500 industrial companies in the U.S. since \n1980. That said, working capital needs vary a \ngreat deal by sector.  \nIt is useful to analyze a company\u2019s cash \nconversion cycle (CCC), a calculation of how \nlong it takes a company to collect on the sale of \ninventory. The CCC equals days in sales \noutstanding (DSO) plus days in inventory \noutstanding (DIO) less days in payables \noutstanding (DPO). Good working capital \nmanagement is associated with high returns on \ninvested capital.   \nCapital expenditures are a significant investment \nover time, second only to acquisitions in total \ndollars spent. Analysts commonly use \ndepreciation as a proxy for maintenance capital \nexpenditures and fail to consider the investment \nnecessary to support value-creating growth. \nCapital expenditures have averaged about 1.5 \ntimes depreciation for the top 1,500 industrial \ncompanies in the U.S. over the past 4 decades.  \nAcquisitions are by far the largest source of \ninvestment. Here\u2019s a common analytical mistake: \nInvestors extrapolate a historical EBITDA growth \nrate that is in part the result of acquisitions but \ndon\u2019t consider appropriate investments in their \nforecasts. As a result, they underestimate the \ncapital required to achieve that growth. For most \ncompanies, it is proper to forecast organic \ngrowth only and to assume that acquisitions are \nlikely to have little impact on shareholder value.     \nThe global economy continues to shift from \ntangible to intangible assets.27 Companies \ngenerally expense investments in intangible \nassets, including brands and acquired customers, \nwhich is reflected in EBIT. But when an acquirer \nbuys a target, it must reflect tangible and \nintangible assets, as well as goodwill, on its \nbalance sheet. The acquirer must then amortize \nthe intangible assets. As a result, the mix of \u201cDA\u201d \nin EBITDA has been shifting from depreciation to \namortization.28 Exhibit 4 shows that amortization \nwas one-half of 1 percent of depreciation and \namortization in 1980 and is now about 22 \npercent.  \nThe pattern in exhibit 4 reflects two major revisions \nin accounting standards for business \ncombinations. The first, implemented in 2002, \neliminated a method called \u201cpooling of \ninterests,\u201d which allowed companies to simply \ncombine their balance sheets and, as a result, \nsidestep the need to reflect intangible assets on \nthe balance sheet.  \nThe accounting rule also ended the amortization \nof goodwill for those companies using the \npurchase method. The purchase method \nrequired the buyer to record the difference \nbetween the seller\u2019s market value and book \nvalue as goodwill on its balance sheet. This \ngoodwill was then amortized for up to 40 years. \nThe implementation of the standard led to a \nsharp drop in amortization that you see in the \nmiddle of the exhibit.  \nExhibit 4: Amortization As a Percentage of \nDepreciation and Amortization \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT and Bloomberg. \nNote: Top 1,500 U.S. industrial companies. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\nPercent\n"

The sharp rise in amortization is a \nconsequence of these accounting changes, \nrising investment in intangible assets, and a robust \nmarket for mergers and acquisitions.   \nThe amount of depreciation and amortization a \ncompany recognizes is a function of its capital \nintensity, the asset lives it assumes, and its \nacquisitiveness. One useful measure of capital \nintensity is the relationship between EBIT and DA. \nEBIT is a higher percentage of EBITDA for capital-\nlight businesses than for capital-intensive \nbusinesses. \nExhibit 5 shows the contributions of EBIT and DA to \ntotal EBITDA by sector, as well as the EBITDA \nDepreciation Factor, defined as EBITDA/EBIT.29 The \nuniverse is the Russell 3000 excluding companies \nin the financial services and real estate sectors. \nThe top panel shows the median values and the \nbottom panel shows the aggregate values. \nAppendix B shows the same analysis by industry. \nFor some sectors, including consumer staples and \ninformation technology, EBIT is about three-\nquarters of EBITDA. For other sectors, such as \ntelecommunication services and energy, DA is \nthe larger component of EBITDA. Use of EBITDA \ncreates a risk of understating capital intensity for \ncompanies with high EBITDA Depreciation \nFactors. \nThe second topic that provides a bridge from \ntheory to practice is the significance of ROIC. The \ncritical concept is return on incremental invested \ncapital (ROIIC). ROIIC compares the change in \nNOPAT in a given year to the investments made \nin the prior year. For example, if a company\u2019s \nNOPAT increases $200 this year and it invested \n$1,000 last year, the ROIIC is 20 percent \n($200/$1,000).30\nExhibit 5: Contributions of EBIT and DA to Total EBITDA by Sector \n \n \nSource: Bloomberg. \nNote: Data for calendar year 2017; Russell 3000 as of May 31, 2018 excluding financial services and real estate \nsectors and companies with negative EBIT. \n \nUsing Medians\nSector\nEBITDA\nDepreciation Factor\nConsumer Staples\n79\n21\n1.27\nHealth Care\n74\n26\n1.35\nIndustrials\n71\n29\n1.40\nConsumer Discretionary\n70\n30\n1.42\nMaterials\n67\n33\n1.49\nInformation Technology\n66\n34\n1.52\nUtilities\n61\n39\n1.63\nTelecommunication Services\n42\n58\n2.38\nEnergy\n41\n59\n2.42\nUniverse\n67\n33\n1.49\nUsing Aggregates\nSector\nEBITDA\nDepreciation Factor\nConsumer Staples\n77\n23\n1.30\nInformation Technology\n74\n26\n1.35\nIndustrials\n69\n31\n1.45\nHealth Care\n67\n33\n1.49\nConsumer Discretionary\n65\n35\n1.54\nMaterials\n63\n37\n1.59\nUtilities\n55\n45\n1.81\nTelecommunication Services\n45\n55\n2.20\nEnergy\n21\n79\n4.80\nUniverse\n63\n37\n1.59\n                 Percentage of EBITDA\n              EBIT                           DA\n                 Percentage of EBITDA\n              EBIT                           DA\n"

Less spending on \ninvestment means more money for investors. \nAs a result of this, we should expect that industries \nwith low EBITDA Depreciation Factors have higher \nROICs than industries with high EBITDA \nDepreciation Factors. Exhibit 6 shows that this \nrelationship generally holds true. This aligns with \nyour intuition as a businessperson that it is very \ndifficult to generate high ROICs in capital \nintensive industries.   \nThe final topic is leverage. In paper published in \n1958, Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller \nshowed that the value of a firm is independent of \nits capital structure.31 But the invariance principle \ndoes not hold if different capital structures give \nrise to different tax liabilities. In plain terms, \ngreater debt means that more of a company\u2019s \ncash flows go to its claimholders and less go to \nthe government.    \nThe standard way to reflect the value of income \nshielded by interest expense is in the cost of \ncapital. For our discussion, the central point is that \nleverage affects the WACC and not the ROIC.  \nExhibit 6: Relationship between EBITDA \nDepreciation Factor and ROIC \n  \nSource: Bloomberg. \nNote: Aggregated data for industries; calendar year \n2017; universe is Russell 3000 as of May 31, 2018 \nexcluding financial services and real estate sectors and \ncompanies with negative EBIT. \nThe pecking order theory of capital structure says \nthat companies access capital first through \ninternally generated cash, next by raising debt, \nand finally by raising equity.32 Capital intensive \nindustries tend to use more debt financing than \ncapital light industries because they cannot fund \ntheir growth solely through internally generated \ncash.  \nBut the relationship between capital structure \nand ROIC is a little more complicated because \nhigh ROIC businesses can increase leverage, for \nexample by doing a leveraged buyout, but low-\nROIC businesses cannot readily delever. \nBusinesses with high EBITDA Depreciation Factors \ntend to have more debt than those with low \nfactors, but the correlation is not as strong as it is \nfor ROIC. \nWe are now ready for the payoff, exhibit 7, which \nshows the warranted EV/EBITDA multiples \nassuming EBITDA Depreciation Factors of 1.2, 1.5, \nand 1.8. In each case, we have held the debt-to-\ntotal capital ratio constant at 20 percent and the \ncost of capital at 7.2 percent.33 A couple \nobservations are in order. \nAt first blush, it may not be obvious why \ncompanies with the same growth, ROIIC, and \ncost of capital would have different EV/EBITDA \nmultiples, even considering the range of EBITDA \nDepreciation Factors. Indeed, the corporate \nvalues are the same for the matching set of \nassumptions. Here\u2019s the way to think about it. \n\u201cEarnings\u201d on the vertical axis is net operating \nprofit after tax (NOPAT), a term we saw in exhibit \n2. Companies with low EBITDA Depreciation \nFactors don\u2019t need to generate as much EBITDA \nas companies with high EBITDA Depreciation \nFactors to deliver the same amount of NOPAT.  \nHere\u2019s an example. Assuming a 25 percent tax \nrate, a company has to have EBIT of $133.3 to \ngenerate $100 in NOPAT whether its EBITDA \nDepreciation Factor is low or high. For a \ncompany with a 1.2 factor, depreciation and \namortization is $26.7, which means that EBITDA is \n$160 ($160/$133.3 = 1.2). For a company with a \n1.8 factor, depreciation and amortization is \n$133.3, which means that EBITDA is $240 \n($240/$133.3 = 1.8). If you assume that \nincremental returns are equal to the cost of \ncapital for both, their value is $1,389 ($100/7.2%). \nThe low factor company is worth 8.7 times current \nEBITDA and the high factor company is worth 5.8 \ntimes. \n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\nReturn on Invested Capital\nEBITDA Depreciation Factor\nr = -0.44\n"

Exhibit 9 shows \nthat the correlation between the multiples is high \n(r = .79) for a large sample of companies. But \nthere are instances when two companies have \nthe same EV/EBITDA multiple and very different \nP/E multiples, or the same P/E multiple and very \ndifferent EV/EBITDA multiples. Analysts who use \none multiple versus the other or, more \nperniciously, select the multiple that makes their \ninvestment case risk coming to a faulty \nconclusion. \nThe core drivers of all multiples are incremental \nROIC and growth. Two companies with the same \nprospects for ROIC and growth can have \ndifferent relationships between P/E and \nEV/EBITDA because of dissimilar capital structures, \ndifferent tax rates, and reckoning for \nunconsolidated businesses.    \nExhibit 9: Correlation between EV/EBITDA and P/E  \n \nSource: Bloomberg. \nNote: Top 1,500 U.S. industrial companies excluding \nthose with negative EBITDA; as of August 1, 2018; \nwinsorized at 1st and 99th percentiles; scales are \ntruncated for visual purposes; the EV/EBITDA and P/E \nratios are based on consensus estimates for calendar \nyear 2019. \n \n \n \n \nAssumed asset life is an example of an \naccounting choice that can affect multiples. \nImagine two competitors have to spend $1,000 \nfor a machine that is vital to their operations. The \nfirst company assumes the machine will have an \n8-year asset life and uses straight-line \ndepreciation, creating an annual depreciation \nexpense of $125. The second company assumes \na 10-year asset life, generating an annual \nexpense of $100. The earnings of the second \ncompany will be higher than those of the first \neven as the EBITDA is identical. \nA company\u2019s capital structure can also affect \nthe P/E multiple. Consider the simple case of a \ndebt-financed share buyback program, which \nserves to increase leverage by replacing equity \nwith debt in the capital structure. The earnings \nper share impact of the buyback is a function of \nthe P/E multiple and the after-tax cost of new \ndebt. When the inverse of the P/E, E/P, is higher \nthan the after-tax interest expense, a buyback \nadds to earnings per share. Assuming no change \nin price, this lowers the P/E. Note that a \nbuyback\u2019s impact on earnings per share, whether \nit adds to or detracts from the bottom line, is \nindependent of whether it adds to or detracts \nfrom value. \nTwo companies with matching ROIC and growth \nprospects, accounting policies, and capital \nstructures may still have different multiples as the \nresult of a higher or lower tax rate. (Tax rates are \nalso relevant for ROIC, but the effect goes \nbeyond that.) Lower tax rates increase enterprise \nvalue and earnings but have no effect on EBITDA.  \nFinally, some companies have unconsolidated \nbusinesses or cross holdings that may factor into a \ncalculation of enterprise value but can distort \nearnings or EBITDA.

Investing \nin credit or equity demands a thorough analysis \nof cash flows and an understanding of what \nthose cash flows imply about value.  \nTruth be told, most analysts use a multiple to \nassign a price to a company. Aswath \nDamodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern \nSchool of Business at New York University and a \nleading expert in valuation, offers the following: \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with pricing. But it\u2019s not \nvaluation. Valuation is about digging through \na business, understanding the business, \nunderstanding its cash flows, growth, and risk, \nand then trying to attach a number to a \nbusiness based on its value as a business. \nMost people don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not their job. \nThey price companies. So the biggest mistake \nin valuation is mistaking pricing for \nvaluation.35     \nBased on this discussion, here are five ideas to \nbear in mind:  \n\uf0b7 \nEvidence shows that buying a stock at a \npremium to its warranted multiple leads \nto poor excess returns and buying at a \ndiscount leads to attractive excess \nreturns.36 For example, Dan Rasmussen, \nfounder and portfolio manager of \nVerdad Advisers, highlights analysis that \nsuggests more than one-half of private \nequity deals done at an EV/EBITDA  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmultiple of 10 times or higher lost money, \nand that for every dollar put into these \ndeals investors got only a tad more than \na dollar out.37 There is nothing magical \nabout 10 times. The essential point is \nbusinesses have different warranted \nmultiples that are important to \nunderstand as you buy and sell their \nsecurities. \n\uf0b7 \nUse of various valuation approaches can \nguide you toward a central tendency of \nvalue. Research in the forecasting \nliterature shows that combining forecasts \nderived from different methods can \nreduce error and yield more accurate \npredictions.38 \n\uf0b7 \nYou don\u2019t want your embedded \nassumptions to be unmoored from the \nfundamental drivers of value. Before \napplying an EV/EBITDA multiple, be sure \nto consider the key drivers of value.39 \nWhile simple, the matrices in exhibit 7 can \nserve as a sanity check for your valuation \nwork. \n\uf0b7 \nThe vocal critics of EBITDA may be \noverstating their case, but the risk of \nunderestimating the capital required to \ngrow is real. Make sure you consider \ncarefully what capital needs a company \ntruly has to make sure that cash flow \nprojections are not illusory.  \n\uf0b7 \nIf you use EBITDA as the terminal value in \na discounted cash flow model, use the \naverage multiple over a cycle. You may \nintroduce a substantial error if you rely on \nend-of-period economic assumptions.40 \n"

Miller, \u201cThe Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of \nInvestment,\u201d American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 3, June 1958, 261-297. \n33 The companies with higher EBITDA Depreciation Factors would, on average, have higher debt-to-\ntotal capitalization ratios. But if you assume an increase in the cost of equity and cost of debt and \nreweight the contributions, the net difference is not meaningful. The main point is return on invested \ncapital and growth largely determine valuation.

Merrill Lynch says our valuation is all about \nEBITDA, not earnings.\u201d \nEBITDA. A fancy Wall Street term for profits, with all of the financial expenses removed. It stood for \n\u201cearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\u201d Steady growth in EBITDA could be a \nsign of future strong profits, but not if it was being accomplished by manufacturing full, after-tax losses. \n[Ken] Lay couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Was [Rebecca] Mark really arguing that the deeper \ninto a hole she got, the better off her company would be? \n\u201cRebecca, that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said. \u201cSurely you understand that if you put capital into \nprojects with returns that are below the cost of that capital, ultimately you\u2019re going to go bankrupt.\u201d \n\u201cThis is what Merrill tells me is the way things are around this industry,\u201d Mark replied. \u201cWe have to grow \nEBITDA.
