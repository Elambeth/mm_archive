      "text": " \n \nMay 12, 2015 \n \nIQ versus RQ \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nKeith Stanovich, a professor of applied psychology at the University of Toronto, distinguishes between \nintelligence quotient (IQ) and rationality quotient (RQ).2 Psychologists measure IQ through specific tests, \nincluding the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and it correlates highly with standardized tests such as the \nSAT.3 \n \nIQ measures something real, and it is associated with certain outcomes. For example, thirteen-year-old \nchildren who scored in the top decile of the top percent (99.9th percentile) on the math section of the SAT \nwere eighteen times more likely to earn a doctorate degree in math or science than children who scored in the \nbottom decile of the top percent (99.1st percentile).4 \n \nRQ is the ability to think rationally and, as a consequence, to make good decisions. Whereas we generally \nthink of intelligence and rationality as going together, Stanovich\u2019s work shows that the correlation coefficient \nbetween IQ and RQ is relatively low at .20 to .35.5 IQ tests are not designed to capture the thinking that leads \nto judicious decisions.     \n \nStanovich laments that almost all societies are focused on intelligence when the costs of irrational behavior are \nso high. But you can pick out the signatures of rational thinking if you are alert to them. According to \nStanovich, they include adaptive behavioral acts, efficient behavioral regulation, sensible goal prioritization, \nreflectivity, and the proper treatment of evidence.6 \n \nYour SAT scores shed little light on any of these qualities. So the first lesson in assessing your own decisions \nor those of others is to consider IQ and RQ separately. Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer \n(CEO) of Berkshire Hathaway, equates IQ to the horsepower of an engine and RQ to the output. We all know \npeople who are high on IQ but average or low on RQ. Their efficiency is poor. There are others without \ndazzling IQs but who consistently make sound decisions. They are highly efficient. \n \nWarren Buffett has plenty of horsepower and output. But when asked about his success, Buffett emphasized \nthat it was RQ that made the big difference, not IQ:7   \n \nHow I got here is pretty simple in my case. It's not IQ, I\u2019m sure you'll be glad to hear. The big thing is \nrationality. I always look at IQ and talent as representing the horsepower of the motor, but that the \noutput\u2014the efficiency with which that motor works\u2014depends on rationality. A lot of people start out \nwith 400-horsepower motors but only get a hundred horsepower of output. It\u2019s way better to have a \n200-horsepower motor and get it all into output.  \n \nStanovich\u2019s psychological research supports Buffett\u2019s observation. While there is not yet a comprehensive test \nto measure RQ\u2014Stanovich is working on it\u2014we will look at calibration, one of the important facets of \nrationality.8 As part of this research, we measured the calibration of thousands of people. And part of the fun \nis that you, too, can participate in the exercise and see how you stack up versus others.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 12, 2015 \n \nIQ versus RQ \n3 \nMeasuring Rationality  \n \nCognitive scientists and philosophers talk about \u201cinstrumental\u201d and \u201cepistemic\u201d rationality. Instrumental \nrationality is behaving in such a way that you get what you want the most, subject to constraints. Expected \nutility theory, which is based on a series of axioms, provides a normative framework for how to do this. You\u2019ll \nbe instrumentally rational if you follow the axioms.9 \n \nEpistemic rationality describes how well a person\u2019s beliefs map onto the world. If you believe in the tooth fairy, \nfor instance, you are showing a lack of epistemic rationality. Here\u2019s a catchier way to remember the two \nterms: instrumental rationality is \u201cwhat to do\u201d and epistemic rationality is \u201cwhat is true.\u201d10   \n \nWe will focus on observations about epistemic rationality. One way to assess this form of rationality is through \na test of calibration. Think of a weather forecaster. If it actually rains 70 percent of the time on the days she \npredicts a 70 percent chance of rain, she is well calibrated. She is poorly calibrated, on the other hand, if it \nonly rains on 30 percent of those days.  \n \nExhibit 1 shows one approach to keeping score. The horizontal axis measures an individual\u2019s subjective \nforecast (\u201cthere\u2019s a 70 percent chance of rain tomorrow\u201d) and the vertical axis captures the actual outcome (\u201cit \nrained\u201d). You know that someone is well calibrated if their results fall close to the line at a 45-degree angle.     \n \nExhibit 1: Measure of Calibration \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.  \n \nConviction is another important consideration. Conviction measures how well people do when they assign \nextreme probabilities.11 Calibration and conviction are related but distinct. For example, it rains about half of \nthe days in an average year in London. So if you wake up every morning, flip a fair coin, and mark your \noutcome, you will appear well calibrated over one year. \n \nBut that doesn\u2019t help you plan picnics. What you want are a series of predictions for sun or rain that \ncorrespond with the actual weather that day. Those predictions require higher conviction than what the toss of \na coin can offer. Exhibit 2 shows perfect calibration but poor conviction on the left, and perfect calibration and \nconviction on the right.  \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%100%\nObjective Probability\nSubjective Probability\nLine of perfect calibration\n"

Following his ouster, the \nretailer returned to many of its past practices.16  \n \nAnother problem is that people who think that they know more than they do are less motivated to learn and \nimprove than those who understand their limitations.17 Indeed, one study showed that the least capable people \nhave the largest gap between what they think they can do and what they actually achieve.18 \n \nLessons for Investors and Executives \n \nThe good news in all of this is that we can train ourselves to be more rational. Here are some ideas: \n \uf402\n Keep score. To the degree to which you can pose questions that will have a definite answer within a \nknown period of time, you have a basis for keeping score. The classic way to do this is through a Brier \nscore, which we discuss in detail in the appendix. Brier scores were originally developed to help give \nmeteorologists feedback on their predictions for the weather. Through improvements in weather modeling \ntechniques and sharper feedback, meteorologists today are vastly more accurate than they were a \ngeneration or two ago.19  \n \uf402\n Ask about others. Emily Pronin, a professor of psychology at Princeton University, has found that while \npeople recognize biases in the thinking of others, they somehow think that they suffer less from the \nsame biases.20 For example, physicians know that gifts from pharmaceutical companies have biasing \neffects for other doctors but believe they are immune from the effect. \n \nHere\u2019s a technique to deal with this. Say you are an investor interviewing a company\u2019s management \nteam, and you are considering buying the stock. You should know that the management team will have \nan optimism bias, and so you have to take what they say with a grain of salt. But their views about other \ncompanies are more likely to be accurate. In other words, don\u2019t ask people about themselves, ask them \nabout others.   \n \uf402\n Use base rates. Perhaps the single most effective de-biasing tool is the use of base rates.21 While we \nall like to think of ourselves as unique, asking what happened when others were in the same situation \ncan be very helpful. Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard University and Secretary of the \nTreasury of the U.S., had a rule he used with his research assistants. He would ask how long a project \nwould take. And then he would take the assistant\u2019s answer, double the estimate, and move up to the \nnext unit of time.22 So \u201ctwo hours\u201d would be translated as \u201cfour days.\u201d Perhaps this was simply a \nmechanism to avoid disappointment, but the direction of the new estimate was no doubt correct. \n \uf402\n Update probabilities. The test we shared with the participants was static. In the real world, probabilities \nshift all of the time. One of the key challenges in rational thinking is to accurately update probabilities as \nnew information arrives. It turns out that the very best forecasters do this very well and use very granular \nincrements of probability.23 Most of us fall into the trap of confirmation bias, preferring to disregard or \ndiscount new information than to properly incorporate it into our assessment.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 12, 2015 \n \nIQ versus RQ \n10 \nLimitations to This Project \n \nWhile this project was fun and revealed results that are consistent with past research, we want to be quick to \nnote that this work does not meet the standard of academic research for a few reasons.  \n \nTo begin, we can define overconfidence in multiple ways.24 The primary form of overconfidence that this test \ncaptures is overestimation\u2014you think you\u2019re right 70 percent of the time but you\u2019re only right 60 percent\u2014\nbut overprecision, the tendency to provide ranges of outcomes that are too narrow, also plays a role. Suffice it \nto say that overconfidence has no simple definition and hence there\u2019s no uniform way to test it. \n \nHow our participants answered also reflected the questions we posed. We attempted to have questions that \nwere varied, but it is likely that an individual may have a different result for a separate set of questions. In \nother words, an individual\u2019s results might vary from test to test based on the nature of the questions.   \n \nOur default percentages were in increments of 10 percentage points, which limited the ability of the \nparticipants to provide greater subtlety in their responses. This may have also encouraged the result of the \nextremes\u2014lots of 50 and 100 percent answers. \n \nFinally, we may have a biased sample of test takers. Most entered the site after having seen it mentioned in \nsocial media communication. Participants from four countries constituted more than three-fourths of the \nsample, including 37 percent from the U.S., 21 percent from Australia, 15 percent from the Netherlands, and \n5 percent from the U.K. Nearly all participants took the test on one of four operating systems, including 40 \npercent on Windows, 27 percent on iOS, 15 percent on Mac OS, and 14 percent on Android.  \n \nCharacteristics of People with High RQ \n \nAs part of a large-scale forecasting project, researchers have identified the characteristics of the very best \nforecasters.25 They break down the skills into three variables: dispositional, situational, and behavioral. We \nbelieve these are consistent with high RQ. Here are some highlights: \n \uf402\n Dispositional \n\uf02d Engage in inductive reasoning \n\uf02d Exhibit cognitive control26 \n\uf02d Comfortable with numerical reasoning \n\uf02d Actively open-minded \n\uf02d Have a limited need for closure \n \uf402\n Situational \n\uf02d Trained in probabilistic reasoning (understand base rates) \n\uf02d Effective working as part of a team \n \uf402\n Behavioral \n\uf02d Growth (versus fixed) mindset27 \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 12, 2015 \n \nIQ versus RQ \n11 \nAppendix: Keeping Score with Brier  \n \nPsychologists commonly use the Brier score as a method for gauging the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts. \nGlenn Brier, a meteorologist, developed the score in the 1950s.28 In its simplest form, the Brier score \nmeasures the square of the forecast error, or (forecast \u2212 outcome)2. For binary events, the value of the \noutcome is 1 if the event occurs and 0 if it does not. As in golf, a lower score is better. \n \nYou can express a Brier score either on a scale of 0 to 1, or 0 to 2, depending on the calculation. We follow \nBrier\u2019s original approach and place our results on a scale of 0 to 2. When calculating the Brier score this way, \nyou consider the squared forecast error for both the event and the non-event. \n \nExhibit 8 shows a meteorologist\u2019s probabilistic forecasts for whether it will rain over the next four days. For \nexample, on Day 2, she forecasts an 80 percent probability that it will rain. Likewise, we can say she \nforecasts a 20 percent probability that it will not rain. Because it did rain, we place a 1 in the outcome column \nbelow \u201cRain\u201d and a 0 in the \u201cNo Rain\u201d column. Her Brier score for that day was 0.08. For multiple forecasts, \nthe overall Brier score is the mean of the scores for each forecast. The meteorologist\u2019s overall Brier score \ncomes to 0.25. \n \nExhibit 8: Distribution of Subjective Probability of Correctness \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nThe scale from 0 to 2 has a nice feature.
