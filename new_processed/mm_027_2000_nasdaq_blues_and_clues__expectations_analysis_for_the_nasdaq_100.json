We believe our\nproprietary valuation work offers unique insight into market expectations.\nUnderstanding current expectations, and the revisions in those expectations over\nthe past 8 months, provides investors with the necessary calibration to make\nforward-looking investment decisions.\nValue is driven by the future cash flows discounted to a present value at an\nappropriate discount rate. We can segregate cash flow forecasts into three\npieces: a base level of earnings, future growth in earnings, and reinvestment\nneeds. Given that the Nasdaq 100 is largely comprised of capital efficient,\nknowledge-based companies, capital efficiency plays a very limited role in the\nsharp expectations revisions. However base earnings, as well as anticipated\nearnings growth and discount rates are all worthy of discussion. Our analysis\nshows the following:\n\u2022 \nSince the end of March, 2001 earnings estimates (based on rolling First Call\nforecasts) have been trimmed about 8%. Earnings estimates rose modestly\nfrom year-end 1999 through March. This reduction in earnings represents\n25% of the Nasdaq\u2019s correction, by our calculations.\n\u2022 \nExpectations for future earnings growth rates have dropped about 300 basis\npoints, from just under 22% to about 18.5%, since March. This is by far the\nmost important driver of value. We estimate that about 50% of the Nasdaq\u2019s\ndecline is due to this reduction. Since most companies in the index are so-\ncalled new economy companies, and hence capital efficient, they are\nextremely sensitive to growth.\n\u2022 \nWe figure that the discount rate has increased about 150 basis points, to\nroughly 14%, since the end of the first quarter. Given the general concerns\nabout the sector, it is no surprise that investors require a higher return to\nparticipate. This increase is the final 25% of the index\u2019s drop.\nWhile this disaggregation sheds some light on past results, the real question is\nwhat will happen in the future. Here are some sensitivities that can help in this\nassessment:\n\u2022 \nA future 10% change in aggregate composite earnings equals about a 10%\nchange in the index.\n\u2022 \nA 1-percentage point (100 basis point) change in the expected growth rate\nequates to a 10% delta in the index.\n\u2022 \nA 50 basis point change in discount rate represents about a 7% shift in the\nindex value.\nIn times of turmoil, it is important to go back to basics. Our analysis provides a\nclear look at the market\u2019s current expectations for the Nasdaq, and shows where\nthe points of sensitivity lie. While this is an aggregate view, it provides important\ncontext for understanding past performance and anticipating the impact of future\nexpectations revisions.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager\nor co-manager of a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies\nmentioned.\n"
