Yet there is powerful evidence that once a company\u2019s core business has \nmatured, the pursuit of new platforms for growth entails daunting risk. Roughly one \ncompany in ten is able to sustain the kind of growth that translates into an above-\naverage increase in shareholder returns over more than a few years. . . . \nConsequently, most executives are in a no-win situation: equity markets demand that \nthey grow, but it\u2019s hard to know how to grow.  \nClayton M.

Chan, Jason Karceski, and Josef Lakonishok\nThe Level and Persistence of Growth Rates 2\nWhy Big Fierce Animals are Rare \nOn the surface, the size and frequency distribution for species, cities, and company \nsizes may not seem like they would have a lot in common. Yet each follows a power \nlaw, which looks like a straight line when plotted on a log-log scale. Power laws \nindicate that there are lots of small occurrences and very few large ones. 3 In nature, \nthere are lots of ants\u2014the combined weight of ants is larger than the combined weight \nof humans\u2014but very few elephants. Similarly, we have many small companies and a \nmodest number of huge ones.

      "text": "    Page 2 \nTake species for a moment. Why are large carnivorous animals, like tigers, relatively rare, while small \nanimals, like termites, are so abundant? Ecologists answer by pointing out that all animals have a \nniche\u2014not just a physical location, but a real place in the grand scheme of things. A species must not \nonly survive in its home, it must successfully interact with the other plant and animal species that \nshare that home.  \nThe niche idea, though, still doesn\u2019t explain why the distribution of species looks the way it does. That \ninsight came from Oxford\u2019s Charles Elton, who noted that larger animals need smaller animals to \nsustain them. (Animals rarely prey on animals larger than they are.) So, Elton reasoned, with every \nincrement in body size, there should be an associated loss in numbers. He called this fact of life \u201cThe \nPyramid of Numbers.\u201d Big fierce animals are rare because they have less sources of energy than \nsmaller animals. 4 The species power law distribution is a natural outcome of interacting animals \nconstrained by the laws of physics. 5 \nWhat does this have to do with the stock market? Investors should pay attention to these distributions \nfor three reasons. First, companies, like species, fit into niches. Thinking about these niches and how \nthey change can provide some insight into a company\u2019s growth potential.  \nSecond, a strong body of evidence shows that the variance of growth rates is smaller for large firms \nthan for small firms (even though the median growth rate is fairly stable across the population). \nFurther, growth for large companies often stalls, leading to marked share price underperformance as \ninvestors recalibrate their expectations.  \nFinally, investors often extrapolate past growth rates into the future, leading to disappointing \nshareholder returns for those companies that cannot meet those expectations. Investors who are \naware of patterns of growth may be able to avoid unfavorable expectations gaps. \nFind Your Niche \nThe idea that companies find niches is certainly not new. For example, many aspects of the \ncompetitive strategy literature in general, and game theory in particular, address how and why \ncompanies should seek profitable niches. The main message here is that the environment, and hence \nniches, change over time as the result of technological developments, regulatory shifts, and industry \nexit and entry.  \nThink of mini-mills versus integrated steel companies, or Internet-based retailers compared to brick-\nand-mortar competitors. New niches open, and new companies exploit them. A company\u2019s ability to \nadapt to a changing environment is critical\u2014and the number of companies that can do so is small.   \nAs a result, optimal firm size may not be fixed for a particular industry, and comparing the valuations of \ncompanies with different economic models doesn\u2019t make sense.  \nDear CEO\u2014We\u2019ve Made It to the Fortune 50! You\u2019re Fired \nStudies of firm size distributions and growth rates reveal four stylized facts: \n1. Firm size distributions follow Zipf\u2019s Law (a specific class of power law). 6 What is crucial for \ninvestors is that this distribution is very robust in the face of significant economic change. This \nmeans that the proportion of very large companies to smaller companies is unlikely to vary \nmuch in the future. \n2. Variances of firm growth rates decrease with size. 7 Our analysis suggests that median growth \nrates are stable across a large sample of U.S. public companies (sales of $100 million or \nmore), but that the variance in growth narrows substantially. (See Exhibit 2.) On one level, this \nobservation is common sense\u2014large companies represent a substantial percentage of GDP, \nso it\u2019s unlikely that they will outstrip it to any meaningful degree. (The Fortune 50 represent \nover 25 percent of GDP.) Yet companies that launch into the Fortune 50 are often those that \nhave realized strong past growth, setting up a potential investor expectations mismatch. \nThis empirical finding is consistent with stochastic models similar to Gibrat\u2019s Law. This law, \nalso known as the law of proportionate effect, says that a firm\u2019s growth rate is independent of \nits size. With some modifications, applying Gibrat\u2019s Law to a sample of companies generates \na Zipf distribution. Classical microeconomics has no satisfactory models to explain these \nfindings. 8 \n"

The growth for large companies often stalls. This was the conclusion of a detailed study by the \nCorporate Strategy Board. 9 The research argued that once companies reach a sufficient sales \nlevel, they see their growth rate stall. That stall level has risen over the decades, but looked to \nbe in the $20-30 billion area in the late 1990s.   \nExhibit 3 shows the average annual growth rate for companies entering into the Fortune 50 (a \nranking based on sales). The data show that companies often enjoy strong growth rates prior to \nmaking the top 50 but tend to have rather anemic growth once they attain that group. The high \ngrowth rate in the first year suggests that acquisitions catapult many companies into the \nFortune 50. \nExhibit 3: Average Annual Growth Rate for Companies Entering Fortune 50 \n15.0%\n9.5%\n9.0%\n13.5%\n20.0%\n28.6%\n2.0% 1.4%\n-0.7% -0.7%\n0.7% 1.2%\n0.1%\n2.1% 2.8%\n5.1% 4.5%\n-1.6%\n-0.1%\n-3.9%\n-5.0%\n0.0%\n5.0%\n10.0%\n15.0%\n20.0%\n25.0%\n30.0%\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nYears from Entrance into Fortune 50\nAverage Annual Growth Rate \n(GNP-Deflated)\n15.0%\n9.5%\n9.0%\n13.5%\n20.0%\n28.6%\n2.0% 1.4%\n-0.7% -0.7%\n0.7% 1.2%\n0.1%\n2.1% 2.8%\n5.1% 4.5%\n-1.6%\n-0.1%\n-3.9%\n-5.0%\n0.0%\n5.0%\n10.0%\n15.0%\n20.0%\n25.0%\n30.0%\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nYears from Entrance into Fortune 50\nAverage Annual Growth Rate \n(GNP-Deflated)\n \nSource:  Corporate Strategy Board, Stall Points: Barriers to Growth for the Large Corporate Enterprise, 1998, page 15. \n4. Most industries follow an identifiable life cycle.10 Early on, an industry tends to see substantial \ngrowth and entry, then meaningful exit and high economic returns (for the survivors), followed \nby gradual growth deceleration. In mature stages, companies have muted growth and economic \nreturns close to competitive equilibrium. Large companies tend to be mature companies. \nAdvising companies what to do in the face of slowing growth is an industry in and of itself. It is true that \nlarge companies have a difficult time innovating as successfully as smaller companies for a host of \nreasons. We enthusiastically recommend a new book by Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor, The \nInnovator\u2019s Solution, which provides managers with a useful innovation framework. But the reality is that \nnot all companies can grow rapidly forever. \n"

      "text": "    Page 4 \nExtrapolative Expectations \nA review of the evidence on firm size and growth rates suggests investors should temper their growth \nexpectations as companies get large. But the reality is that investors tend to extrapolate the recent past, \nand hence miss declining growth rates. According to Chan, Karceski, and Lakonishok: \nMarket valuation ratios have little ability to sort out firms with high future growth from firms with low \ngrowth. Instead, in line with the extrapolative expectations hypothesis, investors tend to key on past \ngrowth. Firms that have achieved high growth in the past fetch high valuations, while firms with low past \ngrowth are penalized with poor valuations. 11 \nData from the Corporate Strategy Board support this point. Its multidecade study shows that roughly \ntwo-thirds of the companies that hit the stall point lose 50 percent or more of their market value (relative \nto the Dow Jones Industrial Average) within a decade. Ninety-five percent underperform the DJIA by 25 \npercent or more. \nWe asked a similar, simple question: How would an equal-weighted portfolio of the Fortune 50, \npurchased at year-end, fare versus the S&P 500 in the subsequent 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods? We ran \nthe numbers from 1980 through 2002 and found that for each holding period, the S&P 500 \noutperformed the Fortune 50 portfolio. (See Exhibit 4.) Again, it\u2019s hard for the largest companies to \nmeaningfully outperform the market because they are such a large percentage of the market. \nExhibit 4: Total Shareholder Return\u2014Fortune 50 Versus S&P 500 \nFortune 50\nS&P 500\n1-Year TSR\n14.3%\n13.8%\n3-Year TSR\n15.0%\n13.5%\n5-Year TSR\n15.9%\n14.3%\nFortune 50\nS&P 500\n1-Year TSR\n14.3%\n13.8%\n3-Year TSR\n15.0%\n13.5%\n5-Year TSR\n15.9%\n14.3%\nSource:  Factset, Ibottson, CSFB analysis. \nWe also looked at a very simple valuation measure, market capitalization-to-sales, to see if the largest \ncompanies stood out. And indeed they do. The current average market cap-to-sales ratio for the top 50 \ncompanies is 0.9, the lowest of any decile in the top 500. The average ratio for the 500 largest sales \ncompanies is 1.2. Not only did the largest companies have the lowest market-cap-to\u2013sales ratios, the \nstandard deviation of those ratios was much lower than those of other deciles. Neither premium \nvaluations nor premium growth are easy to come by for the largest companies. \nNone of this is to say that current valuations for the largest companies does not still embed healthy \nexpectations. Based on CSFB HOLT aggregated data, the 50 largest U.S. companies by market \ncapitalization reflect growth and return on investment expectations that are substantially higher than \nthose for the S&P 500 in total. 12  \nAnother way to look at expectations is to break down the percentage of shareholder value that comes \nfrom assets in place versus the value attributable to future investments. Today, one-half of the value of \nthe twenty largest U.S. companies is on the come. 13 (See Exhibit 5.)  \n"
