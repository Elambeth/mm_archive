After the market closed on June 7, ConAgra Inc (now \nConagra Brands) announced it was acquiring the food operations \nof Beatrice Company. These included popular products such as \nPeter Pan peanut butter and Orville Redenbacher popcorn that \ngave Conagra access to a section of the supermarket where it had \nno presence.1   \nKohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (now KKR & Co.) had taken \nBeatrice private for more than $8 billion in 1986, then the largest \nleveraged buyout in history. KKR quickly sold most of the \nconglomerate\u2019s divisions, including Avis Car Rental, Coca-Cola \nBottling, and Tropicana. There were a lot of lookers, but no takers, \nfor the food business at the price KKR sought.2 \nThe assets that remained at Beatrice were desirable, but the \naccounting for the purchase made it \u201csomething of a white \nelephant.\u201d3 Under purchase accounting, the buyer would have to \nassume $2.4 billion in \u201cunallocated purchase cost,\u201d effectively \ngoodwill, that it would have to amortize over 40 years. This meant \nan accounting charge against earnings of nearly $60 million per \nyear that most companies preferred to avoid.4  \nBeatrice sold for $1.34 billion and the assumption of about $1 \nbillion in debt, less than one-half of what KKR had hoped for \noriginally. But Conagra structured the payment to be tax efficient \nfor the sellers, and the annualized return on the equity in the \nBeatrice LBO was reported to be as high as 50 percent.5 \nConagra arranged for information packets about the deal to be \ndelivered to Wall Street analysts after the close of the market (this \nwas before the dawn of the commercial internet). The senior \nanalyst handed me the packet as he headed out the door and \nasked me to do the analysis. He indicated he would update his \nthoughts on the stock at the morning call the next day. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Beatrice appeared to be a good strategic fit for Conagra, and the cash flows \nshowed that the deal created value for shareholders despite the potential impact of goodwill amortization. \nIndeed, Conagra\u2019s management correctly understood goodwill amortization as an accounting rather than an \neconomic cost.6 \nThe senior analyst came in the next morning and said he was downgrading the stock based on his experience. \nHe was a Wall Street veteran and recognized a pattern. There were two things that made him pessimistic about \nthe stock\u2019s potential reaction to the news: the fact it was an acquisition and the possible drag on earnings from \namortization. Most merger and acquisition (M&A) deals fail to create value for the acquiring company, and a hit \nto earnings is perceived to be bad. \nConagra\u2019s stock rose about 4 percent that day and the S&P 500 fell roughly 1 percent. The S&P 500 is an index \nthat tracks the stocks of 500 of the largest companies listed in the U.S. \nThis report is about the powers and perils of pattern recognition. Investors and investment organizations \nregularly cite pattern recognition as the basis for action.7 While it can be extremely powerful and useful when \napplied appropriately, it can also be highly misleading and furnish fuel for overconfidence when used \ninappropriately. \nWe will define pattern recognition, discuss when it tends to work well, review why it may be misleading, and offer \nsome ways to help improve it.   \nDefinition \nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines \u201cpattern\u201d as \u201ca reliable sample of traits, acts, tendencies, or other \nobservable characteristics of a person, group, or institution\u201d and \u201crecognize\u201d as \u201cto acknowledge or take notice \nof in some definite way.\u201d8 So pattern recognition is an awareness that what is happening now has happened in \nthe past and offers a predictable sense of what\u2019s going to happen in the future. Investors with experience \ncommonly sense they recognize patterns because they have a mental database of events and outcomes.   \nPattern recognition works at the intersection of intuition and expertise.9 Intuition is the immediate sense of \nunderstanding something without conscious thought. In fact, Herbert Simon, a polymath who made major \ncontributions to computer science, economics, and cognitive psychology, stated flatly that, \u201cIntuition is nothing \nmore and nothing less than recognition.\u201d10 \nExpertise can be described as \u201cconsistently superior performance on a specified set of representative tasks for \na domain.\u201d11 Becoming an expert generally requires devoting a large amount of time to deliberate practice in an \nenvironment where there is unambiguous feedback. Experts perceive patterns in their domains, solve problems \nqualitatively, and answer problems much faster and represent them at a deeper level when compared to \nnovices.12 \nThe words experience and expertise share the same Latin root, but distinguishing between them is crucial. \nGregory Northcraft, a social psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois, suggests the \nfollowing difference: \u201cThere are a lot of areas where people who have experience think they\u2019re experts, but the \ndifference is that experts have predictive models, and people who have experience have models that aren\u2019t \nnecessarily predictive.\u201d13  \n"

In instances \nwhen there is wiggle room in assessing the quality of decisions, those with experience may talk a better game \nthan those without experience but offer judgments that are in the aggregate no better than average.14 Expertise \napplies under a relatively narrow set of conditions.  \nWork on expert political judgment by Phil Tetlock, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, \nmakes this point emphatically.15 Tetlock had 284 experts make a total of 28,000 predictions associated with \npolitical and economic outcomes from 1984 to 2003. A majority of Tetlock\u2019s participants had doctorate degrees, \nand on average they had more than a dozen years of work experience. He defined an expert as someone who \nmakes a living by providing advice regarding political or economic trends.  \nThe forecasts by the experts were little better than chance and usually worse than those produced by simple \nextrapolation algorithms. Further, he found that predictions by the participants were commonly based on \u201ccase-\nspecific hunches about causality that make some scenarios more \u2018imaginable\u2019 than others.\u201d16 They had \nexperience but lacked predictive models that were accurate. \nTetlock\u2019s description of how the experts he studied came up with forecasts appears very similar to what investors \ndo. For example, a survey of more than 250 holders of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation, more than \nhalf of whom had 15 years or more of experience, revealed that 92 percent agreed with the statement, \u201cThe \nability to construct a coherent and complete \u2018story\u2019 with the facts of a situation is the most important task when \nmaking a decision or recommendation.\u201d17  \nHeuristics and biases are a central area of research in cognitive psychology. Heuristics are mental shortcuts, or \nrules of thumb, that people use to make judgments. In general, heuristics are useful because they are fast and \noften accurate. But heuristics can lead to biases, or departures from an ideal decision-making process.18 \nTetlock\u2019s participants and the CFA charterholders both appear to use the representativeness heuristic. This is \nwhen a decision maker anticipates what will happen next based on an event, or events, that appear \nrepresentational of the situation under consideration. This allows a forecaster to craft a compelling story. This \nheuristic is a form of intuition that introduces bias when events are not as correlated as the decision maker \nperceives. \nResearch shows that both intuition and expertise work in some settings and fail in others.19 Understanding where \nand why intuition and expertise are effective is essential for knowing when pattern recognition is effective.    \nWhen Does Pattern Recognition Work? \nGary Klein is a psychologist who is one of the leading advocates for the role of expert intuition in decision \nmaking.20 Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, has \nshown how decisions based on intuition commonly depart from normative economic theory, especially in realms \nof uncertainty and risk.21 The two got together and worked on what Kahneman called his \u201cmost satisfying \nexperience\u201d in adversarial collaboration, defined as \u201ca good-faith effort to conduct debates by carrying out joint \nresearch.\u201d22 \nThey found that intuitive expertise and pattern recognition tend to work well in stable environments where cause \nand effect are clear and participants can receive timely and accurate feedback. The classic example is chess. \nSkilled chess players can rapidly see which side of the board has an advantage and often quickly identify optimal, \n"

Chess masters, roughly the top one percent of rated players, recognize telling \npatterns on the board based on groups of pieces, called \u201cchunks.\u201d A chunk is effectively a unit of information \nthat allows an expert to absorb lots of accurate cues about the game.23 \nIf stability and feedback are essential to successful pattern recognition, instability and unclear links between \ncause and effect show where pattern recognition fails. Robin Hogarth, a cognitive psychologist, distinguishes \nbetween \u201ckind\u201d and \u201cwicked\u201d environments. In kind environments, outcomes are indicative of the quality of the \nprocess and feedback is accurate and plentiful. In wicked environments, outcomes are a poor or misleading \nreflection of process because causal links are blurred.24  \nExpert agreement is one way to assess the validity of intuitive expertise.25 In kind environments, experts tend to \nagree on cues and the appropriate decisions that follow. For example, chess masters are likely to identify similar \nmoves as attractive.  \nIn wicked environments, the views of experts often vary substantially. For instance, the one-year forecasts of \nthe level of long-term interest rates by economists are not much different from random.26 Predictions of stock \nmarket returns by strategists and executives also tend to be poor.27 \nJames Shanteau, a professor of psychology, summarizes the conditions for good and poor expert performance \n(see exhibit 1). In reality, you can think of expert performance across a continuum, from excellent to close to \nrandom. Shanteau adds some other relevant considerations. One is access to decision support systems. For \ninstance, weather forecasters make very accurate short-term forecasts and largely agree with one another \nbecause they use sophisticated models that predict atmospheric conditions. But strategists or economists with \nequal credentials will have varying views on the probability of a recession or the price of oil one year from now.  \nExhibit 1: Characteristics for Good and Poor Expert Performance \nProperty characteristic \nGood performance \nPoor performance \nStimulus stability \nStatic \nDynamic \nType of decision \nPhysical system \nBehavioral system \nExperts agree on cues \nYes \nNo \nDomain context \nPredictable \nUnpredictable \nErrors in decision making \nTolerated \nNot tolerated \nRepetitive tasks \nYes \nNo \nOutcome feedback \nAvailable \nUnavailable \nProblem decomposition \nYes \nNo \nUse of decision aids \nRoutine \nNot routine \nSource: James Shanteau, \u201cWhy Task Domains (Still) Matter for Understanding Expertise,\u201d Journal of Applied Research in \nMemory and Cognition, Vol. 4, No. 3, September 2015, 169-175. \nAnother consideration is whether experts agree with their prior judgments when presented with similar, or even \nidentical, input over time.

We can start by assuming that long-\nterm stock market returns combine fundamental company performance (e.g., sales growth, profits, return on \ninvestment, payout ratio) and macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, risk premia, economic growth, \ninflation). But a complicating factor is that the stock market reflects expectations about these inputs. Changes in \nexpectations play a large role in stock price performance, especially in the short to intermediate term.  \nQuantitative investors seek patterns, ideally supported by economic logic, to construct portfolios that aim to \ngenerate attractive returns after considering risk. A quantitative model is a decision support system. Quantitative \ninvestors seek factors that are associated with excess returns relative to a basic asset pricing model. For \nexample, the stocks that are cheap on multiples of book value or cash flow (value factor) have historically \ngenerated higher returns than stocks that are expensive (growth factor).31 Humans add value by building and \nupdating the model.  \nFundamental investors rely less on decision support systems and more on pattern recognition.32 Many build \nportfolios by seeking to select attractive securities based on bottom-up analysis. Specific events, such as the \nacquisition described in the introduction, often trigger a sense of pattern recognition. Fundamental investors are \nmore vulnerable to seeing patterns that are unreliable or do not exist than quantitative investors because they \nare less reliant on decision support systems. Indeed, in more uncertain environments people are less likely to \nuse algorithms.33 \nWe now look at why pattern recognition fails. \nWhy Does Pattern Recognition Fail? \nHumans are natural pattern seekers, a quality that likely conferred evolutionary advantage. Patterns have been \nuseful for much of the history of humankind because the environments were relatively stable and cause and \neffect were evident. Our modern world has created systems where cause and effect are obscure. As a result, \nwell-intentioned human interventions in complex social or natural systems commonly produce unintended \nconsequences. Pattern recognition often fails in complex and evolving environments.  \nComplex adaptive systems are an example of such an environment. \u201cComplex\u201d reflects lots of agents that \ninteract. \u201cAdaptive\u201d means that agents learn and evolve to reflect changes in the environment. And \u201csystem\u201d \nmeans that the whole that emerges has behaviors that cannot be readily explained by the agents alone. Ant \ncolonies, cities, ecologies, economies, and stock markets are examples of complex adaptive systems.34    \nProperly identifying patterns within these systems is hard because cause and effect is not always clear. These \nsystems also commonly exhibit non-linearity, where a small perturbation leads to a large outcome.   \nAn open letter to Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, about the perils of quantitative easing \nis a good example of illusory links. Quantitative easing, a form of monetary policy, describes when a central \nbank purchases assets in the open market to lower interest rates and increase the supply of money. Written by \nprominent economists, strategists, and investors and shared in November 2010, the letter suggested quantitative \neasing risked \u201ccurrency debasement and inflation.\u201d35 Neither debasement nor inflation were issues in the years \nthat followed. The pattern of quantitative easing leading to a lower dollar and inflation did not manifest. \nOne of the ways that non-linearity shows up in markets is through the loss of diversity. The economist Blake \nLeBaron is a leader in the field of agent-based modeling. These are models that create agents in silico, provide \n"

The asset has a fair value based on \ndividends. LeBaron tunes the model to generate asset price movements consistent with empirical reality, \nincluding clustered volatility and fat tails. The virtue of this approach is that he can measure the diversity of the \ndecisions the agents make. \nWhat he finds is that the asset price rises even as the diversity of decision rules declines because the similar \ntrading strategies reinforce the price movement. But at some point the market becomes fragile. At that critical \njuncture, a small incremental loss of diversity leads to a sharp plunge in the asset price because the buyers are \nexhausted.  The relationship between diversity loss and asset price change is non-linear. Diversity breakdowns \nfit a pattern but measuring diversity is inherently difficult.36  \nPattern recognition can also fail because of how our minds love to think in analogies. Steps include selection, \nmapping, evaluation, and learning.37 To understand a target topic we commonly start by selecting an analog, \nusually from memory. We map the target based on the source analog, seeking to make inferences. We evaluate \nthese inferences to judge the similarities and differences between the target and the source. We then learn how \nthe success or failure of the analog applies to the target.  \nFinding the correct analogy is valuable but rare. Pitfalls in the process are the result of breadth and depth. \nBreadth reflects that we simply have insufficient memory to recall and identify a proper analogy. Depth means \nthe similarities we identify are often superficial and not based on causal factors. The analogy may not work but \nit creates what Phil Tetlock calls \u201cimaginable scenarios.\u201d In studies, participants gain more accurate information \nwhen researchers prompt them to consider more than one analog.38   \nBecause our minds are so good at making analogies, we run the risk of apophenia, defined as \u201cthe tendency to \nperceive a connection or meaningful pattern between unrelated or random things.\u201d39 In the extreme, this can \nlead to conspiracy theories, superstitions, and false interpretations of randomness. \nIn fact, there is a module in the left hemisphere of our brain that seeks to create a narrative that links cause and \neffect. Neuroscientists call this \u201cthe interpreter.\u201d40 We are wired to see connections where none exist. The \nstrategy of \u201cfrequency matching,\u201d where the frequency of choices among alternatives matches the frequency of \nthe reward, is one example. But before discussing how and why adult humans do this, we will learn a lesson \nfrom how pigeons decide. \nScientists placed White Carneaux pigeons, the breed that the behaviorist B. F. Skinner had used in his work on \nconditioning, into an \u201coperant-conditioning chamber\u201d that had two keys they could peck. The researchers set it \nup so that one of the keys had a higher chance of a food reward than the other. The pigeons figured out which \nkey was better and hit it nearly every time. As a result, they got close to the optimal payoff. Kids under the age \nof four and rats come to the same strategy.41  \nAdult humans, on the other hand, tend to frequency match. After discovering the probabilities, humans go back \nand forth between the keys in an attempt to guess the next outcome. They seek a pattern. They select the higher \npayoff key at a rate that matches the frequency of the payoffs, but still go back and forth between the keys trying \nto anticipate the rewards. This strategy has a lower payoff than simply selecting the higher payoff key every \ntime.42  \nHumans frequency match from the time they enter kindergarten on. Here is where the interpreter within the left \nhemisphere comes in. Neuroscientists studied split-brain patients to figure out where in the brain decisions \n"

These are patients with severe epilepsy that doctors treat by surgically cutting the bundle of nerves \nbetween the brain\u2019s two hemispheres to relieve the symptoms of epilepsy. \nThe surgery allows scientists to create experiments to assess which parts of the brain deal with various tasks. \nResearchers worked with these unusual participants to figure out where the inclination to seek patterns resides. \nThe right hemisphere tends to be literal, so it is good at tasks such as facial recognition but bad at making \ninferences. The left hemisphere is where the circuitry for language largely sits, and it is also great at fabricating \nnarratives to fit facts.  \nResearchers found that when presented with a version of the probability guessing experiment, the right \nhemisphere of split-brain patients maximized just as the pigeons, rats, and little kids did. But when shown the \nsame experiment, the left hemisphere of the patients tried to match the frequency.43 Your left hemisphere is \ninclined to see patterns where none exist. \nAnother reason that pattern recognition fails is that investors often extrapolate. Jason Zweig, a financial \njournalist, cites an experiment where researchers showed participants a random sequence of squares and \ncircles while monitoring their brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). After seeing two \nsquares or circles in a row, the brain of the participants anticipated another of the same symbol.44  \nThe neuroscientists who did this work conclude, \u201cThe human cognitive system identifies patterns in sequences \nof events, regardless of whether a pattern truly exists.\u201d45 In this case, the pattern is \u201cwhat just happened is going \nto continue happening.\u201d  \nBen Graham, the father of security analysis, shared a cautionary case study about a company called AAA \nEnterprises. The high-flying stock was first issued to the public in 1969 at $13 per share and immediately shot \nup to $28 despite flimsy fundamentals.46 But the stock was grounded shortly thereafter, reaching $0.50 per share \nin early 1971, as the firm filed for bankruptcy. Graham wrote, \u201cThe speculative public is incorrigible. In financial \nterms it cannot count beyond 3.\u201d47 \nIn truth, assuming the future will be similar to the past beats a lot of expert forecasts. But it also introduces the \nrisk of overextrapolation and a failure to recognize regression toward the mean. Financial economists suggest \nthat extrapolation plays an important role in asset pricing, including explaining the momentum factor and the \ninflation and deflation of bubbles.48 It also offers insight into why investors anticipate high returns after the \nmarket\u2019s returns have been high, and low returns after the market\u2019s returns have been low.49 \nOne key feature of pattern recognition is that it is intuitive. Research in cognitive psychology shows that in some \ncases when an individual realizes their intuition is misguided, they still act on it rather than correcting their error. \nThis is called \u201cacquiescing\u201d to intuition.50  \nFor example, in one experiment researchers created a scenario in an American football game where the \nparticipant had to choose between punting or going for it on fourth down late in a close game.51 The analysis \nshowed that going for it had a win probability nine percentage points higher than punting did. Forty percent of \nthe participants had the intuition to punt but understood that the analytics said to go for it. Of that group, 56 \npercent elected to acquiesce to their intuition and punt anyway.52 \nIn the case of acquiescence, individuals are aware that pattern recognition does not offer a reliable answer but \nnevertheless default to it. They fail to correct what they know to be an error. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6144451 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n8\n \n \nHow to Improve Pattern Recognition \nAcknowledging when pattern recognition is reliable is the first step in trusting its usefulness. Individuals can \ncultivate pattern recognition in systems that are stable, provide reliable cues, and lend themselves to accurate \nfeedback. Pattern recognition can be alluring but misleading in systems without those traits. The inputs to an \ninvestment process can span both systems, so pattern recognition is helpful to fundamental investors in some \ncontexts and unsuitable in others.  \nTwo prerequisites for acquiring intuitive expertise are a stable and linear environment and proper training with \ninputs that explain what works. Many, if not most, fundamental investors do not meet these basics. They tend \nto model corporate performance using what psychologists call the \u201cinside view,\u201d which focuses on the individual \ncircumstances of a problem and draws heavily on personal understanding. For investors, this is a bottom-up \nmethod that considers the firm\u2019s specific issues and is guided by the analyst\u2019s experience.  \nA different approach, called the \u201coutside view,\u201d is integral to training for pattern recognition. The outside view \nconsiders a problem as an instance of a larger reference class. By knowing the outcomes from the reference \nclass, or the base rates, an investor can make informed, albeit probabilistic, assessments about what will come \nnext. This is the goal of quantitative investors and offers insight into how fundamental investors can hone their \nability to recognize patterns. \nOne example is modeling sales growth, which is usually the most important driver of shareholder value.53 The \ndistribution of sales growth rates tends to be reasonably stable over time, which means it is feasible to place \ngrowth expectations in the context of what has happened before. Anticipated growth rates relative to the base \nrate provide a cue about expectations. Growth that is higher than expected for a company that creates value \nleads to attractive total shareholder returns. And expected growth versus actual growth offers feedback.  \nSales growth rates show substantial regression toward the mean, which says that results that are far from \naverage tend to be followed by outcomes closer to the average. In practical terms, both high and low past growth \nrates precede growth rates closer to the average for a population of companies. Sales growth rates and how \nthey regress follow patterns that investors can learn to recognize.   \nThe outcomes from M&A are another example of where pattern recognition may be useful, notwithstanding the \nstory in the opening. Historically, most M&A deals have failed to create value for the buyer, as measured by \ncumulative abnormal stock returns.54 But there are ways to shade the odds in favor of the buyer, including paying \na small premium to acquire the seller, paying for the deal in cash versus stock, and doing deals for businesses \nthat have operations similar to those of the buyer.55 \nObserving the distribution of outcomes within a reference class can provide some insight into how difficult it is \nto predict patterns. For example, since 1984 the distribution of 10-year sales growth rates for public companies \nin the U.S. with $5-10 billion of initial sales follows a distribution that resembles the classic bell curve, with a \nmean and median around 4.5 percent and a standard deviation of 8.5 percent.56   \nBut the distribution of book sales follows a power law, where most of the observations have small outcomes and \na few observations have large outcomes.57 For instance, of the 3 million titles offered by booksellers, only a \nhandful sell more than 1 million copies, about 4,000 new titles sell more than 1,000 in a year, and most sell fewer \nthan 100.58 Outcomes that follow a power law are generally an indication of a wicked environment, where cause \nand effect are unclear and pattern recognition is hard.    \n"

The guidance \non how to do so tends to be qualitative.59 But training intuition, a precursor to useful pattern recognition, almost \ncertainly requires having solid data on the relevant base rate. Cues, causality, and feedback are essential. \nThere is some risk to learning the wrong lessons from an inappropriate reference class, but in our view the \nbigger risk is a failure to use base rates in the first place. There are a handful of reasons investors do not use \nbase rates. To start, decision makers trust the inside view as it centers on their analysis and experience. This \nhelps explain acquiescence. \nIndividuals also see their situation as unique and do not perceive that examining related instances provides \ninsight. Interestingly, most people are better at recognizing when the outside view applies to others than when \nit applies to themselves. You can relate to this if you have ever quipped to an acquaintance that their home \nrenovation project will take longer and cost more than they have bargained for.60      \nEven in cases when decision makers are willing to use base rates, the data may not be at their fingertips. Few \nfundamental investors have studied past measures of corporate performance in sufficient detail to prepare their \nminds to anticipate what might happen in the situation they face. Experience does not offer a simple solution \nbecause our memories can capture and retain only a sliver of what has happened.   \nThe bottom line is that fundamental investors can train their ability to recognize patterns under the correct \nconditions. Data that provide cues and causality, as well having a basis for timely and accurate feedback, are \nfundamental. The efficacy of pattern recognition is context dependent. \nConclusion \nMany fundamental investors rely on pattern recognition as part of their decision-making process. They create \nplausible stories informed by their experience and memory. But it is important to consider how pattern recognition \nworks to understand its applicability.  \nPattern recognition is more effective in stable environments where cause and effect are clear and participants \nare trained using timely and accurate feedback. This applies in many domains, including sports, music, and \nchess. Participants in these areas can develop intuitive expertise, an unconscious sense of recognition that \nleads to superior performance.  \nPattern recognition tends to fail in domains where causality and feedback are limited. But that does not stop \ndecision makers from feeling the sense of pattern recognition. Our mental apparatus allows us to see patterns \nthat truly exist as well as to see them when they do not exist.61 \nDistinguishing between experience and expertise is crucial. All experts have experience but not all with \nexperience are experts. The defining feature of an expert is having a predictive model that works. Ample \nresearch shows that expert predictions in social, political, and economic realms are poor. Expert views tend to \ncorrelate in realms where expert prediction is effective. \nThis shortcoming is more a reflection of the domain than of the person and underscores the importance of \nunderstanding the boundaries of useful prediction. But our minds are keen to go out of bounds, imposing patterns \nwhere none exist or acquiescing to our gut reaction even when we know that using explicit analysis can help \ncorrect a decision error. \n"

To simplify \ngreatly, with pooling the balance sheets of the buyer and seller were added together and there was no effect on \nearnings. With a purchase, any payment above book value was recorded as goodwill, and amortized over a \nperiod up to 40 years. In this case there was a negative effect on earnings. In 2001, the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board (FASB) got rid of pooling as well as the amortization of goodwill. Today companies must only \ndo a periodic check to verify that the carrying value of goodwill is proper and take a write-down if the value is \nimpaired. See Abraham J. Briloff, \u201cCannibalizing the Transcendent Margin: Reflections on Conglomeration, \nLBOs, Recapitalizations and Other Manifestations of Corporate Mania,\u201d Financial Analysts Journal, Vol. 44, No. \n3, May-June 1988, 74-80. \n5 Alan Sloan, \"KKR and the Big Leveraged Buyout End of an Age,\" Washington Post, June 19, 1990.  \n6 Shortly after the deal, Conagra changed its internal earnings measure to reflect that goodwill is a non-cash and \nnon-economic charge. From the company\u2019s 1994 Form 10-K: \u201cDuring fiscal 1993, we improved our objectives \nby incorporating a concept called \u2018cash earnings\u2019\u2014net earnings plus goodwill amortization. Businesses run on \ncash. The principal source of internally generated cash is net earnings before depreciation of fixed assets and \namortization of goodwill. Cash from depreciation is generally needed for replenishment to help maintain a going \nconcern. On the other hand, goodwill represents valuable non-depreciating brands and distribution systems, \nprimarily those we acquired with Beatrice Company in fiscal year 1991. We invest and incur expense throughout \nthe year to maintain and enhance the value of these brands and distribution systems. Consequently, goodwill \namortization is not a true economic cash cost. It, along with net earnings, is a source of decision cash\u2014cash \navailable to invest in ConAgra's growth and pay dividends.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \n7 AV Ventures Communications Team, \u201cBest Practices in Patter Recognition,\u201d Alumni Ventures, November 9, \n2021.  \n8 See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pattern (the seventh definition) and www.merriam-webster.com/ \ndictionary/recognize. \n9 Michael Grant and Fredrik Nilsson, Intuitive Expertise and Financial Decision-Making (Abingdon, UK: \nRoutledge, 2023). \n10 Hebert A.
