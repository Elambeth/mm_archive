The goal for each is to generate an attractive return \non investment. Companies create value when their investments earn a \nreturn in excess of the opportunity cost of capital. Investors add value \nwhen their portfolios generate a return higher than an appropriate \nmarket benchmark. \nExecutives make investments in tangible and intangible assets over \ntime. Equity investors buy and sell stocks, which are essentially claims \non a company\u2019s cash flows after it pays all of its bills and makes all of \nits investments. A company\u2019s stock price reflects the expectations for \nfuture cash flows based on past, present, and prospective investments.  \nCompanies generally earn higher returns than investors do because \nthey are making different investments. Companies continually invest in \nassets in order to create value in the business, while investors buy a \nstock at a point in time in anticipation of revisions in expectations. In an \nefficient market, a company\u2019s valuation accurately reflects the \nexpectations for value creation. Valuation differences equilibrate the \nexpected returns for companies of similar risk. \nFor example, imagine that one company invests $1,000 that allows it \nto earn and distribute $100 annually into perpetuity. The cost of capital \nis 10 percent. That business is worth $1,000 ($100/0.10). Consider a \nsecond company with the same cost of capital that invests $1,000 but \nearns $200 in distributable cash. That business has a value of $2,000 \n($200/0.10). The company earns a 20 percent return on its investment, \nbut the shareholder still earns 10 percent. The market places a high \nvalue on invested capital for businesses that generate attractive \nreturns, which lowers the expected return for investors. \n \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n5626056 Exp. 04/30/2024 \n2 \n \nExecutives should learn to read the expectations that their company\u2019s stock price reflects for a number of \nreasons.1 To begin, most senior managers are shareholders, and excess returns are tied to revisions in \nexpectations. Executives must also be aware that making investments that create value may be insufficient to \nsustain the stock price if the market\u2019s expectations are for either a larger amount of investment or a higher return \non investment. In addition, an appreciation for what\u2019s priced in can guide management\u2019s communication with \nthe financial community. Finally, expectations can inform certain capital allocation decisions. For instance, \nexecutives who believe their company\u2019s stock price reflects expectations that are too pessimistic can \nadvantageously repurchase shares. They can also issue shares when expectations are too optimistic. \nInvestors earn excess returns when they correctly anticipate revisions in expectations for future cash flows. To \nfind mispriced expectations, investors must understand the potential magnitude and return on investment. \nThis report seeks to help executives and investors in three ways. First, we describe market-expected return on \ninvestment (MEROI), which measures the return at which the present value of a company\u2019s profits equals the \npresent value of the investments a company makes.2 An understanding of MEROI allows us to understand how \nhigh the bar is set for corporate performance. \nSecond, we note that measuring returns has become more difficult as corporate investments have shifted from \nbeing primarily tangible to intangible. Because intangible investments are recorded as expenses, the \ncategorization of expenses and investments is blurred.3 We seek to gain a more accurate view of returns, and \nhence expectations, by separating expenses and investments properly. \nFinally, we discuss the shortcomings of common measures of corporate returns, including return on equity \n(ROE), return on invested capital (ROIC), return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC), and internal rate of \nreturn (IRR). While these measures have some utility, they are commonly used without full acknowledgment of \ntheir limitations.  \nThe connection between valuation (MEROI) and accounting (properly measuring intangible investment) is what \nmakes this report novel. Some of the following discussion is technical, but the underlying concepts are \nstraightforward and are illustrated with examples and a case study. \nMarket-Expected Return on Investment \nFrequent readers know that we start a lot of discussions about valuation with the 60-year-old paper by the \neconomists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (M&M) called, \u201cDividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of \nShares.\u201d4 In the paper, which launched modern valuation, M&M discuss an \u201capproach to valuation which would \nseem most natural from the standpoint of an investor.\u201d  \nThey suggest that you can think about corporate value in two parts: the current earning power of the business \nplus \u201cthe opportunities, if any, that the firm offers for making additional investments in real assets that will yield \nmore than the \u2018normal\u2019 (market) rate of return.\u201d The earning power, or steady-state value, is commonly \nrepresented as the current net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) capitalized by the cost of capital. The \nopportunities for investments that create value, often called the \u201cpresent value of growth opportunities\u201d \n(PVGO), reflect the spread between the return on investment and the cost of capital, how much a company \ncan invest, and how long a company can find value-creating opportunities.5   \nCorporate value = steady-state value + present value of growth opportunities (PVGO)  \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5626056 Exp. 04/30/2024 \n3 \n \nNote that if the return on incremental investment equals the cost of capital, the PVGO collapses to zero and \nthe value of the firm is simply the steady-state value. Our task is to measure the PVGO accurately. You can do \nthat only if you understand the difference between expenses and investments, which our current accounting \nrules obscure.  \nThe best way to walk through this analysis is with a case. Exhibit 1 shows a simple discounted cash flow \n(DCF) model. This model calculates corporate value by taking the sum of the present value of future free cash \nflows (NOPAT - Investment) and adding the present value of the continuing value. Later we will suggest that \nyou create a DCF model that solves for the market\u2019s expectations based on today\u2019s stock price. But for now \nwe focus on the mechanics of the model. \nNOPAT is $100 in year 1 and it grows 8 percent per year. Investment is determined by assuming the change \nin NOPAT from one year to the next divided by the initial year\u2019s investment equals 25 percent. For example, \nthe change in NOPAT from year 1 to 2 is $8, and the investment in year 1 is $32, so the ratio is $8/$32, or 25 \npercent. The continuing value is NOPAT from year 11 capitalized by the cost of capital ($215.9/0.07 = \n$3,084.2).6  \nCorporate value is $2,230.8 given these assumptions. We can now go back to M&M and break down the value \ninto a steady-state and a PVGO. The steady-state is $1,428.6, or NOPAT in year 1 of $100 capitalized by the \ncost of capital of 7 percent ($100/0.07 = $1,428.6). By definition, the PVGO is $802.2, or $2,230.8 - $1,428.6. \nExhibit 1: Simple Discounted Cash Flow Model \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Assumes 8% NOPAT growth, 25% ROIIC, and 7% cost of capital; \u03a3=sum of. \nAlfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at Kellogg School of Management, shows how to calculate the PVGO \nthrough a measure he calls shareholder value added (SVA).7 The PVGO is the sum of the SVAs in the model.  \nThe value a company creates in a particular year comes from the cash flows it generates and the change in its \ncontinuing value. Take a look at year 1 in exhibit 2. SVA is $76.9, the sum of the present value of free cash \nflow of $63.6 plus the change in the present value of the continuing value of $13.4 ($76.9 = $63.6 + $13.4). If \nyou add up the SVAs from each year you get a total PVGO of $802.2.  \n \n \nYear\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nNOPAT \n100.0\n108.0\n116.6\n126.0\n136.0\n146.9\n158.7\n171.4\n185.1\n199.9\n215.9\nInvestment\n32.0\n34.6\n37.3\n40.3\n43.5\n47.0\n50.8\n54.8\n59.2\n64.0\nFree cash flow\n68.0\n73.4\n79.3\n85.7\n92.5\n99.9\n107.9\n116.5\n125.9\n135.9\nPV of free cash flow\n63.6\n64.1\n64.7\n65.3\n66.0\n66.6\n67.2\n67.8\n68.5\n69.1\nS PV of free cash flow \n662.9\nContinuing value\n3,084.2\nS PV of free cash flow\n662.9\nPV of continuing value\n1,567.8\nCorporate value\n2,230.8\n"

Recall that the PVGO is \ndetermined by how much, at what return, and for how long a company can find value creating opportunities. \nAnd the PVGO is just the sum of the SVAs. We can calculate total SVA as the present value of the \nincremental NOPATs minus the present value of the investments. The SVA and PVGO are positive if a \ncompany earns returns on its investments that exceed the cost of capital. This is exactly what M&M had in \nmind when they described the PVGO as \u201cthe opportunities . . . for making additional investments. . . that will \nyield more than the . . . (market) rate of return.\u201d \nIf a company earns exactly its cost of capital on its investments, the present value of incremental NOPAT and \nthe present value of investment will be equal. SVA and PVGO are both zero. \nExhibit 3 shows this calculation for our case. The present value of the incremental NOPATs sum to $1,114.1, \nand the total present value of the investments equal $312.0. The difference between the two is $802.2 \n($1,114.1 - $312.0 = $802.2).    \nExhibit 3: Alternative Calculation of Shareholder Value Added (SVA) \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Assumes 8% NOPAT growth, 25% ROIIC, and 7% cost of capital; \u0394=change in; \u03a3=sum of. \nWe are now ready to solve for MEROI, which is the discount rate at which the present value of the incremental \nNOPAT inflows equals the present value of the investment outflows discounted at the cost of capital. Exhibit 4 \nshows that we need a 16.2 percent rate in order for the present value of incremental NOPATs to equal the \npresent value of investments. Since 16.2 percent is well above the cost of capital of 7 percent, we know that \nthe PVGO is positive.   \n \nYear\nBase\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nFree cash flow\n68.0\n73.4\n79.3\n85.7\n92.5\n99.9\n107.9\n116.5\n125.9\n135.9\nPV of free cash flow\n63.6\n64.1\n64.7\n65.3\n66.0\n66.6\n67.2\n67.8\n68.5\n69.1\nContinuing value\n1,542.9 1,666.3 1,799.6 1,943.6 2,099.0 2,267.0 2,448.3 2,644.2 2,855.7 3,084.2\nPV of continuing value\n1,428.6 1,441.9 1,455.4 1,469.0 1,482.7 1,496.6 1,510.6 1,524.7 1,538.9 1,553.3 1,567.8\nChange in PV of continuing value\n13.4\n13.5\n13.6\n13.7\n13.9\n14.0\n14.1\n14.2\n14.4\n14.5\nTotal\nSVA\nShareholder value added\n76.9\n77.6\n78.3\n79.1\n79.8\n80.6\n81.3\n82.1\n82.8\n83.6\n802.2\nYear\nBase\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nNOPAT\n100.0\n108.0\n116.6\n126.0\n136.0\n146.9\n158.7\n171.4\n185.1\n199.9\n215.9\nD NOPAT\n8.0\n8.6\n9.3\n10.1\n10.9\n11.8\n12.7\n13.7\n14.8\n16.0\nSum\nD NOPAT capitalized\n114.3\n123.4\n133.3\n144.0\n155.5\n167.9\n181.4\n195.9\n211.5\n228.5\nInflows\nPV D NOPAT capitalized\n106.8\n107.8\n108.8\n109.8\n110.9\n111.9\n112.9\n114.0\n115.1\n116.1\n1,114.1\nS PV of D NOPAT capitalized\nSum\nInvestment\n32.0\n34.6\n37.3\n40.3\n43.5\n47.0\n50.8\n54.8\n59.2\n64.0\nOutflows\nPV of investment\n29.9\n30.2\n30.5\n30.8\n31.0\n31.3\n31.6\n31.9\n32.2\n32.5\n312.0\nInflows\n- Outflows\n=Total SVA\nShareholder value added\n76.9\n77.6\n78.3\n79.1\n79.8\n80.6\n81.3\n82.1\n82.8\n83.6\n802.2\n"

First, you create a discounted cash flow model that \nreflects the expectations embedded in the company\u2019s stock price.8 Second, you calculate the present value of \ninvestments discounted at the cost of capital. And finally, you solve for the breakeven rate that equates the \npresent value of the capitalized annual NOPAT changes to the present value of the investments. \nOur next challenge is to measure investment properly.   \nThe Importance of the Rise of Intangible Investments  \nThere has been a substantial transformation in the way companies invest over the past half century. An \ninvestment is an outlay today that creates an asset that is expected to have positive economic value based on \nfuture cash flows. Tangible assets, such as factories, machines, and inventory, were the dominant form of \ninvestment in the 1970s. Intangible assets, including research and development (R&D), brand building, and \nemployee training, are the dominant form today.9  \nThis is important because investments in tangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet and intangible \ninvestments commonly show up on the income statement. Sorting expenses and investments was easy when \nmost of the expenses were on the income statement and most of the assets were on the balance sheet. But \ncategorization is a challenge today because income statements conflate expenses and investments. \nOne consequence of the shift to intangible investments is that more companies are reporting negative net \nincome than what we have seen in the past (see exhibit 5). To be clear, companies can report losses because \ntheir expensed investments exceed current earnings, which is good if the investments promise attractive \neconomic returns. Companies can also report losses when their expenses exceed their sales, which is bad if \nthe business is fundamentally unprofitable. Separating expenses from investments has never been so \nimportant.  \n \n \n \nYear\nBase\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nPresent value of investments (outflows) discounted at the cost of capital\nInvestment\n32.0\n34.6\n37.3\n40.3\n43.5\n47.0\n50.8\n54.8\n59.2\n64.0\nPV of investment\n29.9\n30.2\n30.5\n30.8\n31.0\n31.3\n31.6\n31.9\n32.2\n32.5\nS PV of Investment\n312.0\nPresent value of NOPAT (inflows) discounted at the MEROI\nNOPAT\n100.0\n108.0\n116.6\n126.0\n136.0\n146.9\n158.7\n171.4\n185.1\n199.9\n215.9\nD NOPAT\n8.0\n8.6\n9.3\n10.1\n10.9\n11.8\n12.7\n13.7\n14.8\n16.0\nD NOPAT capitalized\n49.3\n53.3\n57.5\n62.1\n67.1\n72.5\n78.3\n84.5\n91.3\n98.6\nPV D NOPAT capitalized\n42.4\n39.4\n36.7\n34.1\n31.7\n29.4\n27.3\n25.4\n23.6\n21.9\nS PV of D NOPAT capitalized\n312.0\nMarket expected return on investment\n16.2%\n"

The first is intangible investments \nthat include R&D and advertising. The second is selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses \nexcluding R&D and advertising, which they call Main SG&A. They further break Main SG&A into investment \nand maintenance parts. You can think of investment Main SG&A as the discretionary investments a company \nmakes in pursuit of growth that creates value. Maintenance Main SG&A are the expenses that support current \noperations. \nIn exhibit 6, we use Enache and Srivastava\u2019s breakdown to estimate the amount companies in the Russell \n3000 spent on intangible investment and maintenance SG&A (we exclude companies in the financial services \nindustry). \nFor example, Enache and Srivastava estimate that nearly 40 percent of Main SG&A went to investments in the \nmid-1980s and that in recent years the ratio rose to roughly 60 percent. Conversely, about 60 percent of Main \nSG&A went to maintenance in the mid-1980s and in recent years the ratio has fallen to roughly 40 percent. To \ncalculate the annual dollar amount of investment Main SG&A and maintenance SG&A, we apply the applicable \nrate for each year times the aggregate dollar amount of SG&A for each year. Intangible investments are the \nsum of investment Main SG&A, R&D, and advertising. \nIntangible investment has been in a steady uptrend, with a brief interruption during the financial crisis, and \npassed maintenance spending in 2000. To put this figure in context, investments in intangible assets were \nroughly $1.8 trillion in 2020, more than double the $800 billion in capital expenditures. These data put the lie to \nthe assertion that companies are investing less than they used to. \nThis work shows clearly that investments in intangible assets are rising relative to those in tangible assets.

We start the analysis at the beginning of fiscal year 2004 (the company\u2019s \nfiscal year ends on June 30) and use actual results through fiscal year 2020. While MEROI measures the \nbreakeven return based on the future cash flows that are priced into a stock, you might imagine that we had a \ncrystal ball for our Microsoft figures.    \nExhibit 8 is a discounted cash flow model based on the numbers as reported. We assume a cost of equity of \n9.5 percent, an estimate of what it was at that time, and a continuing value based on the perpetuity method.12 \nIf you add excess cash to the corporate value and divide by shares outstanding, the value per share is within \n10 percent of the stock price at the time. Corporate value is $248.7 billion.  \nExhibit 8: Discounted Cash Flow Model for Microsoft, Fiscal Years 2004-2020 \n \nSource: Microsoft and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: In billions of U.S. dollars; \u03a3=sum of. \nWe can now calculate the MEROI. Corporate value of $248.7 billion equals the steady-state value of $61.0 \nbillion ($5.8/0.095) plus the PVGO of $187.7 billion.

There are \ntwo big decisions. The first is which expenses are properly considered investments, and the second is the \namortization period for the intangible asset. We defer to the work of Charles Hulten, a prominent academic in \nthe study of intangible assets, to answer these questions.13 This allows us to calculate the intangible \ninvestment and amortization expense for each year.  \nFor example, consider Microsoft\u2019s results for fiscal 2020 (year 17 in exhibit 8). NOPAT without adjustments \nwas $48 billion and investment was $10 billion for free cash flow of $38 billion. Hulten\u2019s method designates \n$34 billion of the $44 billion in operating expenses as investment. Based on his assumptions, the amortization \nfor fiscal 2020 comes out to $27 billion. This means that we add $7 billion ($34 - $27 billion) to NOPAT and \ninvestment. As a result, NOPAT goes from $48 to $55 billion, investment goes from $10 to $17 billion, and free \ncash flow of $38 billion remains unchanged. \nExhibit 10 shows the adjusted numbers for the full period. Neither the free cash flow nor corporate value \nchange. What is different is the path to free cash flow.

Naturally, companies should invest in intangible investments if they create value. The data show \nthis to be the case.15  \nThe difference between the unadjusted and the adjusted MEROI is a function of what percentage of SG&A is \nreclassified and the assigned amortization period. (See the appendix for a more detailed discussion.) If no \nSG&A is considered to be an investment, no adjustments are necessary. The higher the percentage of SG&A \nthat is capitalized, the lower the adjusted MEROI is relative to the unadjusted MEROI. For intangible intensive \nbusinesses, this difference is substantial enough to reframe an understanding of the underlying economics of \nthe business.  \nTaking Measure of Measures of Return (ROE, ROIC, ROIIC, IRR) \nMEROI is an accurate, if involved, calculation of expected returns for a business. The question is how it stacks \nup to other more mainstream measures of returns. These include return on equity (ROE), return on invested \ncapital (ROIC), return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC), and internal rate of return (IRR).  \nROE, defined as net income divided by shareholders\u2019 equity, is massively distorted by the rise of intangibles. \nNet income has always been unreliable because of the considerable discretion management has in reporting \nexpenses within accepted accounting principles. Shareholders\u2019 equity has also lost relevance because of the \nvagaries of accounting, including share repurchases. For instance, Home Depot\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity was \nnegative $3.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2020 as the result of the company\u2019s share buyback program. \nROE has an additional flaw in that it is not financing neutral. Changes in a company\u2019s capital structure can \ninfluence the level of ROE. After considering all of these limitations, ROE is at best a very crude indicator of \nreturns on investment. Further, adjusting for intangibles does not provide a simple and consistent improvement \nin the measure.16  \nROIC, which is NOPAT divided by invested capital, is a step in the correct direction and is one of the best of \nthe accounting measures because it has a sound numerator.17 The concept has been around for a long time. \nFor example, General Motors used a version of ROIC more than a century ago.18 \nNOPAT and invested capital are unaffected by financial leverage. However, both NOPAT and invested capital \nchange substantially as intangible investments are converted to assets on the balance sheet.   \nLet\u2019s go back to our example of Microsoft. We have already seen that the adjustments lift NOPAT from $48 to \n$55 billion. The invested capital goes from $96 to $174 billion.19 As a result, the return on average invested \ncapital goes from 52 percent ($48 billion / average of $89 billion and $96 billion) when unadjusted to 33 \npercent ($55 billion / average of $160 billion and $174 billion) when adjusted. Exhibit 12 shows the difference \nbetween these figures over time. Just as MEROI is lower after making adjustments, so is ROIC. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Economic profit is defined as \nfollows:  \nEconomic profit = (ROIC - cost of capital) x invested capital \nThe concept of residual income is also old.20 In the 1990s, Stern Stewart & Company, the consulting firm, \npopularized the idea through Economic Value Added (EVA\u2122).21 The main contribution of EVA is the \nintroduction of a slew of adjustments to invested capital in an attempt to more accurately reflect the capital \ninvested in the business.  \nAll things being equal, a higher ROIC is better than a lower one. But as we have seen, a failure to account for \nintangible investment can lead to distorted, or even nonsensical, ROICs.  \nThere are a couple of points to consider with ROIC and valuation. First, models based on free cash flow and \neconomic profit yield identical values. The top panel of exhibit 13 is identical to exhibit 1, and the bottom panel \nis an economic profit model. They come to the same value because they have the same cash flows. \nHowever, the allocation of value is different. The first model is consistent with the M&M formula by specifying \nthe steady-state value and the PVGO, a measure of future value creation. The economic profit model does not \nseparate the components of value as neatly.  \nFor example, beginning capital can be any number without affecting corporate value. We use $1,000 in exhibit \n13, but we could have plugged in any number and not changed corporate value. For a given set of future cash \nflows, one company might show substantial value creation because of a modest beginning capital figure and \nanother might reflect large value destruction as the result of a large beginning capital total. The allocation of \ncorporate value is the same for a free cash flow and economic profit model only if the beginning capital \nhappens to be identical to the steady-state value. This is very rarely the case.    \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\nPercent\nROIC\nAdjusted ROIC\n"

One-year \nROIICs can be noisy, especially for companies that have an uneven pattern of investment spending. It often \nmakes sense to use rolling three- or five-year ROIICs because they are more stable.   \nThe allure of ROIIC is that it is incremental and therefore avoids the issue of sunk costs. The problem with \nROIIC is that it overstates economic returns for businesses earning above the cost of capital and understates \nreturns for those earning below the cost of capital. This problem becomes more acute as the competitive \nadvantage period (CAP), the period it is assumed a company can generate excess returns on new \ninvestments, lengthens. CAP is an important part of the calculation of the PVGO.  \nAs we saw when we defined SVA, the value a company creates in a specific year comes from the cash flows it \ngenerates and the change in its continuing value.

All rights reserved. \n5626056 Exp. 04/30/2024 \n15 \n \nPanel C makes the more sensible assumption that the interim cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital \nof 7 percent. So rather than ending up with $185.5, the new sum is $143.8. This drops the IRR to 14 percent.  \nAssessing the corporate rate of return is a great deal more challenging than measuring a single outflow and a \nsingle inflow. Companies generally make investments continually. MEROI is closer in principle to modified \nIRR, where investment outflows are discounted at the cost of capital and inflows are discounted at the rate that \nequates their present value to the present value of the outflows.25  \nAcademics have developed return metrics that are more accurate than those based on traditional accounting \nresults.26 What sets MEROI apart from all of the other measures is that it is an estimate based on the \nexpectations for all of the investments and cash flows reflected in a company\u2019s stock price.   \nConclusion \nInvestors generate excess returns when they buy the shares of companies prior to a revision in expectations \nabout future cash flows. A key determinant of cash flows is a company\u2019s ability to allocate capital to \ninvestments that create value. The current principles of accounting do a poor job of separating investments \nand expenses, creating a veil that obscures the magnitude and return on investment.27 A key job as an \nexecutive or investor is to adjust financial statements so as to lift the veil and understand the economics of the \nbusiness. \nThis report fills the gap between accounting and valuation by defining MEROI, providing guidance about how \nto separate SG&A costs into investment and expenses, and reviewing the limitations of popular measures of \nreturn. None of this changes a company\u2019s cash flow, of course, but clarity into investment and return on \ninvestment provides a sound basis for assessing expectations. \nThe global economy has undergone a substantial change in the past few decades, with intangible investments \nnow dominating tangible ones. But our financial statements and traditional valuation techniques struggle to \ncapture these changes. Thoughtful investors go the extra step to understand what expectations are priced into \na stock and whether the company is likely to meet those expectations.  \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5626056 Exp. 04/30/2024 \n16 \n \nAppendix: Interaction Between SG&A Capitalization and MEROI \nAccording to one definition, \u2018[a]ccounting seeks to measure the results of an organization\u2019s economic activities \nand convey this information to management, investors, creditors, regulatory agencies, consumers, and \nemployees.\u201d28 The world has changed, with intangible investments becoming more important than tangible \nones, and the principles of accounting have not kept up. The result is a large and growing gap between \neconomic reality and accounting results.29  \nHere we show the impact on MEROI as the assumed percentage of SG&A allocated to intangible investment \nrises. To set the stage, we need to make two points.  \nFirst, Miller and Modigliani established that corporate value equals steady-state value plus the present value of \ngrowth opportunities. The steady-state is defined as base year NOPAT divided by the cost of capital. When we \ncapitalize intangible investments as an asset, we reclassify an expense as an investment. That means that the \nNOPAT and investment increase by the exact same amount, leaving free cash flow unchanged.  \nThe more expenses that are capitalized, the more that the base year NOPAT rises. Because corporate value \ndoesn\u2019t change, the steady-state value goes up and the PVGO goes down. In other words, if a company that \nrelies on intangible investments decides it doesn\u2019t want to pursue value-creating growth, its NOPAT will rise. \nSecond, we calibrated our simple example to have an income statement similar to that of the S&P 500 \n(excluding financial companies). We assume 6 percent growth in sales and NOPAT, a 20 percent tax rate, 40 \npercent ROIIC, a 7 percent cost of capital, a 5-year amortization period, and a 10-year forecast horizon (see \nexhibit 16). SG&A for the S&P 500 is about 20 percent of sales.  \nExhibit 16: Assumptions in SG&A Capitalization Model \nBaseline Assumptions \nSales and NOPAT growth \n6.0% \nCOGS as a percent of sales \n67.5% \nSG&A as a percent of sales \n20.0% \nTax rate \n20.0% \nReturn on incremental invested capital \n40.0% \nCost of capital \n7.0% \nSG&A annual amortization rate \n20% (5 years) \nCompetitive advantage period \n10 years \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nNote: NOPAT=net operating profit after taxes; COGS=cost of goods sold; SG&A=selling, general, and administrative costs. \nMost academic papers suggest an SG&A capitalization rate of about 30 percent.30 Given these parameters, a \n30 percent capitalization rate results in a 10 percent MEROI (see exhibit 17). As the percentage falls, MEROI \nrises. And as the percentage rises, MEROI falls. This is precisely what we saw with our Microsoft example. In \nthis particular setup, MEROI equals the cost of capital at approximately 42 percent of capitalized SG&A.  \n \n \n \n"
