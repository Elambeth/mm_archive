      "text": " Cash Flow.com\n \n \u2013 3 \u2013\n Executive Summary\n\u2022 \nCash is king. Ever since the first Internet IPO, traditional valuation met-\nrics\u2014such as P/Es and earning growth rates\u2014have offered little or no guidance\nto investors trying to value Internet stocks. We disagree with the consensus view\nthat hype and hysteria drive the highflying valuations of Internet stocks. Like all\nbusinesses, Internet companies are valued on their ability to generate cash. If\nInternet companies have higher valuations than their offline counterparts, the\nmarket must believe that they have higher cash flows.\n\u2022 \nWhat you see is NOT what you get. Our analysis indicates that this is the\ncase. Free cash flow is calculated by netting a company\u2019s cash earnings and in-\nvestments. Most Old Economy companies have a cash inflow from earnings and\na cash outflow from investments. Thus, cash earnings for most Old Economy\ncompanies will typically overstate their free cash flow. To illustrate, Barnes and\nNoble generated $150 million in cash earnings for the twelve months ending on\nOctober 31, 1998. However, it also had to invest over $240 million during this\nperiod, translating into free cash flow of negative $95 million.\n\u2022 \nWhat you see is NOT what you get, part 2. The Internet companies we\nanalyzed all have superior cash economics than their Old Economy counterparts,\nalthough they generate cash in a totally different way. For example, while Ama-\nzon.com incurred a cash outflow from earnings of $58 million in 1998, it gener-\nated a cash inflow of $54 million from investments\u2014coming very close to\ngenerating positive free cash flow. This means that cash earnings for a New\nEconomy company can dramatically understate the company\u2019s total free cash\nflow.\n\u2022 \nHeed the balance sheet. In the past, investors anxious to own cash cows\nhave naturally focused on the income statement. However, our analysis indicates\nthat looking at the balance sheet of a New Economy company can unveil an im-\nportant source of cash. Investors must look at both financial statements, as it is\nfree cash flow\u2014the sum of a firm\u2019s cash earnings and investments\u2014that drives\nshareholder value creation. We believe that understanding these fundamental\ndifferences in the cash economics of business models will become increasingly\nimportant as the digital revolution transforms the world.\n"

Their valuations have skyrocketed\nwith no seeming connection to fundamentals. Everything seems backwards: the\nfaster many Internet companies grow sales, the greater their reported losses.\nAnd the more money they lose, the greater appetite investors appear to have for\nthese stocks.\n This spectacular run-up in Internet stocks has inspired some pointed questions.\nIs it reasonable that Amazon\u2019s equity market value is more than six times the\ncombined value of Barnes and Noble and Borders? Should a \u201cNew Media\u201d com-\npany like Yahoo! really trade at over 280 times 2000 estimated earnings, while a\ntraditional print media company like the New York Times trades at 17 times?\n These questions have prompted some investors to claim that we are in a new\nage where old rules do not apply. We disagree. Yes, for companies with no\nearnings, old valuation rules-of-thumb like price-to-earnings ratios have lost their\nrelevance. But the fundamental drivers of value remain the same. When inves-\ntors spend their hard-earned cash to buy a piece of a company\u2019s equity, they are\nbuying a share of the company\u2019s future cash flows. And whether investors are\npurchasing nascent Internet companies or mature food companies, the goal is\nthe same\u2014to buy into a stream of cash flows with a current value greater than\nthe price they paid.\n To understand how the market values any company, then, we first need to un-\nderstand the cash economics of business models\u2014a company\u2019s propensity to\ngenerate or consume cash. Importantly, as an exemplar of the New Econ-\nomy, Internet companies tend to have drastically different cash economics\nthan their Old Economy counterparts. What is obvious is that many Internet\ncompanies are currently incurring losses as they spend millions in marketing,\nwhile their off-line competitors reap cash earnings. What is less obvious is that\nNew Economy companies invest much less in their computers and office space\nthan Old Economy companies spend on bricks-and-mortar and working capital.\nWe believe that understanding these fundamental differences in the cash eco-\nnomics of business models will become increasingly important as the digital\nrevolution transforms the world.\n This report is broken into four parts. First, we outline a practical framework for\nanalyzing the cash economics of business models. Second, we introduce a\ngraphical way of highlighting differences between business models\u2014the cash\neconomics matrix\u2014and apply this framework to compare Old and New Economy\ncompanies. Third, we generalize from our case studies to outline a cash eco-\nnomics lifecycle for typical Old and New Economy companies. Finally, since the\nmarket values a company\u2019s ability to generate cash, we use this cash economics\nanalysis to explain one possible source of the relatively high valuations of New\nEconomy companies.\n                                                  \n 1 Outstanding Investor Digest.

One of the things that\nkeeps our life interesting is trying to avoid those and trying to get into the other\nkind of business that just drowns you in cash...\n \u2014Charlie Munger2\n Vice Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway\n Cash Economics of Business Models\n Earnings growth rates and P/Es may dominate Wall Street banter, but as any\nsmall business owner knows, a company\u2019s value stems from its ability to gener-\nate cash. Common sense dictates\u2014and the empirical evidence corroborates\u2014\nthat the same currency that pays the bills also drives shareholder value.3\n An investor\u2019s first step in valuing a company, then, is to assess how much cash a\nfirm generates or consumes in future years. There are two components to this:\n\u2022 \nCash earnings. A company can generate or consume cash from its after tax\noperating profit. We can calculate this figure by subtracting a firm\u2019s cash taxes\nfrom its operating income.4 Note that a company\u2019s cash earnings may be radi-\ncally different from accounting metrics such as net income, owing to distortions\nfrom non-cash accounting entries such as goodwill amortization and financing\ncosts such as interest expense.\n\u2022 \nCash investments. A company can consume or generate cash by investing\ndifferent amounts in its on- and off-balance sheet assets. This investment in-\ncludes both changes in net working capital\u2014such as accounts receivable, which\nserve as cash loans extended to finance customer purchases\u2014and in fixed as-\nsets\u2014such as investments in property, plant and equipment, and any invest-\nments in mergers or acquisitions.5\nThis analysis tells us exactly how much cash a company generates or consumes\nfrom these two components. In addition, the sum of these two amounts gives us\nfree cash flow for that period\u2014the cash pool available to pay the firm\u2019s capital\nproviders. This is critical because the market values a company by discounting\nits best guess of future cash flows to the present value at the firm\u2019s opportunity\n                                                  \n 2 Outstanding Investor Digest. September 24, 1998. Page 37.\n3 \u201cWolf Bytes 20\u2014Earnings are an Opinion, Cash is a Fact,\u201d Charles R. Wolf and Bob Hiler, Credit Suisse First Boston\nEquity Research, December 20, 1997.\n4 In accounting terms, we start with a firm\u2019s Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). We then subtract\ncash taxes\u2014the amount the company would have paid if it were entirely equity financed, with no inter-\nest payments on its debt to shield the company from taxes. Accordingly, to calculate cash taxes, we\nfirst add the tax shield from interest expense to the income tax provision reported on the income state-\nment. We also have to add back the tax benefit of the implied interest expense of off-balance sheet\ndebt-equivalents, such as capitalized operating leases. These tax shields will be equal to the interest\nexpense multiplied by the marginal tax rate.  Next, we do an equivalent calculation to add back the tax\nimpact of non-operating income or expenses to isolate the tax burden of the firm\u2019s operating income.\nFinally, we subtract any increase in the deferred tax balance, since we wish to arrive at cash taxes paid;\nthis difference represents taxes that have been accrued, but will not be paid until a later period.\n5 As a technical detail, note that we calculate cash earnings net of depreciation to measure a company\u2019s\neconomic earnings. To make sure that free cash flow is not understated, we also calculate cash in-\nvestments to be net of depreciation. That is, cash investment measures the cash that a company must\ninvest over and above its annual depreciation. Also, to avoid seasonal fluctuations and quarterly\nswings, we calculate both figures by summing the appropriate numbers for the last twelve months.\n"

As Figure 2 illustrates,\ncompanies tend to fall into one of four categories:\n1. Profitable Buildout. Traditionally, successful companies have a cash inflow\nfrom earnings, and a cash outflow from its investments in working capital and\nbricks-and-mortar stores or factories. Companies that fit this profile are in the\nupper-left Profitable Buildout quadrant of our diagram.\n2. Startups and Value Destroyers. There are two kinds of companies in the\nlower-left quadrant, with earnings and investment as outflows. The first type is a\nStartup that is both investing in the business and incurring losses as it grows.\nThe second type\u2014a Value Destroyer\u2014makes significant investments in nega-\ntive-return businesses. Since both of these scenarios necessarily imply a high\ncash burn-rate, companies in this quadrant face bankruptcy unless they start\ngenerating positive cash flow\u2014or have deep-pocketed owners.\n3. Turnarounds and Emerging Capital Efficient Companies. Business models\nthat are in the lower-right quadrant\u2014companies with investment as an inflow and\nearnings as an outflow\u2014tend to be quite uncommon. In one scenario, a strug-\ngling Turnaround company liberates cash tied up in its balance sheet, while in-\ncurring income statement losses. This usually is a temporary phenomenon. A\nsecond scenario involves an Emerging Capital Efficient Company with negative\nearnings, but with a capital efficient business model that generates cash from\nworking capital as sales increase. Since most companies that can manage their\nworking capital this efficiently are also profitable, this scenario occurs infre-\nquently.\n4. Super Cash Flow. Companies in the upper-right Super Cash Flow quadrant\nhave both earnings and investment as a cash inflow. This kind of company is not\nonly profitable, but embarks on a one-time or continuous reduction in its net\n"

This diagram\u2014which we have dubbed the Cash Economics Matrix\u2014also\nshows a company\u2019s ability to generate free cash flow, as all points on a 45-\ndegree diagonal will have the same free cash flow.

      "text": " Cash Flow.com\n \n \u2013 8 \u2013\nTo illustrate this approach, we calculated generated cash economics matrices for\nBarnes and Noble and Amazon.com\u2014a pair of Old and New Economy compa-\nnies largely competing in the book retailing industry (see Figure 3 on next page).\nWhat is most striking about this diagram is the contrast between the cash eco-\nnomics of the two companies:\nBarnes and Noble shows it has consistently been in the Profitable Buildout quad-\nrant\u2014the company has generated a cash earnings inflow and a cash investment\noutflow for every quarter since its January 1995 fiscal year. Most striking is the\nmagnitude of the company\u2019s cash investments. For example, for the twelve-\nmonth period ending on October 31, 1998, the company had to invest $118 mil-\nlion to stock the shelves with books and extend credit to customers. Offsetting\nthis investment was $48 million in cash generated from increased accounts pay-\nable. Combined with $172 million invested in new megastores, this $70 million\nnet investment in working capital resulted in a total cash investment of over $240\nmillion.\nThus, even though Barnes and Noble generated almost $150 million in cash\nearnings over the same period, its large investments more than consumed this\namount, translating into free cash flow of negative $95 million. Notably, Barnes\nand Noble\u2019s operations have not generated positive free cash flow since it has\nbeen public.\nAmazon\u2019s cash economics matrix tells a completely different story. Indeed, as\nskeptics have emphasized, the company\u2019s low prices, high marketing expenses\nand relatively small sales have resulted in increasing losses. However, during\nthe twelve-month periods ending on its two most recent quarters, Amazon has\ngenerated considerable cash from its balance sheet\u2014an astounding feat for a\ngrowing company less than four years old. 7 This places Amazon squarely in the\nEmerging Capital Efficient Company quadrant.\nFor example, in 1998, Amazon\u2019s ship-to-order business required less than $40\nmillion to stock its warehouses with books, extend credit to customers, and pre-\npay expenses. At the same time, the company generated about $120 million in\ncash by increasing its accounts payable and other forms of interest-free cash\nloans from suppliers, employees and customers. This resulted in Amazon gener-\nating $80 million in cash from reducing its net working capital. Amazingly, the\ncompany only invested approximately $26 million in fixed assets\u2014largely spent\non computers\u2014over this period. Thus, even though Amazon incurred cash\nlosses of $58 million in 1998, it generated a net of $54 million from its balance\nsheet\u2014coming very close to achieving positive free cash flow!\nThis comparison between B&N and Amazon yields two powerful insights:\n\u2022 \nAmazon\u2019s combination of earnings outflows and investment inflows is the\nexact opposite of Barnes and Noble\u2019s more traditional combination of earnings\ninflows and investment outflows. With this reversal, it is not surprising that Ama-\nzon\u2019s high valuation confuses investors who rely on conventional tests designed\nto measure the success of Old Economy companies, such as having positive and\ngrowing accounting earnings per share.\n\u2022 \nIn the past, investors anxious to own companies that \u201cjust drown you in cash\u201d\nhave naturally focused on the income statement. However, as Amazon clearly\n                                                  \n7 To make this a \u201cclean\u201d number, we have excluded investments\u2014in cash and stock\u2014in web technology-\nenabling companies that generate little or no cash earnings.\nCase Study #1:\nBarnes and Noble versus\nAmazon.com\n"

As with our previous case study, a side-by-side compari-\nson of the cash economics matrices for these two companies reveals dramati-\ncally different business models (see Figure 4).\nAlong with most successful Old Economy companies, the New York Times gen-\nerates a cash inflow from earnings and a cash outflow from investments\u2014plac-\ning it in the Profitable Buildout quadrant. In the twelve months ending on\nSeptember 27, 1998, the Times brought in $368 million in cash earnings from its\nNew York Times, Boston Globe and regional newspapers, its magazines such as\nGolf Digest, its network and radio station, and its investments in paper mills and\nthe International Herald Tribune. At the same time, the company made signifi-\ncant investments to support its earnings growth. For example, the company re-\ncently invested millions to upgrade the printing presses at its flagship New York\nTimes newspaper to transform the \u201cOld Gray Lady\u201d into a full-color newspaper.\nTogether with other investments, this resulted in a cash investment of $87 million\nduring this period.8 The New York Times is a successful and well run Old Econ-\nomy company. However, the very nature of its capital-intensive print publishing\nbusiness means that cash earnings growth will inevitably be accompanied by\ncash investments.\nIn contrast, Yahoo!\u2019s on-line publishing model means that it can reach new cus-\ntomers and grow sales without spending lots of cash. This has several benefits.\nFirst, because consumers can access web sites from any Internet connection,\nYahoo! can grow its revenues rapidly without having to endure long delays as it\nscales its physical infrastructure. This increases sales, and allows the company\nto \u201clock-in\u201d customers before other competitors acquire them. 9 Second, because\nYahoo! does not have to spend much money to serve an incremental customer,\nrevenue growth translates rapidly into higher margins. This helped Yahoo!\nachieve sales of $201 million and cash earnings of $48 million in 1998. This\ngrowth is even more impressive when compared to the company\u2019s sales of $67\nmillion and breakeven cash earnings in 1997.Further, the on-line business model\nallows the company to grow without cash-consuming investments. For example,\nthe company only spent $8 million to increase its fixed asset base in 1998, de-\nspite an increase in sales of $134 million.\nYahoo! also receives large amounts of cash from customers, suppliers and em-\nployees that are classified as increases in a balance sheet liability. For example,\none such line item\u2014deferred revenues\u2014generated $33 million in cash, as it\nballooned from $5 million in 1997 to $38 million in 1998. This line item increased\nbecause Yahoo! usually guarantees that a certain number of customers will view\nits on-line ads. Thus, even though Yahoo! receives cash up front for its online\nads, the company can not recognize this cash as revenue until the agreed-upon\nmini-\n                                                  \n8 Fortunately for shareholders, this still translated into positive free cash flow of $281 million, which helped\nfund the $422 million spent on share repurchases and dividends.\n9\u201cIn contrast, the New York Times has to invest in physical printing presses\u2014or partner with other news-\npapers\u2014to expand distribution of its flagship \u201cNational Edition\u201d to other regions. For example, it just\nannounced the expansion of daily delivery to the non-metropolitan areas of Arizona. See \u201cThe New York\nTimes Begins Printing National Edition At Phoenix Print Site\u201d.

All together, Yahoo! generated $62 million in cash in the form of in-\ncreases in deferred revenues, accounts payable and accrued expenses. At the\nsame time, the company only consumed $14 million in cash by extending ac-\ncounts receivable credit to its customers. Thus, the company\u2019s working capital\ngenerated a net of $54 million in 1998.\nThis amount more than covered the company\u2019s investment of $8 million in fixed\nassets, resulting in a net cash inflow from investments of $46 million. As the\ncompany also generated cash earnings of $48 million, Yahoo! managed to gen-\nerate a cash inflow from its income statement and balance sheet, making it one\nof the rare companies in the Super Cash Flow quadrant.\nThis case study provides three further insights about Old versus New Economy\ncompanies:\n\u2022 \nThe scalability of a New Economy company\u2019s business model means that\ncash earnings can quickly reverse from losses to profits\u2014and then grow at a\nmuch faster rate than sales. For example, Yahoo!\u2019s trailing twelve month sales\nhas grown at a 32% rate for the last 3 quarters, while its trailing cash earnings\nhave grown at 127%\u2014about four times that rate. Further, because Yahoo!\u2019s cash\ninflow from investments also grew at a similar rate, the company\u2019s overall free\ncash flow grew at 128% during this period.\n\u2022 \nCash earnings for an Old Economy company will typically overstate a com-\npany\u2019s free cash flow. For example, for the twelve months ending on September\n27, 1998, the New York Times generated free cash flow of $281 million\u2014only\n76% of its cash earnings of $368 million.\n\u2022 \nOn the other hand, cash earnings for a New Economy company like Yahoo!\ncan dramatically understate the company\u2019s total free cash flow. Indeed, Yahoo!\u2019s\nfree cash flow of $94 million in 1998 is approximately double its cash earnings of\n$48 million.\n                                                  \n10 This increase in cash will only be captured with a detailed balance sheet analysis, showing the impor-\ntance of analyzing more than a company\u2019s income statement.\n"

The core of\nthe bearish argument on AOL is that it is cash negative and requires infusions of\ncash to keep operating. The earnings they report are not real earnings because\nAOL is not really making any money, when money is defined as having free cash\nflow after tax. ... Consequently, the fact that this company expects to get cash\nneutral or cash positive in twelve months is extremely bullish.\n\u2014 Bill Miler11\nPresident, Legg Mason Fund Advisors\nCash Economics Lifecycle in the Old versus the New Economy\nAfter calculating cash economics matrices for a slew of Old and New Economy\ncompanies, it becomes evident that each category follows a distinct trend over\ntime. In fact, the pattern is so clear that we can generally say that Old Economy\ncompanies have a certain cash economics lifecycle. Further, although the cash\neconomics of New Economy companies differ dramatically from their Old Econ-\nomy counterparts, they too have their own lifecycle.\nLike all companies, Old Economy companies tend to start in the Startup quad-\nrant. However, every successful Old Economy company that we studied moved\ninto the Profitable Buildout quadrant, where it spends the majority of the rest of\nits life. A prime example of this is Wal-Mart. Like most mature and successful\ncompanies with a bricks-and-mortar infrastructure, Wal-Mart has enjoyed an in-\nflow from cash earnings, while incurring an outflow from its investments for 17\nout of its last 20 quarters (see Figure 5A).12 For example, Wal-Mart generated\n$5.4 billion from cash earnings in the twelve months ending on October 31,\n1998.\nHowever, as the company is still opening new stores and expanding internation-\nally, it also invested $3.1 billion in fixed assets during this period. Typically, Wal-\nMart also invests in working capital to support this growth. However, by paying its\nbills at a slower rate than it bought new inventory, the company achieved a\nsecular improvement in working capital management and actually generated an\nimpressive $1.4 billion. This resulted in a total cash investment outflow of ap-\nproximately $1.7 billion. In total, then, Wal-Mart generated positive free cash\nflow of $3.6 billion in this period.\nJust in case one thinks that Wal-Mart\u2019s current cash economics are a temporary\nphenomenon, we also calculated a similar matrix for the company from 1973 to\n1975 (see Figure 5B). 13 Similarly to its recent history, the Wal-Mart of this period\nwas also in the Profitable Buildout quadrant.\n                                                  \n11 \u201cBill Miller's Mutual Fund Forum.\u201d http://www.leggmason.com/Funds/fundform2.html. August 12, 1996.\n12 One point of note is that Wal-Mart did have 3 quarters\u2014the 9 months from November 1996 and until\nJuly 1997\u2014in the Super Cash Flow quadrant with cash inflows from earnings and investment. This re-\nsulted from a secular improvement in Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to generate earnings without tying up so much\ncash in working capital. Specifically, over the 12 months ending on April 30, 1997, Wal-Mart reduced\ncash tied up in current assets\u2014such as accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses\u2014by\nover $600 million, while increasing cash advances from suppliers\u2014in the form of accounts payable and\nother current liabilities\u2014by an impressive $1.9 billion. This generated over $2.5 billion in cash, which\nmore than covered its approximately $1.4 billion investment in new stores, netting an approximately\n$1.2 billion investment inflow.. Wal-Mart has continued to improve its working capital management, al-\nthough not to the extent of generating a cash investment inflow since that period.\n13 Note that while Amazon is being called the \u201cWal-Mart of the Web\u201d, it currently has drastically different\ncash economics than Wal-Mart did when its revenues were at a similar run-rate.\nCash Economics\nLifecycle of the Typical\nOld Economy Company\n"

However,\nperhaps owing to Dell\u2019s increased sales to large business accounts with longer sales and payment cy-\ncles, the company has actually invested net cash in its working capital, at least temporarily moving from\nthe Super Cash Flow to the Profitable Buildout quadrant. We do not believe that this invalidates our\nNew Economy company lifecycle theory, as it represents a start-up cost for Dell\u2019s new target market,\nrather than a continuation of growth from its familiar markets.\n"

And as Buffett notes,\nthe value of any stock is the present value of these cash flows.\nBecause New Economy companies have dramatically different cash flows than\nOld Economy companies, we would expect them to have dramatically different\nvaluations as well. To demonstrate this theoretical point, we valued a range of\ncompanies with different cash economics. Specifically, we assumed the compa-\nnies had initial cash earnings of $100, which grew at a constant rate of 15% for\n11 years. We also assumed that each company had different initial cash invest-\nment requirements\u2014ranging from a cash outflow of $(200) to a cash inflow of\n$200\u2014which also grew at a constant rate of 15% for ten years.\nWe can sum the cash earnings and investments to obtain a projected stream of\nfree cash flows for each company. Using a cost of capital of 10%, we performed\na discounted cash flow analysis to value each hypothetical company. We then\nplotted the resulting price-to-earnings ratio versus the initial cash investments for\neach company (see Figure 9).\n                                                  \n16 Letters to Shareholders. 1992. http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1992.html.\n"
