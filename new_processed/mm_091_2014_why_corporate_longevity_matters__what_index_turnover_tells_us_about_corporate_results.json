      "text": " \n \nApril 16, 2014 \n \nWhy Corporate Longevity Matters \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nNothing lasts forever. Kongo Gumi long held the distinction of being the world\u2019s oldest surviving firm. The \nJapanese company, a builder of Buddhist temples, was founded in A.D. 578 and survived until 2006. Amid a \ndecline in business and ballooning debt, the firm finally went into liquidation. Takamatsu Construction \npreserved the name by acquiring the company, but the streak of longevity was snapped.2  \n \nKongo Gumi\u2019s 1,428-year life as an independent company was incredibly rare. About one-half of all public \ncompanies die within ten years of being listed, and almost all succumb before reaching 50 years. The \ncharacteristic age of a listed company in the United States is about 8 years old. \n \nThe issue of corporate longevity is relevant for investors for a number of reasons. First, longevity is frequently \nused as a proxy for the rate of innovation. The idea is that when the economy sees a great deal of \u201ccreative \ndestruction,\u201d companies will come and go at a rapid rate as the new replaces the old.3 To the degree that it \ndoes reflect on the rate of innovation, longevity has implications for portfolio turnover and the shifts in valuation. \nAs we will see, there does appear to be a link between longevity and innovation, but mergers and acquisitions \n(M&A) explain turnover even better.  \n \nLongevity is also important for investors because it affects portfolios directly through the risk of death. For \nexample, the committee that determines the S&P 500 Index removed 81 stocks as the result of failure in the \n10 years ended 2013. These include Eastman Kodak, Lehman Brothers, and Circuit City, all formerly held in \nhigh esteem. The hazard of owning a company that fails is especially relevant for value investors. The question \nwe must answer is, \u201cWhy do most companies cease to exist?\u201d \n    \nFinally, the returns for active money managers are generally measured versus a benchmark such as the S&P \n500, which changes in composition as companies enter and leave the index. Comparing results of an active \nmanager to a benchmark makes sense because investors correctly consider returns of an index fund as an \nopportunity cost. Just as companies must earn a return on investment in excess of the opportunity cost of \ncapital to create value, so too must active managers.  \n \nThe S&P 500, with a market capitalization of $16.7 trillion as of March 31, 2014, represents about 80 \npercent of the available U.S. market capitalization and closely reflects the results of the overall market.4 More \nthan $5.7 trillion is benchmarked to the S&P 500, with pure index funds representing a little over one-quarter \nof that amount.5 Said differently, almost 40 percent of actively-managed U.S. equity mutual funds use the \nS&P 500 as a benchmark, representing well over 50 percent of assets under management.6    \n \nInvestors generally call a fund \u201cpassive\u201d if it mirrors an index like the S&P 500. But the composition of the \nS&P 500 itself varies over time, in large part reflecting the issue of corporate longevity. As a result, \nunderstanding the criteria that the S&P 500 Index committee uses, as well as the changes in the index over \ntime, can give investors insight into how to beat the benchmark. \n \nIn this report, we start by examining the turnover in the composition of the S&P 500, with a goal of \nunderstanding the causal factors behind the additions and removals. In light of these results, we consider \nwhether turnover in the S&P 500 is a reasonable proxy for innovation. We find that while we can link turnover \nto an index of innovation, M&A appears to have a larger influence on the changes. \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nApril 16, 2014 \n \nWhy Corporate Longevity Matters \n3 \nWhile others have analyzed patterns of the entries and exits, we take an additional step by analyzing the \ncharacteristics of the companies coming and going. In particular, we examine the total shareholder returns \n(TSR) for the three years before and the three years after a company is either added to, or dropped from, the \nS&P 500. We also look at the cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae\uf02a) for the same population to gauge the \nquality of the businesses.  \n \nWe find that the companies the committee adds to the S&P 500 have high trailing TSRs and above-average \nCFROIs. The companies it removes fall into two camps. Those that leave as the result of M&A have strong \ntrailing TSRs and attractive CFROIs, whereas those dropped due to failure or other factors have poor TSRs \nand CFROIs. \n \nOne intriguing finding is that in the 12 and 36 months following an action, the companies the committee \nremoves from the S&P 500 (but that continue to trade) vastly outperform the companies the committee adds. \nThis is consistent with reversion to the mean. The committee generally adds companies that have done well \nand that have high embedded expectations, and removes companies that have done poorly and hence have \nlow expectations. This sets up the scenario where the low expectations stocks outperform the high \nexpectations stocks.    \n \nThe population of the S&P 500, while economically large and significant, only represents a fraction of the \nbroader economy. As a result, we study the Fortune 500 to see whether the turnover of the S&P 500 is \nconsistent with that of other large companies. The Fortune 500 is a list of the largest companies in the U.S. \nranked by revenue and includes private companies for which there are data. We also look at longevity for \nsmaller companies via academic research and data from the U.S. Census Bureau. \n \nThe general rate of change we see for the Fortune 500 is consistent with the S&P 500. For small companies, \nthe entry rate is approximately 12-14 percent per year and the exit rate is about 10-12 percent. This means \nthat in an economy that starts with 100 companies, each year around 12-14 new companies will enter the \neconomy and 10-12 will leave, resulting in modest growth in the number of companies. There is a great deal \nof birth and death in young companies.      \n \nCorporate longevity is a key consideration for investors, but the crux of the issue is why companies die. Some \ndo indeed die as the result of obsolescence, but most bow out gracefully via a merger with another entity. And \nthose companies that are discarded from the S&P 500 and that still trade may present a small, but lucrative, \ninvestment opportunity. \n \nWhat Causes S&P 500 Turnover? \n \nExhibit 1 shows the turnover in the S&P 500 from 1958 through 2013. We use data from Compustat for \n1991 through 2013 and rely on data from Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, for the prior years.7 Over this span, the average annual turnover rate was about 4 \npercent, which means there were approximately 20 changes per year. The removal of one company and the \naddition of its replacement constitute one change. Appendix A explains how we tracked deletions and \nadditions. \n                                                 \n \n\uf02a CFROI\n\u00ae is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding the United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse \nGroup AG or its affiliates.  \n \n \n"

Perhaps the most \nstriking feature of Exhibit 1 is that the rate of turnover swings a great deal from year to year. To illustrate, the \nturnover rate was in the range of 2 to 11 percent, or 9 to 55 changes per year, from 1991 through 2013.  \n \nWhat is the source of turnover? The high turnover in some periods, such as the dot-com bubble in the late \n1990s or the financial crisis in 2008-2009, make sense and may be indicative of change in the underlying \neconomy. But in other instances, turnover tells us nothing at all about creative destruction.  \n \nFor example, the huge spike in 1976 was the result of S&P removing 40 industrial, transportation, and utility \ncompanies and replacing them with a like number of financial stocks. In 2002, the index committee removed \nseven non-U.S. companies because they failed to meet the selection criteria at that time\u2014even though some \nof the companies had been in the index for 60 years. There were eight changes in 2009 as the result of \ncompanies moving their corporate headquarters outside the U.S. in anticipation of a revision in tax laws. These \ncases underscore the limitation of simply using turnover as a proxy for innovation.8   \n \nThat said, there is a good fit in recent years between The Shift Index, a measure of innovation developed by \nconsultants at Deloitte, and turnover in the S&P 500. Exhibit 2 shows the relationship between a change in \nthe Shift Index and turnover in the S&P 500 from 1994 through 2012. The correlation coefficient (r) is 0.65. \nThe Shift Index is itself made up of three component indexes. The \u201cfoundation index\u201d captures public policy, \ninfrastructure penetration, and technology performance. The \u201cflow index\u201d reflects virtual and physical flows, as \nwell as amplifiers such as social media. The \u201cimpact index\u201d takes into consideration markets, firms, and people. \nTogether, these indexes are meant to quantify broader economic change.9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n1958\n1961\n1964\n1967\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\nNumber of Changes\nTurnover\nAverage\nTrend line\n"

To answer this, we examined why the committee removed stocks from the S&P 500. Appendix B \nprovides a detailed discussion of the basis for additions to, and removals from, the index. Additions must meet \nspecific criteria while the committee has greater discretion in the decision to remove a company.   \n \nThe grounds for removal from the S&P 500 fall into three categories: \u201cM&A,\u201d \u201cFailure,\u201d and \u201cOther.\u201d M&A \nincludes mergers, acquisitions, and companies that go private. We exclude other strategic deals such as spin-\noffs to shareholders or other forms of dividing a company.   \n \nFailures consist primarily of companies the committee dropped from the index following a bankruptcy filing or \nfor failure to maintain a sufficient market capitalization.10 \n \nThe \u201cOther\u201d category consists mostly of two groups. First are companies that realized a large decline in market \ncapitalization for reasons unrelated to performance, including special dividends or spin-offs. The second group \nincludes companies that S&P removed for moving their domiciles outside the U.S. \n \nWe systematically place each removal from the index, from 2002-2013, into a category based on the \ninformation that S&P provided. This analysis reveals that M&A, not failures, drives the majority of turnover in \nthe index. Exhibit 3 shows that more than half the removals are the result of M&A while only about one-third \nare from failure. The other category was just over one-tenth of the sample. Most failures were the \nconsequence of a decline in market capitalization, not bankruptcy. See Appendix C for a full log of these \nchanges and the reasons for each removal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\nS&P 500\nShift Index\n"

      "text": " \n \nApril 16, 2014 \n \nWhy Corporate Longevity Matters \n7 \nThese categories reveal the limitations of simply associating turnover with creative destruction. For example, it \nis not accurate to say that a company \u201cfailed\u201d if the S&P committee removed it following a divestiture that \nshrunk the company\u2019s market capitalization below a threshold level. Likewise, it\u2019s hard to say that creative \ndestruction was the reason the committee had to remove a company after it was acquired for its strong growth \nand profitability.  \n \nThe Characteristics of Companies Added to, and Removed from, the S&P 500 \n \nThe next step of our study was an analysis of the characteristics of the companies added and removed from \nthe S&P 500. In particular, we focused on two measures. The first is three- and one-year total shareholder \nreturn (TSR), relative to the S&P 500, before the change and one and three years following the change. TSR \nis the return an investor earns for a stock given the change in price and assuming that all dividends are \nreinvested. We subtract the return for the S&P 500 from each company\u2019s TSR to calculate relative TSR.  \n \nThe second measure is the three- and one-year cash flow return on investment (CFROI) before the change \nand one and three years following the change. CFROI is a measure of the return a company earns on the \ncash it invests in its business. Because CFROI is adjusted for inflation, you can compare it over time without \nfear of distortion. Appendix D provides detail on the sample sizes of the various categories. \n \nExhibit 5 summarizes our observations about TSR.12 To begin, the S&P committee tends to add companies \nthat have shown strong past stock price results. The companies added in the 12 years ended in 2013 had an \naverage relative TSR of 29 percent per year for the 3 years before inclusion and of 28 percent for the year \nprior to inclusion. The median returns, while more modest, were similarly high. In this way, the committee \nbehaves in a way that is consistent with other investors\u2014they seek success.13  \n \nExhibit 5: Trailing and Future TSRs for Additions and Removals from S&P 500 \n \nSource: FactSet, S&P Dow Jones Indices. \nNote: The data cover all changes to the index from 2002-2013. \n \nThe companies that were removed had three- and one-year returns that were essentially equal to the S&P \n500. Naturally, the TSRs reflect the reason the committee had to drop a company. (See Exhibit 6.) The \ncompanies that left as the result of M&A had average relative returns of 9 percent for three years and 23 \npercent for one year. Most of the companies that leave the S&P 500 do so after having outperformed the \nindex itself.  \n \nCompanies that failed, of course, fared poorly prior to exclusion. Those companies had average relative \nreturns of -24 percent for three years and -39 percent for one year. Companies that left the index for other \nreasons had returns roughly in line with that of the S&P 500. For each type, the median returns are similar to \nthose for the mean. So, companies that were acquired had excellent relative TSRs, companies that failed had \npoor TSRs, and the other companies performed in line with the market.        \n-3 Year \nCAGR\n-1 Year\n+1 Year\n+3 Year \nCAGR\nAdded\n29%\n28%\n-1%\n2%\nRemoved\n-1%\n0%\n38%\n27%\nAdded\n18%\n23%\n-3%\n1%\nRemoved\n-3%\n5%\n5%\n0%\nMedian\nTSR Relative to S&P 500\nMean\n"

Exhibit 7 shows that the average TSRs for the companies the committee \nremoved from the S&P 500, but that continued to trade publicly, trounced those of the companies the \ncommittee added.14 One year after a change, the average relative TSR for the companies the committee \nadded was -1 percent while the TSR for the companies removed was 38 percent.

The mean CFROI for \nthe three years prior to removal was 7.5 percent, and the CFROI in the year before removal was an even \nlower 4.2 percent. But, the average CFROIs for the removed companies belie the results based on why they \nwere removed. \n \nExhibit 8: Trailing and Future CFROIs for Additions and Removals from S&P 500 \n \nSource: FactSet, S&P Dow Jones Indices, Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae. \nNote: The data cover all changes to the index from 2002-2013. \n \nCompanies removed as the result of M&A had trailing three-year average CFROIs above the rest of the \nmarket. This is consistent with prior research that suggests firms with large free cash flows are attractive \ntakeover targets.16 This means that the companies removed because of failure or \u201cother\u201d had CFROIs way \nbelow the average. The CFROIs for these companies in the one year and three years following removal, at \naround six percent, are consistent with businesses that are subpar in quality. \n \nIn summary, the S&P 500 committee adds stocks of companies that have achieved good recent TSRs and \nthat are of above-average quality. Those companies continue to earn high CFROIs, but their stocks, on \naverage, generate TSRs roughly in line with the market in the one and three years following addition. \n \nOf the companies removed, there are two tales. The stocks of companies that are acquired, which represent a \nmajority of removals, have TSRs and CFROIs that are well above the market prior to leaving the S&P.  \n \nThe stocks of the companies categorized as failures, slightly above one-third of our sample, have abysmal \nTSRs prior to removal but superb TSRs after removal.

But the trend is flat over the past decade and down \nsharply if we start at 2000. \n \nExhibit 9: Fortune 500 Turnover \n \nSource: Fortune, Credit Suisse Research. \n \nExhibit 10 presents another view of longevity for the large companies on the list.18 We select five starting \nyears\u20141955, 1965, 1975, 1985, and 1995\u2014and track what number of the original 500 companies for \nthose years remain on the list annually for subsequent years.19 For example, 362 of 500 companies on the \n1955 list remained there 10 years later. After 15 years, only 294 of the 500 were still on the list. After 35 \nyears, just 170 of the 500 made the list. The steeper the slope of the line\u2019s decline, the more rapidly \ncompanies disappear from the list. The lines that start at more recent dates do appear to drop faster, showing \nthat there is indeed acceleration in turnover for the Fortune 500. It\u2019s harder to remain among the ranks of the \nlargest companies today than it was in past generations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n1955\n1958\n1961\n1964\n1967\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\nNumber of Changes\nTurnover\nAverage\nTrend line\n"

      "text": " \n \nApril 16, 2014 \n \nWhy Corporate Longevity Matters \n12 \nLeslie Hannah, a professor at the London School of Economics, studied corporate longevity in detail.20 \nHannah started with the 100 largest companies in the world, as measured by market capitalization, in 1912 \nand figured out where they were in 1995. He found that 52 companies had survived and 48 had disappeared. \nOf the survivors, 19 remained in the top 100. Of those that disappeared, 29 went bankrupt or suffered a \nsimilar plight, including liquidation, bankruptcy protection, extensive corporate breakup, or nationalization. \n \nBroadening the Sample\u2014From Big to Small \n \nWe have focused on big corporations because they reflect the overall economy and represent a large fraction \nof the investable universe. Investors are focused on those companies with good reason. In the U.S. today, \nthere are 5.7 million total firms and just more than 5,000 stocks trade on major exchanges.21  \n \nThe pattern for the largest firms also exists for smaller firms and, if anything, the issue of longevity is more \nacute for small firms. Timothy Dunne, Mark Roberts, and Larry Samuelson, a trio of economists, did a \nsweeping study of corporate longevity, including entry and exit rates. Their analysis of more than 250,000 U.S. \nmanufacturing firms showed that roughly 35 percent of firms that enter an industry exit within 5 years, and \nthat about 80 percent of entrants exit within 10 years.22 \n \nExhibit 12 shows the rate of entry and exit for U.S. establishments across all industries since 1977, using the \nU.S. Census\u2019s Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS). Most studies on corporate demography use \nestablishments, a rough proxy for firms, as the unit of analysis because that is the way the Census Bureau \ncollects and reports the data.  \n \nA useful way to think about entry and exit is to imagine an industry with 100 firms today. Based on the \naverage annual rates over the past decade, roughly 12-14 new firms will enter the industry and 10-12 firms \nwill leave in one year. This leads to modest growth in the total number of firms on average. Because entry \nrates typically exceed exit rates, the number of establishments in the U.S. increases over time. \n \nThe most recent data disclosed by the BDS show that approximately 25 percent of establishments fail within \nthe first year and just over one-half fail within five years.23 Mortality rates are high for young companies and \ndecline for companies that reach adolescence. \n \nExhibit 12: Establishment Entry and Exit Rates, 1977-2010 (United States) \n \nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies, Business Dynamics Statistics, Credit Suisse Research. \n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n1977 1981 1985 1989 1993 1997 2001 2005 2009\nEntry Rate\nExit Rate\n"

      "text": " \n \nApril 16, 2014 \n \nWhy Corporate Longevity Matters \n13 \nConclusion  \n \nCorporate longevity is important for investors for a handful of reasons. First, if longevity is contracting then \ninvestors need to rethink valuation, position sizing within a portfolio, and the magnitude of sustainable \ncompetitive advantage. Our analysis shows that while turnover in the S&P 500, a proxy for longevity, is \nreasonably well correlated to an index of innovation, the turnover is even better correlated to M&A activity. \nThat innovation and M&A are linked makes sense, but we also know that other factors, including capital \navailability, stock prices, and the institutional imperative, influence M&A waves.  \n \nOn balance, turnover for the S&P 500 and Fortune 500 is rising, but not at a rate that is dramatic. A better \ndescription is that turnover comes in waves. Further, changes in criteria contaminate the turnover results.    \n \nAnother reason that investors need to understand longevity is to assess the risk of failure for stocks within \ntheir portfolio. This is especially pertinent for investors in value and small capitalization stocks. About one-third \nof the removals from the S&P 500 over time have been companies we categorize as failures. These \ncompanies have poor TSRs and below-average CFROIs. Since these stocks are often inexpensive, they can \nrepresent value traps. The data also show that young companies, which are generally small, tend to have a \nhigher mortality rate than companies that make it to adolescence. \n \nFinally, investors who have their results compared to a benchmark need to appreciate how that benchmark \nchanges. While most investors consider index funds to be passive, the indexes themselves change quite a bit \nover time. Note that the S&P beats roughly 60 percent of active managers in an average year and does so \nwithout any trading, macro forecasting, or limits on position or sector size.  \n \nThe S&P 500 committee presents a very attractive trading strategy. Using historical numbers, investors who \nbought the stocks that the committee removed from the S&P 500 (that still traded) and who sold short the \nstocks entering the S&P 500 would have earned a tidy excess return. It appears the S&P 500 committee \nbehaves in a way that many investors do: It buys high and sells low. \n \n"

The authors examine the average \ntenure of a company in the S&P 500 over time and conclude that the rate of churn has accelerated. Their \nstudy spans from the late 1920s through the late 1990s. Because the S&P 500 wasn\u2019t formed until 1957, \nthey use the S&P 90 as a proxy in the early years. They show that turnover increased from about 1.5 percent \nin the 1920s and 1930s, an average lifespan of about 65 years, to nearly 10 percent in 1998, an average \nlifespan of 10 years. \nFoster and Kaplan attribute this increase in the rate of change to Peter Drucker\u2019s notion of the \u201cAge of \nDiscontinuity\u201d and Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s theory of creative destruction. These frameworks, the authors argue, \nshow how markets promote discontinuity by having new, more innovative entrants replace old, weaker \ncompanies.

A small number of failures were delisted by an exchange or failed to meet profit criteria. \n11 Peter Clark and Roger Mills argue that merger waves generally pick up steam alongside an improving \neconomy, in large part because this increases the availability of financing. The authors attribute the biggest \nflurry of activity to behavioral factors, or what Warren Buffett likes to call the \u201cinstitutional imperative.\u201d CEOs \nsee their peers doing deals and feel compelled to do deals of their own, even if valuations have already risen \nbeyond levels that are attractive. See: Peter J. Clark and Roger W. Mills, Masterminding the Deal: \nBreakthroughs in M&A strategy and analysis (London: KoganPage, 2013); Jarrod Harford attributes merger \nwaves to industry shocks, an increase in capital liquidity, and a reduction in financing constraints. See Jarrod \nHarford, \u201cWhat Drives Merger Waves?\u201d Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 77, No. 3, September 2005, \n529-560.

They found that stocks deleted from \nthe index had average abnormal returns of -77 percent over the two years prior to removal, while stocks \nadded to the index saw average abnormal returns of 290 percent for the two years prior to their introduction. \nSee Messod Beneish and Robert E.

They attribute the positive results for added \nstocks to \u201cincreases in institutional ownership, liquidity, and analyst coverage, and a decrease in the long-term \nshadow cost,\u201d and for deleted stocks to \u201ca rebound in institutional ownership and liquidity after stock deletion.\u201d \nThey note that \u201cthe long-term operating performance declines for added stocks and increases slightly for \ndeleted stocks subsequent to the year of stock addition or deletion (year t),\u201d suggesting that \u201cfirms are added \nto the index during their peak performance stage and cannot sustain this performance in the long-run.

Anita Arora, Lauren Capp, and Gary Smith found similar results for the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage. The authors examined all additions and deletions to the Dow since 1928, excluding changes due to \nM&A or due purely to a name change. They created two portfolios, one of added stocks and one of deleted \nstocks, and then tracked their performance, accounting for changes to the Dow over time. The authors found \nthe deleted stocks, with annual returns of 15.8 percent, handily beat the added stocks, with annual returns of \n11.4 percent. The authors conclude that the results are statistically significant and cannot be explained by \nCarhart\u2019s four-factor model (CAPM, size, valuation, and momentum).

So, to identify additions and deletions to the \nindex, we compare the CUSIPs of all members in one year to the CUSIPs in the following year. A stock\u2019s \nCUSIP allows us to trace a stock\u2019s lineage even if it has changed its name or ticker. \n \nDetermining the changes in the index range from the simple to the complex. For our period of analysis, some \nCUSIPs, such as that of Johnson & Johnson, were in the index every year and were tied to the same ticker \nand corporate name the whole time. Then there were examples like the CUSIP for Apple, Inc., which was tied \nto Apple Computer until the company changed its name in 2007. And finally, there were more complex \nexamples that not only demonstrate the dynamic elements of our economy, but also show how the Standard & \nPoor\u2019s committee tries to capture and reflect such change. \n \nA merger is a good example. In December 1999, Monsanto and Pharmacia & Upjohn agreed to merge and \nform Pharmacia Corporation. In March 2000, S&P announced that it was going to remove Monsanto and \nPharmacia & Upjohn from the S&P 500 Index and replace them with Pharmacia Corporation and Linear \nTechnology. While this appears to be two changes to the index (i.e., two add/remove events), we only count it \nas one because Monsanto\u2019s CUSIP lived on in the combined entity. So, the only change is the replacement of \nPharmacia & Upjohn (71694110) with Linear Technology Corporation (53567810). \n \nRemoved:  \nMonsanto Company (71713U10) and Pharmacia & Upjohn (71694110) \nAdded: \nPharmacia Corp (71713U10) and Linear Technology (53567810) \n \nMethodology for determining which fiscal years to use in calculating trailing and future CFROIs: \n \nThe year in which the committee makes a change to the index is the first year of the trailing CFROI calculation. \nFor example, here\u2019s how we calculate trailing and future CFROIs for a company that the committee added or \nremoved at any point during 2004. \n \n-3-year:   \nAverage of fiscal years 2002-2004  \n-1-year:   \nFiscal year 2004 \n+1-year:   \nFiscal year 2005 \n+ 3-year:  \nAverage of fiscal years 2005-2007 \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nApril 16, 2014 \n \nWhy Corporate Longevity Matters \n18 \nAppendix B \n \nHere\u2019s a look at how S&P constructs and oversees the index. The criteria for additions are more \nstraightforward than the grounds for removal. While the committee has some discretion in the companies they \nselect, additions must satisfy a list of criteria for eligibility including standards for market capitalization, liquidity, \ndomicile, public float, and earnings quality. Here are the attributes as of March 2014:24  \n \uf402\n Universe: Domiciled in the U.S.  \uf402\n Market Capitalization: $4.6 billion or greater. \uf402\n Public Float: A minimum of 50 percent of shares outstanding available for trading. \uf402\n Financial Viability: Positive reported earnings in the most recent quarter and over the most recent four \nquarters (in aggregate). \uf402\n Liquidity and Price: Highly tradable stocks with active and deep markets. More specifically, \u201cthe ratio of \nannual dollar value traded to float adjusted market capitalization should be 1.00 or greater, and the \ncompany should trade a minimum of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the \nevaluation date.\u201d \n \nThe grounds for removal, except in the case of M&A, are not as clear. For example, the committee may leave \nalone an index constituent that violates one of the criteria for addition, as meeting all the criteria is not \nnecessary for continued membership. Through much of the index\u2019s history, the S&P committee only modified \nthe list of companies when it had to remove a stock for reasons including bankruptcy or acquisition.  \n \nS&P made an important change to its methodology in 1996. The committee started to manage the index \nmore actively by removing firms that no longer effectively represented the U.S. market or the industry in which \nit operated. This change alone explains a significant portion of the increase in turnover. We estimate that a \nmeaningful fraction of the removals over the past decade would not have occurred absent this methodological \nchange.  \n \nS&P\u2019s primer on methodology reveals a tension between a passive and an active approach. On the one hand, \nS&P states that \u201cturnover in index membership should be avoided when possible.\u201d On the other hand, S&P \nsays it intends the index \u201cto reflect the U.S. equity markets and . . . the U.S. economy\u201d and to include \u201c500 of \nthe top companies in the leading industries of the U.S. economy.\u201d The S&P 500 Index does not simply include \nonly the largest companies in the U.S., though, and many of its constituents are not in the top 500 as \nmeasured by either market capitalization or sales. To meet the goal of having the top companies, some \nturnover is clearly inevitable and prompts the S&P committee to continually revise the index.  \n \n \n"

It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary quantitative \nalgorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all the companies included \nin its database. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default variables and incorporated into the \nalgorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and earnings data provided by outside data vendors are \nsubject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying economics of firm performance. These adjustments provide \nconsistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies across industries or national borders. The default scenario that is \nproduced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline valuation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce \nalternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request.  \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation \nmodel establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default variables may also \nbe adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on \nrequest.  \nThis document may not be reproduced either in whole, or in part, without the written permission of the authors and CREDIT SUISSE.  \n \n\u00a9 2014 CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG and/or its affiliates.
