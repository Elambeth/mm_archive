      "text": "Frontiers of Finance\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nIn this report we present a comprehensive framework for analyzing employee stock\noption (ESO) programs. While ESOs have been the subject of a great deal of\ncommentary, economic rigor has been absent in many of these discussions. We\npresent what we believe is the most in-depth, financially sound, and usable de-\nscription of ESOs to date. The major points of our analysis are as follows:\n\u2022 There is a huge gap between economic reality and accounting convention in\ndealing with ESOs. Traditional reckoning for options starts and stops with \u201cdi-\nluted\u201d shares, which do not consider either out-of-the money options or the time\nvalue of options. Accordingly, current financial statements are of limited help in\nunderstanding the impact of ESOs on corporate value. Proper use of FASB 123-\nmandated information, often buried in the footnotes, is required to appreciate the\neconomic impact of ESOs.\n\u2022 Options that have already been granted should be treated as an economic li-\nability for ongoing shareholders. These options are valued using a Black-Scholes\npricing model\u2014subject to some modifications\u2014 and are subtracted from corporate\nvalue in determining shareholder value. Further, historical option grants convey\nimportant information about the total economic cost of employee compensation.\n\u2022 Future option grants should be considered in the valuation process. We prefer\nto treat future option grants as an expense, similar to any other income statement\nexpense. The result is lower earnings estimates for future years. Alternatively, we\nleave the income statement value drivers as they are, but subtract the present value\nof future option \u201cexpenses\u201d from corporate value. Once past and future ESO val-\nues are quantified, their role in valuation becomes completely transparent.\n\u2022 The surge in ESOs is a symptom of the \u201cNew Economy.\u201d New economy com-\npanies are knowledge-focused. In contrast, old economy businesses are capital-\nfocused. People are becoming the main source of competitive advantage, and peo-\nple want something that capital never asked for: a piece of the action. In our view,\nthis trend toward more equity-based compensation in new economy businesses is\nintractable. Hence, it is more important than ever to understand option programs\nand their impact on corporate value.\n\u2022 The timing of option pricings and re-pricings offers interesting signals. Un-\nfortunately, there does not appear to be a systematic way to exploit these signals.\nManagers often price options ahead of the announcement of good news\u2014and sub-\nsequent excess share price returns. But the lag between when the pricings occur\nand when they are disclosed makes the information unactionable. Separately, man-\nagers tend to reprice their options following a period of dismal share price per-\nformance\u2014the evidence shows that they are good at picking the bottom.\nUnfortunately, ensuing stock price action tends to be in line with the market, ne-\ngating the potential for finding outsized returns.\n\u2022 There are a host of economic reasons to use ESOs. These include a reduction\nin agency costs, enhanced corporate liquidity, and direct equity participation for\ntalented employees. ESOs should only be a concern for shareholders when the per-\nformance bar is set too low\u2014that is, there is not enough \u201cincentive\u201d in incentive\ncompensation.\nSummary\n"

The spectacular\nbull market of the last few years has helped executives like AOL\u2019s Steve Case and\nCompaq\u2019s Eckhard Pfeiffer get richer\u2014along with option hall-of-famers like Dis-\nney\u2019s Michael Eisner, Heinz\u2019s Anthony O\u2019Reilly, and the entire Microsoft execu-\ntive suite. And it doesn\u2019t take a careful reader of annual reports to notice the large\nstock option grants awarded to executives, managers, and even the rank and file.\nThe flow of so much wealth to employees signifies an important shift in our new\nglobal economy. Intellectual capital\u2014harnessed brainpower\u2014has increasingly\nreplaced the bricks and mortar of physical capital. In our fast-paced, wired world,\npeople have become the new foundation for competitive advantage. And people\nwant something bricks and mortar never asked for: a piece of the action. That\nmeans equity ownership\u2014and lots of employee stock options.1\nWith this surge in the use of employee stock options, it is more important than ever\nto analyze employee stock options properly. Indeed, a proper accounting for the\neconomic costs of options materially affects almost all key drivers used to value\nstocks. However, the intimidating swirl of mathematics surrounding option valua-\ntion has hindered understanding of how options affect shareholder value (see Ap-\npendix A for a short primer on the drivers of option value). In addition, traditional\noptions analysis starts and stops with earnings per share dilution, which at best\ngives an incomplete picture of economic reality.\nThis report seeks to shed some light on this issue. It is organized into six parts.\n\u2022 First, we discuss the secular shifts in the economy that make employees demand\noptions and the economic incentives that make companies increasingly willing to\ngrant them. We also elaborate on the major types of ESOs commonly used. Fi-\nnally, we also examine whether options grants provide a signal about manage-\nment\u2019s confidence in a company\u2019s future\u2014and whether we can use this knowledge\nto make money.\n\u2022 Second, we look at how current accounting practice distorts economy reality. As\nwith other reports in the Frontiers of Finance series, our focus is on the eco-\nnomic\u2014not the accounting\u2014consequences of corporate decisions.\n\u2022 Third, we explain how to correct part of this distortion by treating outstanding\nESOs as an economic liability, and show how this adjustment affects shareholder\nvalue.\n\u2022 Fourth, we explore a technique for recognizing future option grants. This treat-\nment of \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d options represents economic reality much more faithfully\nthan the accounting alternative.\n\u2022 Fifth, since these adjustments change important inputs into the discounted cash\nflow equation, we explain how they affect an investor\u2019s understanding of intrinsic\nvalue and market expectations.\n\u2022 Finally, we analyze \u201crepricing,\u201d which occurs when a company lowers the exer-\ncise price of an option following a sharp drop in the company\u2019s share price.\nFollowing the Conclusion, there are a series of Appendices that provide the practi-\ncal details needed to undertake a value-based analysis of a company\u2019s employee\nIntroduction\n"

There is also a Glossary that defines key terms used\nthroughout the report.\nThe Evolution of the New Economy\nThe growth in ESOs is a symptom of more profound changes occurring within the\neconomy. For much of the last century, the industries of resource extraction and\nmass production\u2014powered by the combustion engine, electricity, and the assembly\nline\u2014have defined how our economy works. The products of this economy tend to\nbe what economist Brian Arthur calls \u201ccongealed resources\u201d\u2014lots of extracted\nresources turned into products with only a little knowledge.2 Most of the major\nproducts of the nineteenth and early twentieth century such as coal, tobacco, and\noil\u2014and even early planes, trains, and automobiles\u2014generally fit this description.\nIn this world, the owners of those congealed resources and the means of processing\nthem captured much of the Industrial Revolution\u2019s newfound wealth. As Marx\nwould put it, the real winners were the owners of the means of production (see Ta-\nble 1).3 Indeed, the very concept of an assembly line\u2014with repetitious simple jobs\nperformed by workers who were interchangeable with one another\u2014left very little\nroom for value-adding innovation for the average employee.4 Since labor served as\nan easily replaceable resource, companies generally paid employees an hourly\nwage or fixed salary for their services.\nTable 1\n5 Richest Americans in History Owned the Means of Production in the \u201cOld Economy\u201d\nRank\nTycoon\nSource of Fortune\nWealth as % of GNP\n1\n John D. Rockefeller\n Oil\n1.53%\n2\n Cornelius Vanderbilt\n Steamboats and railroads\n1.15%\n3\n John Jacob Astor\n Fur trade, NY real estate\n0.93%\n4\n Stephen Girard\n Shipping\n0.67%\n5\n Andrew Carnegie\n Steel\n0.60%\nNote: Wealth figures calculated by dividing a person\u2019s total wealth by America\u2019s GNP at the time of the person\u2019s death.\nSource: The Wealthy 100, Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther.5\nThe economy has clearly evolved from one focused on congealed resources. For\nexample, look at three recent successful products\u2014Pfizer\u2019s Viagra, Microsoft\u2019s\nWindows, or Disney\u2019s Lion King. These products are created not in a factory, but\nin the heads of knowledge workers in the lab, on the computer, or in the studio. To\nuse Brian Arthur\u2019s term, these products are \u201ccongealed knowledge\u201d\u2014lots of\nknowledge with very little physical resources added into the mix. The advent of\never more powerful silicon, cheap software, and connectivity has only increased\nthe value of smart minds.\nIn this world, workers no longer serve as interchangeable cogs in a great industrial\nmachine. While one bicep is easily replaced with another, each brain possesses\npotential unique knowledge and skills. Indeed, for many knowledge-intensive com-\npanies, the entire value of the firm disappears when employees go home for the\nnight. As Bill Gates says, \u201cIn today's emerging information society, the critical\nnatural resources are human intelligence, skill, and leadership.\u201d6\nUnfortunately for shareholders, companies can only rent employees\u2014they cannot\nown them. Increasingly, knowledge workers have alternatives. They can either join\nfirms where they receive direct ownership in return for their efforts, or they can\nstart their own company. In a competitive labor market, then, employees demand\n1. Why Options Are\nRelevant\n"

However, corporations and investors also have\neconomic incentives to provide options to managers and employees:\n\u2022 \nReduce agency costs. Ideally, corporate managers\u2014as the agents of share-\nholders\u2014will act to maximize value. However, the world is not ideal: rational\nmanagers may choose instead to maximize their own happiness by arranging valu-\nable perquisites, building costly \u201cempires\u201d or taking value-destroying actions that\nserve to entrench them.\nTo counter this problem, managers often receive large grants of stock or options in\norder to align their interests with those of shareholders\u2019. For example, given an\nincrease in firm value of $1,000, the wealth of the average CEO in 1994 increased\nby $39\u2014over three times the $12 amount in 1980. Part of this heightened sensi-\ntivity to changes in firm value comes from the increased stock holdings of the av-\nerage CEO. However, the surge of ESO plans has also driven this trend, as a grant\nof ESOs has approximately double the pay-to-performance sensitivity as a grant of\nstock with the same value.8\n\u2022 \nRecruit and retain employees. All things equal, companies that can recruit and\nretain the best people will win in the marketplace. Large grants of employee stock\noptions can help companies attract the best and the brightest. Furthermore, ESOs\ncan help retain valuable employees by serving as \u201cgolden handcuffs.\u201d ESOs give\nemployees a reason to stay until their options \u201cvest,\u201d which typically takes four or\nfive years. Moreover, since most companies grant ESOs annually, an employee\nwho leaves a firm will have to walk away from valuable unvested options.\n\u2022 \nLiquidity. Options serve as a noncash form of compensation for cash-strapped\ncompanies\u2014such as startups\u2014that can ill afford to pay costly salaries to its em-\nployees.\n\u2022 \nTaxes. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 created an economic incentive\nfor corporations to pay its executives with options by limiting the deductibility of\ncash salaries larger than $1,000,000.9 Because the IRS categorizes ESOs as \u201cob-\njectively determined performance-based compensation,\u201d companies can deduct the\nintrinsic value of an option in the year in which an employee exercises it (see Ap-\npendix F). Thus, for companies with high-priced executive talent, using ESOs\u2014or\nat least, some form of objectively determined performance-based compensation\ninstead of subjectively determined cash bonuses\u2014may represent an optimal tax\nstrategy.\n\u2022 \nMarket-linked versus short-term accounting-based compensation. Some\ncompanies compensate their executives based on the attainment of certain tar-\ngets\u2014such as surpassing a particular level of earnings per share or return on eq-\nuity. However, for companies with highly volatile results, these financial\nperformance metrics may serve as a poor measure of the quality of managerial\ndecisions. For example, managers may take actions that lower earnings in a given\nyear, but position the firm to earn higher earnings in the future. Using a market-\n"

Reflecting arbitrary accounting regulations, a firm\nthat replaces executives\u2019 cash salaries with at-the-money options maximizes its\nreported earnings per share. An economic reason for doing this is to avoid violat-\ning a debt covenant. In addition, a self-interested manager may do this to achieve a\ncertain accounting target or to try to fool the market with artificially higher re-\nported earnings.\nTypes of Employee Stock Options\nBefore we go further, we should define the major types of ESOs commonly granted\nto employees and executives. While theoretical possibilities are infinite, in practice,\ncertain kinds of ESOs are more popular:\n\u2022 \nAt-the-money ESOs. The vast majority of options are issued at-the-money.\nThis is because accounting regulations state that granting an ESO creates an ex-\npense equal to the difference between a company\u2019s share price and the option\u2019s\nfixed exercise price. If a company grants at-the-money options, it need not recog-\nnize the ESO as an accounting expense at all. Also, shareholders usually balk at\noptions that allow managers to purchase shares at a discount to the market price.\nFor these reasons, companies rarely issue in-the-money options.\nIn our survey of companies\u2019 proxies and annual reports, we found that most ESO\ncontracts have a ten-year life and vest in equal proportions over four or five years.\n\u2022 \nDeep-out-of-the-money ESOs. In order to create an incentive to dramatically\nincrease the value of the firm, companies sometimes grant deep-out-of-the-money\nESOs. That way, managers can profitably exercise their options only if they hit a\nhome run for shareholders. Also, like at-the-money options, accountants view these\noptions as a free gift.\nIt is important to note that they must be very deep out-of-money options to ensure\nexecutives only profit when their stock outperforms the market. This is because\nmost companies grant ESOs with a 10-year life. Thus, even a very deep-out-of-\nthe-money ESO\u2014with an exercise price at a 100% premium to the market price\u2014\nonly requires annual share price appreciation of 7.2% to become in-the-money.\nThis is significantly below the 9% to 12% return desired by most equity investors\nin public companies.\nHowever, given that executives often have substantial wealth tied up in a single\nundiversified company, they may be averse to assuming the risk inherent in these\ndeep-out-of-the-money ESOs. When these options are used at all, then, they tend to\nbe granted in large blocks to new CEOs of companies whose boards are dominated\nby a few shareholders, such as a leveraged buy out (LBO) firm.\n\u2022 \nESOs with an indexed exercised price. These ESOs have exercise prices that\nare matched to the performance of a broader market index\u2014usually the S&P 500\nor an industry index. These ESOs have three features that make them tremen-\ndously appealing to shareholders. First, they only reward managers who outper-\nform the market. If a company uses these options, there is no risk that mediocre or\neven poor managers will be overcompensated as a result of a bull market. Second,\nbecause the strike price is not fixed and tends to rise every year, an indexed ESO\ngrant will transfer less value than a conventional ESO grant. Third, indexed ESOs\n"

The rules\nstipulate that indexed ESOs are \u201cvariable plans\u201d and must be treated differently\nfrom ordinary ESOs, which are \u201cfixed plans.\u201d According to this syllogism, ac-\ncountants expense the annual difference in the intrinsic value of vested indexed\noptions. Thus, to the horror of managers, the better the stock does, the worse the\ncompany\u2019s reported earnings.10 This is a problem since earnings-based annual and\nlong-term incentive plans typically comprise 37% of a CEO\u2019s compensation.11 De-\nspite the economic benefits to the firm, then, unfavorable accounting deters most\ncompanies from using indexed ESOs.\n\u2022 \nStock appreciation rights (SARs). Although SARs are not technically em-\nployee stock options, we include them here because companies often use them in a\nlike manner. SARs provide employees with cash payments equal to the apprecia-\ntion of the company\u2019s stock over a specified duration. Thus, like options, SARs\nprovide employees with equity upside without exposure to any downside. Unlike\noptions, SARs result in periodic payments of cash to the executives over the\nSAR\u2019s life. However, managers tend to avoid using SARs as they are subject to\nthe same accounting treatment as indexed options.\nOptions as a Signal\nCompanies issue options for a variety of reasons\u2014some good and some bad. For\nexample, a large option grant to a CEO may be motivation to create value for\nshareholders. Just as plausibly, the option grant may be used to artificially increase\nearnings per share to \u201cmake one more quarterly number.\u201d12\nOwing to this ambiguity, investors seeking to analyze option grants to \u201cbeat the\nmarket\u201d must do more than crunch numbers from a proxy statement\u2014they must\nunderstand the intent of an option grant. In our experience and review of the aca-\ndemic literature, two things emerge. First, in analyzing the strength of a signal\nprovided by an option grant, we must look not at ESOs in general, but at the stock\noptions given to executives who have the greatest ability to affect firm value. Sec-\nond, we find that most of the strong market signals associated with executive op-\ntion grants is due to two things:\n\u2022 \nReducing agency costs and managerial incentives. Many firms generate cash\nwell in excess of the amount needed to fund all positive-NPV projects. However,\nthe history of corporate America is rife with examples of managers misspending\nthis excess cash on value-destructive projects. Harvard Business School Professor\nMichael Jensen has suggested that one way to lower wasteful spending is to use\nfinancial leverage. High debt levels force managers to use all excess cash gener-\nated to service high interest and principal payments and effectively takes the punch\nbowl away before the party starts. As this strategy focuses on not wasting cash, it\nworks best with a mature company with stable cash flows.13\nHowever, increased leverage comes at the cost of financial flexibility. And, lever-\nage cannot be used to reduce agency costs for companies without the stable and\npositive cash flows needed to service debt. Paying out cash would be disastrous for\nmost startups as they need to retain earnings for growth. For these companies,\nthen, a board of directors trying to minimize agency costs cannot just lever up the\nfirm\u2014they must award managers for value-creating growth.\n"

But options do something\nthat leverage does not: they give managers an incentive to increase the value of the\nfirm. Thus, large grants of executive stock options can be a positive signal that a\ncompany may try to ramp up for profitable growth, especially for companies that\nhave not historically rewarded performance with higher pay.\nIt is important to note that not all option grants are created equal. The intensity of\nthe market signal provided by option grants is a reflection of how hard managers\nmust work to make their options profitable. For example, indexed ESOs that re-\nquire managers to outperform the broader market send a much stronger signal than\ndo ordinary ESOs. After all, if a company\u2019s stock simply appreciates at the cost of\nequity, an ordinary ESO will still allow managers to attain a pot of option gold.\nSimilarly, investors view positively the issuance of very deep-out-the-money op-\ntions that require managers to dramatically raise the value of the company before\nthey can cash out. The weakest signal is provided by at-the-money options\u2014or\neven worse, in-the-money options\u2014that require little or no effort to become profit-\nable.\n\u2022 \nInformation asymmetry. An academic who believes in market efficiency would\nsay that there is no possible way for an investor to systematically outperform the\nmarket. This is because investors bid assets up and down to reflect all new infor-\nmation.\nHowever, even the most ardent efficient market theorist has to admit that executive\nstock options provide a loophole in this theory. This is because managers possess\nsignificant inside information, and often have it well before it is publicly released.\nAs executive stock options are almost always granted at-the-money, the exercise\nprice of an issued option generally reflects \u201cold\u201d information\u2014not the new inside\ninformation. If managers can influence the timing of their stock option grants, they\ncan receive \u201ccheap\u201d options without having to buy or sell publicly traded shares or\noptions. Since executive stock options are not generally disclosed until the com-\npany files a proxy\u2014approximately three months after the end of that fiscal year\u2014\nmanagers can theoretically exploit this \u201casymmetric information\u201d to earn an excess\nreturn.\nIn fact, Professor David Yermack of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Busi-\nness recently published a study that found that managers do just that. Professor\nYermack tested the hypothesis that \u201cCEOs ... receive stock option awards shortly\nin advance of favorable news that pushes company stock prices higher.\u201d As Figure\n2 shows, \u201cCompanies making stock option awards to their CEOs outperform the\nmarket on a risk-adjusted basis by slightly more than two percent during the period\nbeginning the day after the award and lasting approximately ten weeks.\u201d14\n"

By systematically using their influence to get \u201ccheap\u201d options,\nCEOs co-opt value from the shareholders for whom they ostensibly act as agents.\nThis also means that standard formulas for calculating the cost of executive stock\noptions\u2014which use the \u201cpre-good news\u201d share price as an important valuation\nparameter\u2014will understate the true cost of option grants.

Indeed, the SEC re-\nquires the calculation of share count dilution that would occur were employees to\nimmediately exercise all of their in-the-money options. Beyond this, most managers\nand investors believe that an increase in diluted earnings per share signifies an in-\ncrease in shareholder value.16\nHowever, the diluted EPS accounting calculation significantly distorts economic\nreality.17 Before we explain why this is so, we must first delve into how account-\nants treat employee stock options.\n2.

To be fair, the accountants do allow companies to assume that hypotheti-\ncal proceeds from employees exercising their options would be used to repurchase\nshares. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) are calculated by dividing net income by\nthe number of these diluted shares.19 For example, Microsoft\u2019s diluted EPS of\n$1.67 in fiscal 1998 was a full 9% below the company\u2019s basic EPS of $1.83.\nCritically, the accounting approach does not fully reflect economic reality. This\nis because the diluted share count calculation only reflects the dilution that re-\nsults from in-the-money stock options. However, options also have value from the\npossibility that the underlying stock\u2019s market price will rise higher than the exer-\ncise price before the option expires. Accountants ignore this \u201ctime value\u201d for\nboth in-the-money as well as out-of-the-money options. As most companies issue\nemployee stock options that have long lives, this approach significantly under-\nstates the value of outstanding and future options. Indeed, the high-tech compa-\nnies with the largest option packages often have the most volatile stock prices, and\nhence, the most valuable options (see Appendix A).\nIt is theoretically possible to refine this approach by properly incorporating the\ntime value of outstanding options into the adjustment of total shares outstanding\u2014\nthe denominator in the earnings per share calculation. However, we find this ap-\nproach to be counterintuitive. We believe the more intuitive economic approach is\nto view outstanding options as an off-balance sheet liability. Further, to account\nfor the cost of future option grants, we should adjust the numerator\u2014the firm\u2019s\nincome\u2014by subtracting the economic value of annual option grants to employ-\nees.\nMicrosoft is an example of a company that discloses useful information on its\nESOs. While Microsoft\u2019s SEC filings state that \u201cno compensation cost is recog-\nnized because the option exercise price is equal to the market price of the underly-\ning stock on the date of grant,\u201d the company does not stop there. On the contrary,\nMicrosoft does something we have not seen from any other company: it releases\n\u201csee-through\u201d pro forma income statements that indicate how much it thinks ESOs\nlower earnings. Specifically, the company subtracts the cost of its ESOs from re-\nported earnings\u2014as measured by the cost necessary to fully hedge the company\nagainst the share price appreciation related to its ESO program.\nWhile we have a different opinion on how to calculate the economic cost of a com-\npany\u2019s annual stock grants, we fully agree with the gist of Microsoft\u2019s approach.\nIndeed, Bill Gates\u2019 friend and fellow billionaire Warren Buffett concurs with this\nview. In his 1997 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter to Shareholders, Buffett\nsuggested: \u201c[A firm\u2019s] true [option] compensation cost ... [should be] brought out\nof the closet and charged ... against earnings.\u201d\nThe accountants at FASB tried to implement something akin to this approach in\ntheir earlier 1995 encyclical, SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensa-\ntion. In fact, they came very close to requiring that companies subtract the eco-\nnomic costs of employee stock options from net income. 20 However, Dennis\nBeresford, the chairman of the FASB, backed away from doing so because:\n"

It would destroy all American business and\nWestern civilization.\u201921\nWhile we understand that managers may be averse even to a small risk that their\nstock price could fall, we would note that academic research has repeatedly shown\nthat when cash and earnings diverge, the market follows cash. Thus, we believe\nthat the market has already taken the cost of the options into account. However,\nthis debate \u201cbecame so divisive that it threatened the Board\u2019s working relationship\nwith some of its constituents.\u201d Yielding somewhat, FASB made adoption of the\nstandard voluntary, mandating only that companies disclose the economic costs of\nemployee stock options in the footnotes of their SEC filings. SFAS 123 is still very\nuseful, however, as it discloses valuable information to investors.22\nHow Outstanding Options Affect Shareholder Value\nMany firms have substantial amounts of outstanding ESOs that exist from past\ngrants. Over time, the owners of these ESOs will convert their options into regular\nshares or allow them to expire worthless. At any point in time, however, these op-\ntions definitely have value. Indeed, we believe that the value of outstanding ESOs\nmust be viewed as an economic liability that has been incurred by the firm.\nThis logic rests on solid corporate finance. The economic value of a firm is the\npresent value of future cash flows. This economic value can be thought of as a pie.\nIn exchange for providing capital, the investors agree to share the wealth created\nby that firm\u2014that is, to slice the pie up\u2014according to certain rules.\nBondholders, by contractual agreement, get timely interest payments and a return\nof capital. In accordance with the established pecking order, bondholders get \u201cfirst\ndibs\u201d on any cash to be returned to investors.\nShareholders are a residual claimant on a firm\u2019s assets. That is, shareholders get\nwhatever is left of the pie after bondholders have gotten their prenegotiated fill. In\nan efficient market, the per-share value of a firm will be the amount of economic\nvalue that is left after debt takes its share, divided by the number of outstanding\nshares. While there is a risk that there will be no pie left, there is also the possibil-\nity of receiving a potentially huge pie.\nIn the context of this model, then, we believe that\u2014just like debt\u2014ESOs represent\nan economic liability that must be subtracted from the value of a firm to calculate\nshareholder value. This is because the value claimed by ESO owners comes from\nthe same source as the value claimed by ordinary shareholders: the possibility of\nthe firm increasing in value and creating a \u201chuge pie.\u201d23\nTo value the economic liability represented by Microsoft\u2019s outstanding ESOs, we\nuse the information provided in Microsoft\u2019s recent SEC filings as inputs into the\nstandard Black-Scholes option pricing model (see Appendix D for details on our\nmethodology). We also incorporate expected option cancellations from employee\ndefection, the dilution from option exercise, and the tax deductibility of ESOs upon\nexercise. Using this information, we estimate that employees who owned ESOs laid\nclaim to approximately $22 billion of value at the end of Microsoft\u2019s 1998 fiscal\nyear.

Put another way,\nthe present value of estimated future option grants over the 22 year CAP\u2014over-\nlooked in a traditional DCF model\u2014equals a staggering $53 billion. Combined\nwith the $22 billion in outstanding options, Microsoft\u2019s past and future options\nhave a present value of $75 billion. This is equivalent to 25% of Microsoft\u2019s total\nmarket capitalization of $304 billion.\n If At First You Don\u2019t Succeed, Try to Reprice!\nOne of the major reasons to grant ESOs is to give managers an incentive to create\nvalue and drive the stock price up. Unfortunately, this happy scenario does not\nalways unfold. If a company\u2019s stock price falls precipitously, an ESO that was\ngranted at-the-money may become deep out-of-the-money. At this point,\ncompanies often choose to \u201creprice\u201d or \u201creload\u201d the ESOs by lowering the exercise\nprice. This is also sometimes accompanied by an extension of the maturity of the\nlife of the option.\nNYU Stern Business School Professors Menachem Brenner, Rangarajan Sunda-\nram, and David Yermack recently studied this increasingly popular phenomenon.\nThey found that while only 0.7% of executives in the S&P ExecuComp database\nhad their options repriced in 1992, almost 2.0% of executives had their options\nrepriced in 1995 (see Figure 8). While this is the last year in which analysis has\nbeen completed, anecdotal evidence suggests that this number has increased since\nthen. More relevant, we expect to see a wave of repricings after the recent market\ncorrection, as we saw after the 1987 stock market crash.\nFigure 8\nIncreasing Frequency of Executive Stock Options\nannual frequency of stock option repricings for top managers covered by the S&P ExecuComp database, 1992\u201395\nNote: Sample comprised of compensation for executives from 1,500 firms, including those in the S&P 500, MidCap 400, and\nthe SmallCap 600 indices.\n 6.

Retain employees. The major concern is that the specter of worthless options\nwill prompt executives and talented employees to jump ship to a competitor. As\nNetscape\u2019s spokesperson said after the company repriced its ESOs for its non-\nexecutive employees in January 1998: \u201cWe did it because we\u2019d like to attract and\nretain employees.\u201d26\n2. Reduce agency costs. The board of directors may also worry that unless they\nreprice underwater stock options for their executives, formerly enthusiastic senior\nmanagers will abandon value-maximization and attempt instead to maximize their\nconsumption of perquisites and compensation. This reasoning is most defensible\nwhen done in reaction to a marketwide fall in equity prices, such as the wave of\nrepricings that followed the Crash of 1987.27\n3. Lower executive risk taking. An executive with deep-out-of-the-money stock\noptions will only become wealthy if the company\u2019s stock price increases spectacu-\nlarly. Thus, there is an incentive to pick highly risky projects, so as to increase the\nchance of hitting a jackpot. However, this would hurt bondholders, who abhor risk\nand just want to get their principal back. Thus, if a firm\u2019s stock is low because it is\nnear bankruptcy, creditors may apply pressure to reprice options to avoid \u201cexces-\nsive\u201d managerial risk taking.\nShareholders understand the economic justifications given for repricing ESOs to\nretain employees and reduce agency costs. After all, it\u2019s better to accept dilution of\nyour ownership of a valuable business than to own 100% of a company with no\nemployees.\nHowever, shareholders still have several valid objections to repricing:\n1. Employee\u2019s lack of exposure to downside. Employees who have their ESOs\nrepriced receive a benefit that shareholders do not. Virginia Tech Professors Don\nChance and Raman Kumar and Boston University Professor Todd recently pub-\nlished a study that shows that repricings of executive options follow approximately\none-year periods during which the average firm sees its shares lose one quarter of\nits value. Furthermore, on average, these repricings lower the exercise price by\napproximately 41%. This increases the economic value of the average executive\nstock option package by 16%.28\nIt is particularly frustrating to shareholders when executives\u2014not just employ-\nees\u2014get their options repriced. It does not seem fair to allow executives to \u201cdou-\nble-dip\u201d by receiving options that not only never have downside, but will always be\nadjusted so executives make money. Indeed, if executives can become wealthy\nwithout working, options lose their power to lower agency costs.\n2. \u201cInalienable Options\u201d are expensive. We can clearly calculate the increase in\noption value following a repricing. Using some fancy math, we can also calculate\nthe value of a \u201crepriceable\u201d option at grant date. If companies grant options that\ncan never expire worthless, those options have to be more valuable at grant date\nthan ordinary options without a similar \u201cphone call from the governor\u201d feature.\nProfessors Chance, Kumar, and Todd conservatively estimate that a \u201crepriceable\u201d\noption is 7% to 10% more valuable than a normal \u201cunrepriceable\u201d option.29 Using\n"

The\nsame study found that 45% of companies that repriced once did it at least once\nmore. One company even repriced six times. Thus, the estimate of a 7% to 10%\npremium\u2014the calculation assumes only one repricing\u2014may be too low.\n3. Perverted management incentives. Habitual repricing may cost shareholders\nmore than the value given to employees by the lowering of the ESOs\u2019 exercise\nprice. The real costs of habitual repricing may result from the perversion of man-\nagement incentives. Companies grant ESOs mainly to make sure that managers\ndeliver good shareholder returns. However, the very executives who made the\nstrategic or execution blunders that resulted in a lower share price end up benefit-\ning in a repricing. Thus, a cynical, yet savvy, manager has a real incentive to drive\nthe stock down, get his options reset, and then try to restore the company\u2019s for-\ntunes. So, while options by themselves should lower agency costs, options coupled\nwith habitual repricings may raise agency costs.\nIf shareholders had their way, repricing as an unadulterated practice would end.\nHowever, there are ways to mitigate the costs of repricing. For example, repricings\ntypically involve a one-for-one exchange of options with high exercise prices for\noptions with a low exercise price. Even if a company needs to reprice ESOs to\nkeep employees or reduce executive risk-taking, the board can lower the number of\nrepriced options issued to make the repricing value-neutral. A company can also\nlower the contractual life of the options or increase the number of years before the\noptions vest. Above all, investors would like any ESO modifications to be subject\nto shareholder approval.\nThese steps would go a long way toward removing the salt from investors\u2019\nwounds. This rapprochement might also help a stock recover from its lows. A\ncompany whose investors trust its managers to take shareholder-friendly actions\nmay see this trust reflected in a higher valuation.\nOption Repricings as a Signal\nOne interesting hypothesis is that even a shareholder-unfriendly option repricing\nrepresents a positive signal to the market. The idea is that a company\u2019s insiders\u2014\nwith the best knowledge of a company\u2019s prospects\u2014make the decision to reprice\nthe options. Thus, the timing of the repricing represents the best guess of the\n\u201csmart money\u201d as to when the stock\u2019s tailspin will end. Indeed, analysis of recent\nrepricings made by Professors Chance, Kumar, and Todd seems to support this\nhypothesis: option repricings seem to happen when a company\u2019s share price halts\nits free fall (see Figure 9 on the following page).\n"

Supporting\nthis, the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) earned on the average stock only\nrose 1.7% during the 250 days following a repricing. The positive signal associ-\nated with repricings may in fact exist in particular cases. However, the evidence\nindicates that, on average, investing in a stock when it reprices its ESOs will not\nlead to meaningful market outperformance.\nOption Repricing Accounting and the End of an Era?\nLenient accounting contributes to the widespread use of option repricings. A com-\npany can reprice by canceling its old out-of-the-money options and replacing them\nwith new at-the-money options and still get cosmetically favorable accounting\ntreatment. As with \u201cnormal\u201d options, current accounting regulations do not view\nthe new at-the-money option grants as an expense.30\nHowever, a proposed change in accounting regulations may spell the end to option\nrepricings. The FASB recently tentatively decided that an option repricing trans-\nforms an ordinary ESO from a so-called \u201cfixed option plan\u201d into a \u201cvariable plan.\u201d\nThis would subject a repriced ESO to the same accounting treatment as an indexed\nESO or an SAR\u2014that is, changes in the intrinsic value of vested repriced options\nwould have to be recorded as an expense (or, more rarely, a credit) to reported ac-\ncounting earnings. Given managers\u2019 aversion to lowering reported earnings, if this\nregulation is adopted, we would expect the repricing of options to become much\nless common.31\n"

For example, a call option on a stock gives its\nowner the right to buy a stock at a fixed price\u2014called an option\u2019s exercise or\nstrike price\u2014regardless of the stock\u2019s market price.

However, if the stock goes down a lot, the option\u2019s downside ex-\nposure is limited. This makes option owners prefer high volatility in the price of\nthe underlying stock, as it increases the chance that his option will be very valuable\nwithout exposing him to large losses.\nWe can represent this concept graphically as well. Scenario A of Figure 11 shows\nan option on a low volatility stock. This option has a narrow price distribution that\nclusters around the exercise price. In contrast, Scenario B shows a similar option\non a high volatility stock with a wide price distribution. By overlaying these price\ndistributions over a standard option payoff diagram, we can estimate the probabil-\nity that the underlying stocks will rise above the option\u2019s exercise price. The larger\nshaded area in Scenario B shows that the more volatile the stock, the higher the\nchance that the option will be profitable. All things equal, then, higher stock price\nvolatility translates into a higher time value.\n Figure 11\nA Call Option\u2019s Time Value Increases as Stock Price Volatility Increases\n Scenario A: Low Stock Price Volatility\nScenario B: High Stock Price Volatility\n \nPayoff to call\noption on firm\nX\u2019s shares\nPayoff to \noption on X\nExercise price\n(a)\nProbability\ndistribution of\nfuture price of\nfirm X\u2019s shares\nFirm X share price\nShaded area\nrepresents\ntime value\n \nPayoff to call\noption on firm\nY\u2019s shares\nPayoff to \noption on Y\nExercise price\n(b)\nFirm Y share price\nProbability\ndistribution of\nfuture price of\nfirm Y\u2019s shares\nShaded area\nrepresents\ntime value\nSource: Principles of Corporate Finance, Richard A.

Purchasing\nan option gives an investor the right to purchase a share at a fixed price in the fu-\nture. In essence, an option gives its owner an interest-free loan in the amount of the\nexercise price for the length of the option. The value of this loan increases with the\nlength of the option life and the risk-free rate. Thus, an option\u2019s value increases as\nthe risk-free rate increases.\n Before we finish our option primer, we should note two practical considerations\nthat will affect our valuation of employee stock options:\n\u2022 \nDividends. In an efficient market, the value of a stock is the present value of\nfuture cash dividends. When a stock pays a dividend, the stock owner will be as\nwell off as he was before the dividend was paid. However, after an investor re-\nceives cash-in-hand from a dividend payment, the stock\u2019s price will fall by pre-\ncisely that amount. Thus, while dividends may be an important part of total\nshareholder returns, it always lowers a stock\u2019s absolute price level. Accordingly,\nthe value of an option to buy that stock will also fall.\n Thus, when valuing an option with a short lifetime, we should lower the option\u2019s\nunderlying share price by the present value of dividends expected to be received\nover the option\u2019s life.33 When valuing options with a longer life, we should use\nRobert Merton\u2019s adaptation of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula that in-\ncorporates an estimate of a stock\u2019s long-term dividend yield (see Appendix B for\nmore information on how to adjust the Black-Scholes option pricing model for\ndividends).34\n\u2022 \nEuropean versus American options. These catchy titles refer to two flavors of\noptions. The European option can only be exercised on the last day of the option\u2019s\nlife, while the American option can be exercised on any day that the option exists.\nThe increased flexibility of American options makes them slightly more valuable\u2014\nalthough it makes them more mathematically difficult to value. Regardless, inves-\ntors often use the Black-Scholes model to value American calls as prematurely\nexercising an option involves forfeiting an often hefty time value.\n"

In part, these would-be\nNobel Prize winners were stymied by the lack of advanced mathematics in classi-\ncal economics training. Fortunately, we do not need to know how to derive the\nBlack-Scholes model in order to use it. Indeed, we do not even need to know the\nBlack-Scholes formula in order to understand what value drivers make options\nvaluable (see Appendix A).\n In this Appendix, we present the generalized Black-Scholes formula, leaving the\nderivation of the equation to option textbooks.35 We do this so readers can enter the\nformula into a spreadsheet in order to value options.

If a distinction is made, \u201cwarrants\u201d are typically described as having a\nlonger life than \u201coptions.\u201d This distinction is generally valid. However, options and\nwarrants differ in another important aspect that gives them different market values.\nThis difference can best be explained with a simple example. When an investor\npurchases an \u201coption\u201d on, say, a share of Intel from the Chicago Board Options\nExchange, it represents the temporary right to buy that stock at a certain fixed\nprice from someone who currently owns that existing share. If the investor decides\nto exercise the \u201coption,\u201d the amount of the fixed price will go to the owner of that\nshare of Intel, and ownership of that share will change hands. Note that this in no\nway changes either the value of Intel or number of Intel shares outstanding.\nA \u201cwarrant\u201d is subtly different. The investor who purchases a similar \u201cwarrant\u201d\nfrom a company obtains the temporary right to pay a fixed price to own a share\nthat does not currently exist. The difference is that, unlike an \u201coption,\u201d \u201cwarrants\u201d\nare issued not by an independent third party, but by the company itself. Thus, if\nthe investor exercises an Intel \u201cwarrant,\u201d the company itself receives the proceeds\nof the exercise price, and issues a new share in return. The exercise of a \u201cwarrant,\u201d\nthen, has two effects that the exercise of an \u201coption\u201d does not:\n1. It raises value the value of the company by the amount of the exercise price,\nand\n2. It lowers the value per share by increasing the number of outstanding shares.\nThe net effect of (1) and (2) will always result in a lower value for the \u201cwarrant\u201d\nthan for a similar \u201coption\u201d with the same terms and condition. Indeed, warrant ex-\nperts have derived a mathematical formula defining the relationship between a\n\u201cwarrant\u201d and its \u201coption equivalent\u201d:36\n\"\nEquivalent\nOption \n\" \nof\n \nValue\n  x \nshares\n  \nof\nNumber \n warrants\nof\nNumber \n \n 1\n1\n \n \nValue\nWarrant \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb+\n=\nAppendix C\nThe Difference\nbetween \u201cOptions\u201d\nand \u201cWarrants\u201d\n"

Thus, when valuing ESOs, we should calculate the\nvalue of its \u201coption equivalent,\u201d and then multiple it by the \u201cwarrant conversion\nfactor\u201d described in the equation above. Not doing so will result in an overstate-\nment of the ESO\u2019s value.\nCompanies such as Microsoft and Dell routinely sell so-called \u201cput warrants\u201d to\nthird parties, which provide a partial hedge against share price appreciation. In\nexchange for a premium for the sale of the put warrant\u2014which under current laws\nis tax-free corporate income\u2014the company assumes a liability. 37 Specifically, the\nowner of a put warrant can sell a share of stock back to the company at the war-\nrant\u2019s exercise price\u2014no matter how low the underlying stock\u2019s market price falls.\nIn this scenario, the company buys a share of stock from the owner of a put war-\nrant.

In order to perform this analysis, we need to estimate a number of\nparameters. This Appendix walks through this calculation, using Microsoft as a\ncase study.\nThe first step in this analysis is to value the ESOs using the Black-Scholes option\npricing method (see Appendix A and B for more information on this model). The\ncompany gives us detailed information on options in five \u201ctranches\u201d\u2014each with its\nown range of exercise prices. To calculate the Black-Scholes value, we must com-\nbine this information with our estimates of the following six parameters for each\ntranche:\n1. Stock price: Microsoft closed at 105 7/16 on October 27, 1998.\n2. Weighted average exercise price. The annual report and 10-K SEC filing give\nthis information for each tranche of outstanding options.\n3. Expected life of option. Microsoft reports the \u201cremaining life (in years)\u201d for\neach tranche of outstanding options. We use this number to value the company\u2019s\nESOs; using the usually shorter \u201cvesting period\u201d of options will result in under-\nstating the options value.\n4. Risk-free rate. The appropriate risk-free rate is the rate associated with the\nrisk-free zero-coupon security with the same maturity as the option. The preferra-\nble choice is to obtain this information from a data vendor such as Bloomberg for\neach tranche.38\nAnother common practice is to use the risk-free rate assumed by the company.\nWhile this may be an acceptable shortcut, it will tend to understate the value of\nESOs when rates drop or if the company picks a lower risk-free rate than is ap-\npropriate.\n5. Volatility (\u03c3). This parameter refers to the expected volatility\u2014technically, the\nstandard deviation\u2014of the underlying stock. Investors can use one of three ap-\nproaches to estimate this parameter.\n\u2022 First, the company discloses its own estimate of the volatility that it uses to\nvalue annual stock option grants. As with risk-free rates, companies have an in-\ncentive to choose a lower volatility level, so using a company\u2019s estimate may result\nin understating the value of outstanding options.\n\u2022 The second approach is to use the stock\u2019s historical volatility levels as a proxy\nfor expected volatility. A rule of thumb is to measure the volatility over the same\nnumber of historical days as the option\u2019s expected life. Thus, to estimate the vola-\ntility of a one-year option, use the historical volatility of the stock over the last\nyear.\n\u2022 The final approach is to impute the volatility embedded in a listed option with\nterms similar to that of the option that is being valued. This is accomplished by\nentering the market price of an option as an input into the Black-Scholes formula,\nalong with the four non-volatility inputs, and then imputing what the market ex-\npects the volatility to be. This is the most computation-intensive approach, but is\nlikely to provide the most accurate answer.\nAppendix D\n"

Note that this assumes that the company has a constant divi-\ndend yield over the option\u2019s life. Alternatively, this assumption can be relaxed by\nassuming the dividend yield is zero and lowering the stock price by the present\nvalue of future dividend payments expected during the life of the option.\nUsing these six inputs, we can calculate the value of each \u201ctranche\u201d of Microsoft\u2019s\nemployee stock options.\nTo illustrate this methodology, the remainder of this Appendix will focus on how\nto value Microsoft\u2019s most recently issued tranche of outstanding ESOs, with exer-\ncise prices between $59.61 and $87.25.\nThere are four main steps:\n1. Black-Scholes valuation. Microsoft\u2019s 10-K filing shows that the company had\napproximately 61 million of these ESOs outstanding. The company also discloses\nthe inputs it uses to calculate the Black-Scholes value of its annual option grants.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we have valued Microsoft\u2019s outstanding ESOs\nusing these same estimates (see Table 9).\nTable 9\nCharacteristics of Microsoft\u2019s ESOs with Exercise Prices between $59.61 and $87.25, FY98\nRange of \nExercise Prices\nWeighted \nAverage \nExercise Price\nExpected Life of \nOption\nRisk Free \nRate\nVolatility \n(\u03c3)\n\u03c3)\nDividend \nYield\nValue of Call \nOption \nEquivalent\n59.61 - 87.25\n64.00\n$               \n6.5\n                      \n5.7%\n32.0%\n0.0%\n65.58\n$               \nSource: SEC filings and CSFBC analysis.\nThe Black-Scholes formula tells us that a call option with these characteristics has\na value of $65.58. At first glance, it seems we should multiply this value times the\nnumber of outstanding warrants and have our answer. However, we must make a\nnumber of potentially major adjustments:\n2. Employees leaving before their options vest. Most firms use ESOs as a tool to\nretain valuable employees. Thus, options are typically structured so that an em-\nployee who leaves the firm has to forfeit any unvested options. While losing a\nvaluable employee does not help a company, shareholders do benefit in part from\nthis forfeiture. To value this effect, we estimate how long each option tranche has\nbefore it becomes fully vested. Then, using our estimate of how frequently employ-\nees leave the firm, we estimate how many of the ESOs in a particular tranche will\nexist at expiration date. We then multiply this number\u2014the expected number of\noptions at expiration date\u2014by the company\u2019s estimate of each option\u2019s Black-\nScholes value to get a preliminary estimate of those ESOs\u2019 value.\nWe applied this technique to our case study of Microsoft\u2019s ESOs with exercise\nprices between $59.61 and $87.25. These ESOs have an expected life of 6.5 years.\nOur next step is to estimate the vesting period of the typical Microsoft option.\n"

We would lean to-\nward the lower end of the range at five years since the text implies that the major-\nity of the options are of the kind that vest in 4 \u00bd years. Using this estimate, and\nassuming that most options expire in 10 years, only an option that has less than 5\nyears to expiration will be fully vested. Thus, we can infer that these options with\na 61/2 year contractual life have 11/2 years before they will be fully vested.\nThe next step is to estimate the number of options that Microsoft employees forfeit\nannually. Fortunately, Microsoft discloses the number of options outstanding,\nalong with annual option grants, cancellations, and exercises. Using this informa-\ntion, we can divide the number of options cancelled annually by the balance of op-\ntions at the beginning of the year to calculate what we call the \u201coption churn rate\u201d\n(see Table 11).\nTable 11\nEstimate of Microsoft\u2019s Annual \u201cOption Churn\u201d\nYear\nNumber of \nOptions\nAnnual \nCancellations\nOption Churn \nRate\nJune-94\n456\n18\n3.9%\nJune-95\n456\n14\n3.1%\nJune-96\n476\n18\n3.8%\nJune-97\n478\n13\n2.7%\nAverage\n3.4%\nSource: Company SEC filings and CSFBC analysis.\nWe can see that Microsoft employees typically forfeit between 2.7% and 3.9% of\ntotal outstanding options annually.

In\nthe absence of an \u201coption reload\u201d\u2014in which management cancels all options with\nexercise prices above a certain price and replaces them with options with a lower\nexercise price\u2014we can use this number as a proxy for the percentage of options\ncancelled annually.\nWe can then use this estimate to infer how many of these options will actually exist\nwhen they become fully vested.

This Ap-\npendix details the specific steps needed to perform this analysis. Continuing our\ncase study of Microsoft, this Appendix applies our methodology to value Micro-\nsoft\u2019s annual stock option grants. Because this analysis has many similarities to\nthe valuation of outstanding ESOs, it may be helpful to first read Appendix D.\n1. Black-Scholes valuation. SFAS 123 requires that every company calculate the\nBlack-Scholes per-option value of its annual stock option grants since 1995. It also\nrequires disclosure of the inputs into the Black-Scholes formula. As a good corpo-\nrate citizen, Microsoft also discloses this information. For example, in its 1998 10-\nK SEC filing, Microsoft states that its 1998 annual stock option grant had a\nBlack-Scholes per-option value of $23.62.\nAs with outstanding options, we can use disclosed information with several as-\nsumptions to calculate the Black-Scholes value of option grants (see Appendix B).\nBecause we are going along with Microsoft\u2019s assumptions here, we can accept the\ncompany\u2019s valuation of its annual stock option grants.\n2. Employees leaving before their options vest. In Appendix D, we estimated\nthat Microsoft employees tend to forfeit about 3.4% of outstanding options annu-\nally. Applying this churn rate to the number of ESOs granted annually, we can\nestimate how many options we expect will actually exist when they become fully\nvested. Using our estimate of a five-year vesting period and 10-year option life, we\nfollow the same method as outlined in Appendix D to arrive at the following esti-\nmates:\nTable 14\nMicrosoft\u2019s Estimated Number of ESOs Expected at Vesting Period End, 1995-98\nin millions\nYear\nNumber of \nOptions Granted\nEstimate of \nAnnual Employee \nChurn\nVesting \nPeriod of \nGranted \nOptions\nEstimated \nNumber of \nOptions at \nVesting Period \nEnd\n1998\n69\n                       \n3.4%\n5\n58\n                        \n1997\n110\n                     \n3.4%\n5\n92\n                        \n1996\n114\n                     \n3.4%\n5\n95\n                        \n1995\n88\n                       \n3.4%\n5\n74\n                        \nSource: SEC filings and CSFBC analysis.\n3.

Finally, we\nadjust this value for the tax deductibility of the ESO\u2019s intrinsic value at exercise.\nThis lowers the cost of the option to the company by the amount of the marginal\ntax rate.

This estimate depends on many fac-\ntors, such as changes in business fundamentals, trend analysis, and the scalability\nof a company\u2019s business model.\nTo estimate Microsoft\u2019s future annual ESO grants, we first analyzed the com-\npany\u2019s historical option cost as a percent of revenues\u2014including both revenues\nand changes in deferred revenues.

This Appendix explains the relevant U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) regulations on stock option taxation, and how those regu-\nlations affect shareholder value.39\nThe government takes the simplest approach possible to options: the IRS will take\nnote of an option as a taxable event only if it can be clearly valued. For example, if\nthe company grants an ESO with an intrinsic value below the price of the under-\nlying stock, the employee will have to recognize the difference as gross income to\nbe taxed at the ordinary tax rate. However, since most companies grant at-the-\nmoney ESOs, the IRS usually does not tax the option at all at the grant date, even\nwhen it has considerable economic value.\nThe IRS will then wait until an employee exercises an option before noting it as a\ntaxable event. Only then does the employee have to recognize the intrinsic value of\nthe option\u2014the difference between the market value of the underlying share and\nthe exercise price of the option\u2014as ordinary income.40\nThe IRS has a symmetrical policy toward employers: during the same year in\nwhich an employee recognizes ESO-related gross income, the employer can deduct\nthe same amount from its taxable income.41\nTable 18\nChronology of Taxable Events Related to Option Grant and Exercise\nESO Granted\nESO Exercised\nStock Sold\nEmployer\nDifference between market\nprice and ESO\u2019s exercise\nprice deducted from tax-\nable income in that year\nESO\u2019s intrinsic\nvalue deducted from\ntaxable income in\nthat year\nNothing\nhappens\nEmployee\nDifference between market\nprice and ESO\u2019s exercise\nprice added to gross in-\ncome in that year\nESO\u2019s intrinsic\nvalue added to gross\nincome in that year\nEmployee\npays normal\ncapital gains\ntax\nSource: Section 83 of the United States Internal Revenue Code.\nWe advocate that investor subtract the cost of an ESO\u2014as calculated by the\nBlack-Scholes method\u2014from net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT). It is im-\nportant, however, to account properly for the tax deductibility of the intrinsic value\nof the option upon exercise.\nThe question of the tax treatment of options can be answered by adopting the bi-\nnomial option pricing model, outlined by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in a classic\n1979 paper.42 This method demonstrates that the after-tax cost of an ESO to the\nissuing firm will equal the calculated Black-Scholes value times the quanity one\nminus the marginal tax rate.43 We have followed this approach through this paper.\nAppendix F\n"

Using the company\u2019s reported tax rate of 35%,\nwe can divide $1.553 billion by 0.35 to infer that employees exercised options with a cumulative intrinsic value of $4.437 billion\nin 1998. We then divide this amount by the number of Microsoft full-time employees\u201427,055 people on June 30, 1998\u2014to infer\nthe per employee value of ESOs.

Specifically, the interest expense from convertible bonds should be added back to net income when conversion\nof the bonds into common shares is assumed.\n20 To be specific, the company is allowed to amortize the after-tax cost of an ESO\u2014as valued by the Black-Scholes method\u2014over\nthe vesting period of the option.\n21 \u201cGretchen Morgenson, \u201cStock Options Are Not a Free Lunch,\u201d Fortune Magazine, 216.\n22 Even SFAS 123, however, does not mandate quarterly disclosures of the pro forma effects of option costs.\n"

A \u201cdown-and-out\u201d strike-step option is an option that terminates with no value upon the un-\nderlying stock hitting a value that is a certain percentage less than the exercise price. A \u201cdown-and-out\u201d strike-step option is an\noption that springs to life only if the underlying stock hits a value that is a certain percentage less than the exercise price.\n30 Financial Accounting Standards Board.
