      "text": "July 8, 2016  \n \nForm Follows Function \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nLouis Sullivan, a modernist American architect who lived in the late 19th and early 20th century, popularized the \nphrase \u201cform follows function.\u201d His point was that an architect should design a building to serve its intended \nfunction. The concept applies to organizations as well. A thoughtful leader carefully considers how his or her \nfirm seeks to add economic value and builds the organization to do so. Our focus is on investment \nmanagement companies. \n \nIn simple terms, an investment firm starts with data, which it seeks to refine into information. Analysts and \nportfolio managers then evaluate that information and identify securities that appear to be mispriced. \nMispricings are absolute when price differs from value and relative when two securities are mispriced \ncompared to one another. Portfolio managers then assemble securities in a portfolio. The goal is to generate \nattractive returns after considering risk. Organizations can do these tasks quantitatively, qualitatively, or \nthrough some blend of the two. See exhibit 1.  \n \nExhibit 1: Possible Sources of Edge in an Investment Process \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nThere are multiple sources of possible edge throughout the process. Firms can gain access to better data \nthan the competition or have means to refine that data into information that is superior to others. Other firms \nmay rely on analysis or portfolio management to squeeze out an advantage. Quantitative approaches provide \nrigor and consistency. Fundamental approaches can benefit from specialization and identify instances where \nthe rules-based approaches go wrong.   \n \nThere are related aspects such as time horizon. Some investment firms seek many little anomalies and trade \nfrequently to capitalize on them. Think Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies. Others take a long view \nwith a belief that large mispricings will evaporate over time. Think Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. \nBoth firms have been successful but have radically different organizational structures.  \n \nThe nature of the client base is also vital. Investors have a tendency to buy high and sell low, which means \nthat the dollar-weighted rates of return for most funds are well below the time-weighted rates of return.2 The \ntypes of clients an investment firm has and how they add or withdraw funds also has an influence on the \norganization and results of the firm. \n \nHere is the main point: You should align every aspect of your organization to support the source of edge you \nperceive. Form follows function.  \n \nThis is important because research shows that the organization is more important than the individuals within \nit.3 Klaas Baks, a professor of finance at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University, used a standard \neconomic model that considered managers and organizations as the factors of production and abnormal \nreturns as the output. He studied more than 2,000 equity mutual funds and concluded that the organization \nexplains about 70 percent of the difference between fund results and that the manager was only 30 percent.4 \nWhile the relative contribution of the manager and the organization depends on your assumptions, the \nmanager\u2019s contribution is less than half in nearly all situations.  \nData \nInformation\nSecurity\nSelection\nPortfolio\nConstruction\n"

      "text": "July 8, 2016  \n \nForm Follows Function \n3 \nFurther supporting this argument is evidence that the performance of investment professionals drops off \nsharply when they switch firms.5 One of the main reasons for this performance degradation is that \nprofessionals leave behind \u201cfirm specific human capital\u201d\u2014essentially a set of resources, methods, culture, \ninformal networks, and talented co-workers\u2014that supports and augments their own capabilities. \nNotwithstanding the evidence of the importance of the organization, 85 percent of analysts that researchers \ninterviewed believed that their performance on the job was independent of their employers and hence \nconsidered their skills to be portable. \n \nAcademics have looked carefully at organizational structure and have concluded that it is important in \ndetermining both strategy and performance.6 One dimension researchers studied was hierarchy, defined as \n\u201cthe distinct number of layers of the structure of the fund.\u201d For example, a fund with a chief executive officer, \na chief investment officer, a head of fixed income, a portfolio manager, and analysts would have five layers. \nThe research shows that each additional layer an investment firm has reduces average performance. \n \nThe rest of this report draws on research to highlight various aspects of organizational structure. We discuss \nthe role of team size in success in managing portfolios, how team composition affects performance, the \ndifference in performance between funds run by analysts and portfolio managers within the same firm, and \nwhich sources of input are most useful to portfolio managers. The goal is to prompt an assessment of your \nown organization. Where do you create value? Are there changes you can make to align your structure with \nyour objectives more effectively? \n \nPortfolio Management Team Size \n \nThe shift from single- to team-managed equity mutual funds is one of the biggest changes in the money \nmanagement business in the U.S. in the last quarter century. Exhibit 2 shows that about 70 percent of equity mutual \nfunds had a single manager in the early 1990s and that teams manage close to three-quarters of funds today. \nFurther, the members are anonymous in about 20 percent of funds run by teams.7 \n \nFrom the point of view of a fund company, having a single manager run a fund has pros and cons. The pros are that \nit is easier to market a fund with a superstar manager, and indeed the inflows for named managers exceed those of \nfunds run anonymously. Single managers may also have a greater incentive to perform than a member of a team \nbecause he or she is personally accountable for the fund\u2019s results. Further, funds run by one individual have higher \nfees.8 The cons are that single managers seek to capture more of the fund\u2019s economics and take on more risk than \nteam-managed funds do.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Evidence from Mutual Fund Databases,\u201d Journal of Financial and Quantitative \nAnalysis, Forthcoming, 2016. \n \nAs they examined the data more closely, Patel and Sarkissian realized that only the teams in large \nmetropolitan areas outperformed the single managers.12 The idea is that larger cities have higher employee \nskills and productivity than smaller ones, which create favorable conditions for team results.13 So it is not \nsimply a team that makes a difference. It is a team that has the requisite characteristics. \n \nThe work by Patel and Sarkissian prompts an assessment of the structure of portfolio management teams for \ninvestment firms that rely on a fundamental approach to security selection. Prior research of portfolio manager \nresults shows that those who attended more selective colleges or universities generated better returns.14 While \nthe era of the single-managed fund has been fading for decades, only recent work shows that teams deliver \nbetter results than individuals do under certain conditions, as well as which team size is most effective. We \nnow turn to the topic of how to construct a team to get the highest probability of success. \n \nTeam Composition \n \nGroups are effective at making decisions when the views of team members are diverse and there is a \nmechanism to aggregate those views.15 Diverse teams have the potential to add value when the members \nhave different information, the information and models of the members are relevant to the problem at hand, \nand there is sufficient communication.16 Promoting diversity within an organization and managing it effectively \nare separate tasks. As leading researchers have noted, \u201cTo implement policies and practices that increase \nthe diversity of the workforce without understanding how diverse individuals can come together to form \neffective teams is irresponsible.\u201d17 \n \nOrganizational theorists who study diversity distinguish between social category diversity, which is often what \norganizations consider when they assess the issue, and informational diversity.18 Social category diversity \nincludes differences in gender, age, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation.

Neale, \u201cWhy Differences Make a Difference: A Field Study of Diversity, Conflict, and \nPerformance in Workgroups,\u201d Administrative Science Quarterly, Vol. 44, No 4, December 1999, 741-763.

The role of social category diversity is less clear. Social category diversity \nadds value when it is a proxy for informational diversity and when group communication is effective. However, \nif social category diversity leads to diminished group communication and members fail to reveal their unshared \ninformation, team performance suffers.   \n    \nResearchers used this framework to test the impact of each type of diversity on the results for teams that \nmanage U.S. equity mutual funds.19 Because they could measure neither type of diversity readily, they \ndeveloped proxies for each. The researchers used gender and age as proxies for social category diversity and \neducation level and industry tenure as proxies for informational diversity (see Exhibit 4).  \n \nThey applied these measures to 2,260 teams from 1996 to 2003. Investment teams are a good test ground \nfor diversity because the task is clear, there are a large number of decisions that go into managing a portfolio, \nand the environment is consistent. They found that informational diversity has a positive influence on \nperformance and that social category diversity has a modestly negative influence. The drag of social category \ndiversity is the result of gender diversity, as age diversity had no significant impact. The researchers found, for \nexample, that a single-gender team would outperform a team consisting of three males and one female by \n122 basis points per year.  \n \nGender diversity\u2019s negative impact on portfolio results requires some additional discussion. To begin, it is \nimportant to recognize that globally only 15 percent of portfolio managers are women, with a high of 32 \npercent in Asia to a low of 11 percent in Latin America.20 The diversity research shows that being a token \nwithin a group, for example one woman among men or one man among women, tends to be \ncounterproductive.21  \n \nStudies of a large number of mutual and hedge funds show no difference in average performance but that \nmen generally have a higher standard deviation of results than women do and are more overconfident.22  \n \nGender diversity likely fails to add value for a couple of reasons. The first is that women remain \nunderrepresented in portfolio management and hence face the challenge of critical mass. Second, research \nshows that there remains bias against women.23 For instance, women-run funds have lower inflows than their \nmale counterparts, fail at a higher rate because of an inability to raise funds, and receive less media attention. \nSocial category\nVariables: Gender\nAge\nRace\nEthnicity\nReligion\nSexual orientation\nProxies:\nGender\nAge\nInformational\nVariables: Education\nExperience\nFunctional knowledge\nExpertise\nTraining\nAbilities\nProxies:\nEducation (degree level)\nIndustry tenure\n"

      "text": "July 8, 2016  \n \nForm Follows Function \n7 \nThis discussion underscores the point that promoting diversity in the workplace without instructing employees \nhow to manage it properly ultimately does a disservice to all. There is nothing magical about a team. You must \nassemble it properly, in terms of both size and composition, and manage it effectively to derive the benefits.  \n \nAnalyst-Run Funds within Fund Families \n \nIn most investment management firms that rely on fundamental analysis, analysts evaluate securities and \nrecommend that portfolio managers buy or sell them. Portfolio managers, in turn, generally share in the \nanalysis and create portfolios in an effort to deliver excess returns. Analysts are mostly responsible for security \nselection, or finding edge. Portfolio managers are mostly responsible for portfolio construction, or figuring out \nhow best to capitalize on that edge.   \n \nThe first question is whether buy-side analysts have demonstrated skill. Some studies show that analysts \ncontribute to excess returns for portfolios and others suggest they do not.24 Much of this research is based on \nthe data from a single global asset manager. \n \nGjergji Cici and Claire Rosenfeld, professors of finance, took a novel approach to assess the skill of buy-side \nanalysts.25 They looked at results for 68 nontraditional funds run exclusively by analysts (roughly half, we \nestimate, are Fidelity Select funds) at 14 mutual fund families over a decade. This approach allowed them to \nexamine actual investment decisions of buy-side analysts rather than just their recommendations. \n \nCici and Rosenfeld found that the funds run by the analysts delivered higher returns than funds with similar \ncharacteristics run by portfolio managers in the same firm. They labeled a portfolio manager in the same firm \nas an \u201caffiliated manager.\u201d Exhibit 5 summarizes their finding. They also found that the analyst-run funds \noutperformed comparable unaffiliated managers.  \n \nExhibit 5: Performance of Analyst-Run versus Portfolio Manager-Run Funds \n \nSource: Gjergji Cici and Claire Rosenfeld, \u201cA Study of Analyst-Run Mutual Funds: The Abilities and Roles of Buy-Side Analysts,\u201d Journal of Empirical \nFinance, Vol. 36, March 2016, 8-29. \n \nWhat is going on? First, the researchers showed that some mutual fund families have more skilled analysts \nthan others, leading to better results for the funds run by both analysts and portfolio managers. Second, they \nfound that portfolio managers who rely on analyst ideas do better than those who do not. It turns out that how \nmuch portfolio managers use analyst recommendations is a function of tenure.

While it is plausible to assume that the \nmore seasoned managers add value through their experience, the data suggest that they would be better off \nsticking to the recommendations of the analysts.  \n \nAnalyst funds are also smaller on average than manager funds and have lower expense ratios. These factors \nalso contribute to relative performance. \n \nOne element that Cici and Rosenfeld do not emphasize but is worthy of consideration is portfolio construction. \nAnalyst-run funds are usually sector neutral. Hence, they rely almost exclusively on stock selection for excess \nreturns. By contrast, manager-run funds commonly have sector tilts. Disaggregating security selection and \nportfolio construction in performance attribution is particularly important.  \n \nTo Whom Should Portfolio Managers Listen?   \n \nPortfolio managers get information from their internal analysts as well as external analysts. Sell-side research, \nwhile shrinking, remains a big business. For example, the global budget for sell-side equity research was $8.2 \nbillion in 2007 and is expected to be 40 percent of that amount in 2017.26 How do portfolio managers \nbalance recommendations from the inside and outside? \n \nResearchers examined this question and found that portfolio managers place an average weight of over 70 \npercent on buy-side analysts, less than 25 percent on sell-side analysts, and less than 5 percent on \nindependent research.27 The study considered the decisions of portfolio managers of more than 1,000 funds \nover a 3-year span. There is evidence that mutual fund trades follow sell-side recommendations to some \ndegree and that those recommendations are informative.28  \n \nPortfolio managers rely more on their own analysts as the average number of sell-side analysts following a \nstock declines, the average error in sell-side forecasts for a company expands, and as the standard deviation \nof sell-side analyst estimates rises. \n \nWhen asked about how they use the sell-side analysts, buy-side professionals suggest that they value \nexperience following a company, which includes deep industry knowledge and frequent communication with \nmanagement.29 However, buy-side analysts generally have a longer time horizon than those on the sell-side. \nMore than 80 percent of buy-side analysts said their time horizon was longer than one year, and a quarter of \nthem suggested it was beyond three years. Most sell-side recommendations use one-year target prices.  \n \nThe reliance on internal versus external sources is relevant to the discussion about form and function. An \ninvestment firm that can secure external sources for data or information that add value and are cost effective \nrequires fewer resources internally. That said, leaders of investment firms must constantly monitor the trade-\noffs between in-house and external input into the investment process.  \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is a challenge for active money managers to generate excess returns. Central to developing the skill to do so \nis a process that identifies and exploits market mispricings. There are many possible ways of finding edge, \nfrom the short-term signal that Renaissance Technologies gathers to the long-term value that Berkshire \nHathaway seeks. But in all cases, it is essential to align your resources\u2014people, process, and capital\u2014to \nserve your source of edge. In other words, consider how you intend to achieve your objective and consider \nhow to organize your firm to do so most effectively.  \n"
