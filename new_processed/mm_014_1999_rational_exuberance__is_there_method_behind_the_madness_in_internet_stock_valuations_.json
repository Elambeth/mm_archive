      "text": "Rational Exuberance?\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nIntroduction\nThe valuations accorded some Internet-related technology companies are gener-\nating a broad range of reactions, from bewilderment and bemusement to disbelief\nand disgust. Most value investors are appalled, and many growth investors find\nthemselves without calibration benchmarks. What is going on?\nWe are convinced that some recent Internet high fliers will fall back to earth. But\nfundamentally, we sense that greater forces are at work here than most people\nappreciate, and that these forces are not well understood by the average investor\nor media pundit.\nThe goal of this report is not to defend valuations in the marketplace. Rather, it is\nto offer some counterweight to the argument that current market values are com-\npletely unfounded. Indeed, we believe that some of the key value drivers in tech-\nnology are not obvious and are, in some cases, counterintuitive.\nInvestment ideas\nWe highlight four central investment themes\u2014business models, the network ef-\nfect, first-to-scale advantages, and real options\u2014in our attempt to account for\ncurrent valuations. We worked on these ideas with our Internet/New Media ana-\nlyst, Lise Buyer, who has used many of them in her analysis. Further we note that\nthere is an investment strategy, based on portfolio theory, that makes sense to\nus. The ideas are as follows:\nBusiness Models\u2014A business model explains how a company generates its\neconomic returns. While there are many approaches to creating value, under-\nstanding any business model requires appreciation of both the income statement\nand balance sheet. We believe that the financial community\u2014with its predomi-\nnately income statement-centric view\u2014is missing the power of some Internet\nbusiness models.\nThe best way to illustrate this point is to turn to some standard finance theory.\nThe value of any business is the present value of its stream of future free cash\nflows. Free cash flow, in turn, can be defined as the difference between cash\nearnings\u2014derived from the income statement\u2014and the investment in future\ngrowth\u2014derived from the balance sheet. Investment in future growth typically\nincorporates changes in net working capital and growth in fixed capital.\nGenerally, earnings represent an inflow of cash, and investment in future growth\nrepresents an outflow of cash. Still, free cash flow is the all-important sum be-\ncause it represents the pool of cash available for distribution to all the claimhold-\ners of the business.\nAs an exemplar of the New Economy, Internet companies have business models\nthat highlight the risk of looking only at the income statement. There are two spe-\ncific elements to note. First, the \u201cinvestment\u201d outflow is very often modest for New\nEconomy companies because their primary source of competitive advantage is\nintellectual capital, not physical capital. More to the point, an investor should be\nwilling to pay more for earnings of a New Economy company that has modest\ncapital needs than for the earnings of an Old Economy business that requires lots\nof capital, all things being equal.\nSecond, a number of companies are realizing cash inflows from their \u201cinvest-\nments,\u201d or balance sheet changes. This is because fixed capital requirements are\nnegligible and there is a favorable \u201ccash conversion cycle.\u201d For example, if a\ncustomer purchases a book from Amazon.com, the company will charge the\nbuyer\u2019s credit card almost immediately. Furthermore, Amazon.com maintains only\ntwo weeks of inventory. At the same time, AMZN takes about 45 days to pay its\nsuppliers. The result is that Amazon.com gets its cash roughly 30 days before it\n"

This means that as the business grows, it actually generates\ncash from working capital.\nSo some New Economy companies have turned the model on its head: their cash\nearnings (losses) are an outflow, but their investment in future growth is an inflow.\nOther companies\u2014such as Dell Computer\u2014are realizing double benefits by gen-\nerating cash both from operations and from the balance sheet. If Old Economy\ninvestors, accustomed to relying on earnings, are ignoring an important source of\ncash\u2014and cash flow drives market value\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that these investors\nperceive New Economy companies to be expensive.\nYahoo!\u2014the leading Internet portal\u2014offers another fascinating case study. In\nFigure 1, we charted YHOO\u2019s financial performance in what we call a \u201ccash eco-\nnomics matrix.\u201d Over the past two years, Yahoo! has migrated from being a mod-\nest negative free cash flow generator, for which both cash earnings and\ninvestments were cash outflows, to becoming a super cash flow generator,\nwhose cash earnings and investments are both cash inflows. Said differently, the\nearnings improvement at YHOO\u2014while dramatic\u2014actually belies the strength of\nthe positive cash flow swing.\nFigure 1\nCash Economics Matrix\nYahoo!, Inc.\n(60.0)\n(35.0)\n(10.0)\n15.0\n40.0\n(60)\n(30)\n-\n30\n60\nInvestment\nNOPAT\nOutflow\nOutflow\nInflow\nInflow\nQ4 96\nQ4 97\nNegative\nFree Cash Flow\nPositive\nFree Cash Flow\nQ4 98\nSource: Company SEC filings and CSFB estimates.\nAnother example contrasts the capital needs of Amazon.com versus its main\ncompetitor in the book business, Barnes & Noble. Table 1 shows that AMZN es-\nsentially invested no net operating cash in its business to achieve a $1 billion\nrevenue run rate (which the company achieved in fourth quarter 1998). Using\nBarnes & Noble\u2019s operating statistics, one can estimate that a traditional \u201cbricks-\nand-mortar\u201d retailer would have to invest more than $400 million to support the\nsame $1 billion run rate.\n"

Those onlookers that refuse to look beyond the income statement are\nmissing the substance of the model. It is true that Amazon.com\u2019s market value\nanticipates earnings in the not-too-distant future, but it is starting with a better\neconomic proposition than its more familiar competitors.\nNetwork Effect\n1\u2014Positive feedback\u2014the strong get stronger and the weak get\nweaker\u2014has always existed. However, the source of positive feedback is funda-\nmentally different, and inherently more powerful, in the New Economy than in the\nOld Economy.\nIn the Old Economy, positive feedback stems from economies of scale: the larg-\nest companies sustain the lowest unit costs. Importantly, economies of scale are\ndriven by the \u201csupply side,\u201d and consequently, run into natural limitations. In other\nwords, positive feedback wanes at a point well below market dominance.\nPositive feedback in the New Economy generally is driven from network eco-\nnomics\u2014often called simply \u201cthe network effect.\u201d The fundamental principle is\nthat a network becomes more valuable to each user as incremental users are\nadded. More specifically, the value of the network grows exponentially as the\nnumber of members grows arithmetically.\nA simple example underscores this point.\n2 Assume that a company sells goods to\n10 customers a day. If a new customer is added, sales rise 10%. Assuming that\nfixed costs can be spread, earnings might grow slightly faster but the relationship\nis basically linear.\nNow assume, say, this company is an online auction site with a network of 10\ncustomers that sells goods to each other every day (10\n2, or 100 interactions). Add\na new customer, and the interactions grow by 21% (11\n2, or 121 interactions).\nIn contrast to the Old Economy, the network effect is based on the \u201cdemand\nside.\u201d This is key because positive feedback does not dissipate when the market\ngrows. More users translate into more value, thus attracting more users, and so\non. This creates a virtuous cycle (see Figure 2).\n1\nMany of these ideas come directly from Information Rules, by Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian (Harvard Business School Press,\n1999), pp. 173-225.\n2\nThis example was inspired by Kevin Kelly of Wired magazine.\n"

Varian.\nThe main point is that a network of users is very valuable, and becomes more so\nas it grows over time. As companies start to enjoy the virtuous cycle, their reve-\nnue growth often meaningfully outstrips their cost increases. Further, the in-\ncreasing utility of the growing network locks in the customer base, enhancing the\nsustainability of excess returns. These phenomena in part explain the market\u2019s\nenthusiasm for businesses like America Online, Yahoo!, and, of course,\nMicrosoft.\nFirst-to-Scale Advantages\u2014First-to-scale advantages describe those compa-\nnies that establish user bases large enough to launch them into the virtuous cy-\ncle. The best metric of success, then, is often the size of the amassed network. In\nfact, it often makes sense for companies to forego current profits in an effort to\nbuild their network of users.\nBeing first in a given space is important, as it offers the opportunity to establish a\nbrand, set industry standards, and increase switching costs. However, an indus-\ntry\u2019s first mover is not always the first to scale, for a couple of reasons. To start,\nsome early entrants do not appreciate the importance of building a customer\nbase, and thus, do not leverage the virtuous cycle. Prodigy and CompuServe are\nexamples in the on-line services market.\nSecond, large incumbents in adjoining businesses are often able to \u201clink-and-\nleverage\u201d their established franchises into a new market once it becomes clear\nthe new market is viable. Microsoft\u2019s foray into the Internet browser market pio-\nneered by Netscape is a case in point.\nIn financial terms, first-to-scale businesses often enjoy meaningful valuation pre-\nmiums versus their competitors. User bases are important. Accordingly, valuation\nmetrics based on users may be a reasonable proxy for value creation.\nReal Options\u2014Real options analysis extends financial option theory to options\non real, or nonfinancial, assets. A financial option gives its owner the right\u2014but\nnot the obligation\u2014to purchase or sell a security at a given price. Analogously, a\ncompany that owns a real option has the right\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to make a\npotentially value-accretive investment to enter a new market. For example, Ama-\nzon\u2019s e-commerce expertise and customer franchise in the book market gave it a\n\u201creal option\u201d to invest in the e-commerce markets for music, movies, and gift.\nOther examples include growth options\u2014options to pursue follow-on projects as-\n"

One interesting\u2014\nand somewhat counterintuitive\u2014aspect of real options is that the greater the un-\ncertainty surrounding the development of the Internet, the more valuable these\noptions may be.\nLet\u2019s step back. Standard finance theory says that the greater the uncertainty, the\nhigher the appropriate discount rate, and the lower the present value. Uncer-\ntainty, expressed as volatility, lowers value. Most analysts tend to use relatively\nhigh discount rates to calculate the present value of Internet companies.\nBased on the widely used Black-Scholes model, option value is a function of the\nvalue of the underlying asset, a strike price, time, the risk-free rate, and volatility.\nAs options have asymmetric payoff schemes, volatility increases value. So an\nInternet company with lots of real options will be much more valuable than a\nstandard discounted cash flow analysis would suggest.\nWe believe it is reasonable to think of Internet companies as a combination of\ncurrent, known businesses, and a portfolio of real options. The question then be-\ncomes: which companies have the most options and what are they worth? Market\nsignals analysis\u2014reading from stock prices what expectations are imbedded in\nshares\u2014can be helpful in this appraisal.\nThe Gorilla Game\u2014Even if these ideas are given full weight, considerable risk\nobviously remains in investing in the Internet sector. How does an investor par-\nticipate intelligently?\nWe liked the idea espoused in the book The Gorilla Game\n3, which is based on\nportfolio theory. The authors advocate buying the stocks of all companies that\nhave a chance of dominating a given sector. Then, as it becomes apparent that a\ncompany will not dominate, positions should be sold with the proceeds rede-\nployed into the \u201cgorilla.\u201d In many technology sectors, positive feedback creates a\nwinner-take-all profit outcome. Hence, the valuation of the gorilla, while appar-\nently expensive, may become even richer as the company extends its lead over\nits less-fortunate peers.\nConclusion\nThese are heady times in Internet investing. Only time will tell if the market\u2019s exu-\nberance for many of these stocks is warranted. Our goal is not to suggest that the\nbasics of finance and strategy are no longer valid. Rather, it is to make the case\nthat the strategy and finance models driving current valuations are not widely un-\nderstood or recognized.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager\nor co-manager of a public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies\nmentioned.
