Pricing a company generally means \nassigning a multiple to a measure of current or prospective \nearnings or cash flows, and that multiple can vary based on the \nmarket\u2019s mood and the prevailing story about the business. \nValuing a company involves estimating the present value of future \nfree cash flows and requires study of the firm\u2019s fundamentals. \nDamodaran argues that most investors spend their time pricing \nrather than valuing businesses.1 \nSurveys of equity analysts support this view.2 Researchers \ncollected responses from nearly 2,000 analysts who were \nmembers of the CFA Institute, a global association of investment \nprofessionals. Asked about their approach to valuation, nearly 93 \npercent selected \u201ca market multiples approach.\u201d  \nWhen questioned about which market multiple they used, 88 \npercent of the analysts said price-earnings (P/E). Seventy-seven \npercent replied that they use a multiple with enterprise value in the \nnumerator, and by far the most popular of those was the \nenterprise value-earnings before interest taxes depreciation and \namortization (EV/EBITDA) multiple. The use of P/Es and \nEV/EBITDAs is not mutually exclusive, of course, and most equity \nanalysts use various methods to price a stock. \nSeventy-nine percent of equity analysts indicated that they also \nuse a \u201cpresent discounted value approach,\u201d and the discounted \nfree cash flow model (DCF) was the most common method. This \nappears to be an encouraging departure from pricing stocks, but \nit turns out it is routine for a substantial amount of the model\u2019s \nvalue, commonly in excess of 75 percent, to be in the continuing \nvalue.3 The continuing value reflects the cash flows beyond the \nexplicit forecast period. Analysts often calculate it using either a \nformula reflecting growth in perpetuity (generally free cash \nflow/[cost of capital \u2013 growth]) or an EV/EBITDA multiple.4 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

It is common for the growth in perpetuity to \nassume a growth rate that is too high.5 And when the preponderance of value comes from an EV/EBITDA \nmultiple, the result is multiples analysis dressed up as a DCF model.      \nThis report discusses four topics. The first is what multiples miss and why they are becoming less informative \nthan they were in the past. Second is an examination of why the two most popular multiples that equity analysts \nuse, P/E and EV/EBITDA, can provide different signals about a stock\u2019s relative attractiveness. Third is a look at \nthe alternative measures of earnings and EBITDA that companies report to see if they add insight. Finally, we \nfocus on EV/EBITDA multiples and link them back to fundamental drivers of value.   \nWhat Multiples Miss \nA multiple in any form is a shorthand for the process of valuation. Shorthands are useful because they can save \nus time. A multiple attempts to compress information about the essential assumptions of a proper DCF model \ninto a single figure. This is a tall order.  \nThe numerator of the multiples that analysts use most frequently is the current price of the equity (P of P/E) or \nthe enterprise value of the firm (EV of EV/EBITDA). These sums seek to capture the present value of the relevant \ncash flows for the life of the business. Stock prices generally reflect company cash flows that extend decades \ninto the future. \nThe denominator is earnings (E of P/E) or cash flow (EBITDA of EV/EBITDA) that the company has recently \nearned or is expected to earn in the near future. Right away we see that we are comparing a numerator that \nrepresents the long term with a denominator that considers only the short term. \nThe central determinants of corporate value include the level and sustainability of return on invested capital \n(ROIC), growth, and risk. Companies create value when their investments earn a return in excess of the \nopportunity cost of capital. Higher growth generates higher value for firms that earn a return above the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC). Higher growth leads to lower value for a given negative spread. And growth \nhas no impact on value for a company that earns its cost of capital.     \nMultiples provide no direct insight into the magnitude of a firm\u2019s investments or whether they will generate a \nsufficient return. This is the main consideration that multiples miss.        \nBut there is more to this insight because the ability of multiples to capture the underlying economics of a business \nhas degraded over time. This is mainly the result of a shift in how companies invest. In prior generations, \nbusinesses invested primarily in tangible assets such as factories and machines. These investments were \nrecorded on the balance sheet and expensed on the income statement through depreciation.  \nToday, the majority of investments are in intangible assets, including customer acquisition costs and branding. \nBut companies commonly expense these investments on the income statement as they incur them. Accountants \nrecord these investments as selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) \nexpenses. This reduces current earnings. \nThe \u201cmatching principle\u201d is an important concept in accounting. The idea is that a company should match \nexpenses to the related revenue. Cost of goods sold (COGS), SG&A, and R&D are the three main categories \nof expenses that accountants subtract from revenue to calculate earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).  \n"

All rights reserved. \n6546868 Exp. 4/30/2025 \n3\n \n \nAnup Srivastava, a professor of accounting at Haskayne School of Business at the University of Calgary, studied \nhow well COGS and SG&A (including R&D) adhere to the matching principle. He sorted U.S. public companies \ninto cohorts based on the decade they were listed, from the 1960s to the 2010s.6 Firms that listed in the last 30 \nyears make up more than 80 percent of the total number of public companies today. \nSrivastava found that COGS match revenues effectively and consistently for all of the cohorts. But while SG&A \nmatches revenues well for the early cohorts, it is \u201cpractically unmatched to revenues\u201d for companies that went \npublic from the 1990s on.  \nMultiples are supposed to reflect the magnitude and return on investment. But the shift to intangible investments, \nand how companies record them in financial statements, has wreaked havoc on that ability.7 To illustrate this \npoint, we take two looks at the financial results of Microsoft, a multinational technology company that invests \nheavily in intangible assets. The first is what the company reports and the second is what the figures look like \nafter we capitalize, and amortize, the firm\u2019s intangible investments.8  \nFor fiscal 2023, Microsoft reported net income of $72.4 billion. Adjusted for intangible investment, the figure \nwould be $83.0 billion, or 14.7 percent higher.9 The company\u2019s EBITDA was $102.4 billion before the adjustment \nand $147.0 billion, 43.6 percent more, after the adjustment. Based on figures from June 30, 2023, the end of the \ncompany\u2019s fiscal year, the trailing P/E went from 34.9 as reported to 30.5 as adjusted, and EV/EBITDA went \nfrom 24.2 to 16.9. These are material differences.   \nAcademics and practitioners use multiples because of the evidence that high multiples often precede below-\naverage returns in the long run.10 That used to be true because the price reflected expectations for future value \ncreation and growth that was too rosy, resulting in a lofty multiple relative to the near-term profit outlook. But the \nrise of intangibles means that both earnings and invested capital are understated, weakening the signal that \nearnings and multiples formerly provided.11  \nNone of this suggests investors should ignore multiples altogether. Indeed, there may be some value in \ncombining multiples.12 But the main point is that multiples are getting worse at reflecting the economic picture \nthey are supposed to capture. A blind deference to multiples without understanding their limitations can severely \nhamper the effectiveness of an investment process. \nP/E and EV/EBITDA are the most popular multiples equity investors use. What do you do if two companies have \na similar P/E but a different EV/EBITDA multiple? Or a dissimilar P/E and the same EV/EBITDA? Understanding \nhow and why these calculations differ helps us bring to light their relative strengths and weaknesses. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6546868 Exp. 4/30/2025 \n4\n \n \nWhy Am I Getting Different Signals? \nNot surprisingly, the correlation between P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples is high (see exhibit 1). But there are \ncases where two companies are close on one metric and far apart on the other. We highlight a handful of those \npairs in the exhibit. \nExhibit 1: P/E and EV/EBITDA Multiples for the S&P 500, March 2024 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: As of March 5, 2024. Based on FactSet consensus estimates for next 12 months for EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS; \nExcludes financials and real estate; Trimmed P/Es at 1st and 99th percentiles; Axes truncated for visualization purposes. \nThese multiples are comparing different quantities. The P/E captures the relationship between the company\u2019s \nequity market capitalization and its earnings, or net income. P and E are commonly expressed per share. \nThe P/E is a levered ratio because it is measured after financing costs, and it therefore links the market value of \nequity to the earnings attributable to shareholders.  \nThe EV/EBITDA multiple compares the firm\u2019s enterprise value to EBITDA. Enterprise value equals the equity \nmarket capitalization (including preferred stock) plus debt and other liabilities, minus cash. The multiple is \nunlevered because it solves for enterprise value. EBITDA does not subtract financing costs or taxes. EBITDA is \nearnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) plus depreciation and amortization of acquired intangibles (DA).  \nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash charges. \nThe P/E is almost always higher than the EV/EBITDA for a profitable company. To see why, pretend that the \ncompany you are studying has no debt or excess cash, so that P equals EV. E is going to be lower than EBITDA \nbecause it is after taxes and does not add back non-cash charges. Since the numerator is the same and the \ndenominator is lower, the P/E multiple will be higher than the EV/EBITDA multiple. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nEV/EBITDA Multiple\nP/E Multiple\nr = 0.89\nWalgreens\nConagra\nAmazon\nDeere\nTyson\nTarget\nSouthwest\nDarden\nTeledyne\nWalmart\nApple\n"

Again, assume that P equals EV. You \ncan imagine that a company has negative earnings and positive EBITDA. In this case, the multiple of P/E would \nbe negative and the multiple of EV/EBITDA would be positive. \nThis discussion points to the reasons that P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples differ (see exhibit 2). We can organize \nthat analysis by going down the income statement. The first reason relates to the mix of tangible and intangible \ninvestment. As we saw, COGS tend to match revenues for all companies. COGS are the majority of total \nexpenses for tangible-intensive firms. SG&A is much more prominent for intangible-intensive firms.  \nFor instance, the total expense for Nucor Corporation, a steel company, was 94 percent in COGS and 6 percent \nin SG&A for 2023. For Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company, COGS were about 30 percent of expenses and \nSG&A the other 70 percent. Revenue minus total expense equals EBIT. \nThe way to get a consistent picture is to capitalize and amortize intangible investments as we did with the \nMicrosoft example. The important point is that the earnings and EBITDA will increase very little for tangible-\nintensive businesses and increase a lot for intangible-intensive companies.13 \nExhibit 2: Factors That Contribute to Differences in P/E and EV/EBITDA Multiples \nWhat \nWhy \nHow \nMethod of investment \n \n \n    Tangible \nHigher depreciation lowers net \nearnings but has no effect on EBITDA \nPhysical capital-intensive businesses have \na high ratio of depreciation to operating \nincome \n    Intangible \nHigh SG&A expense that reflects \ninternal intangible investment \nLowers EBIT, earnings, and EBITDA \nrelative to tangible intensive business \nCapital structure \n \n \n    Leverage \nInterest expense reflected in P/E but \nnot in EV/EBITDA \nIncreasing debt to equity results in: \n- Higher P/E when unlevered P/E is greater \nthan 1/cost of debt \n- Lower P/E when unlevered P/E is less \nthan 1/cost of debt \n    Cash holdings \nInterest income reflected in P/E but not \nin EV/EBITDA \nCan increase or decrease P/E ratio \nNon-operating expenses \nReduce earnings but have no effect on \nEBITDA \nIncrease P/E relative to EV/EBITDA \nTax rate \nTaxes reduce net income but have no \neffect on EBITDA \nA higher rate increases P/E relative to \nEV/EBITDA \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nNote that capitalization of intangible investments does not affect free cash flow. Multiples have lost relevance \nbecause of the widening gulf between earnings and what they are trying to reflect.     \nThe second reason these multiples diverge is because of differences in capital structure, the combination of \ndebt and equity a company uses to finance its growth.14 Debt has an explicit cost in the form of interest expense. \nEquity has an implicit cost that financial statements do not capture. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6546868 Exp. 4/30/2025 \n6\n \n \nThe impact of changes in capital structure on multiples is complex, but we can begin with some straightforward \nobservations. Start with a company that is financed solely with equity and has no excess cash. Now introduce \ndebt.  \nThe \u201cP\u201d of P/E will be unaffected since it reflects the value of the equity only. But the \u201cE\u201d will go down by the \namount of interest expense (net of the savings on tax).15 So the same P and a lower E means that the P/E \nmultiple goes up, all else being equal. \nAdding debt increases \u201cEV,\u201d which is mostly equity plus debt, and has no effect on EBITDA, which is by definition \nbefore interest expense and taxes. A higher EV and the same EBITDA means that the EV/EBITDA multiple also \ngoes up, all things being equal. \nTheory suggests an optimal capital structure, in which a company has just the right amount of debt to maximize \nthe value of the tax shield less the cost of potential financial distress. The vast majority of companies do not \nmake the optimal capital structure their target.  \nThe pecking order theory of capital structure says that to fund their growth, companies start with cash generated \ninternally, then go to debt, and finally go to equity.16 Businesses with high ROICs often have sufficient cash flow \nfrom operations to finance their growth. Businesses with low ROICs commonly generate insufficient cash flow \nto fund the business and therefore need to issue debt or equity. \nIndustries with high ROICs tend to have lower debt-to-total capital ratios and those with low ROICs have higher \nratios (see exhibit 3). Further, companies with low ROICs tend to have \u201cDA\u201d that is a higher percentage of \nEBITDA than companies with high ROICs. This means that the gap between the P/E to EV/EBITDA multiple is \ngenerally greater for low ROIC companies with lots of debt than for high ROIC companies with little debt.   \nExhibit 3: ROIC and Debt-to-Total Capital for U.S. Industries \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: As of January 2024. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nDebt-to-Total Capital (Percent)\nReturn on Invested Capital\n"

These include costs associated with restructuring programs, asset write-downs or write-offs, \nreorganizations, and unrealized capital gains or losses. Companies nearly always report results excluding non-\noperating expenses.  \nA final reason P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples can differ is because of tax rates. Earnings are calculated after \npaying taxes, so earnings rise as the tax rate falls. EBITDA excludes taxes by definition so differences in tax \nrates do not affect EBITDA.  \nExhibit 4 provides an illustration of how these factors can contribute to a gap between P/E and EV/EBITDA. \nColumn A considers a business with no invested capital, debt, or taxes.

Invested capital creates an expense for depreciation and amortization (DA). This reduces \nearnings but has no affect on EBITDA. As a result, the P/E goes up to 25.0 but the EV/EBITDA stays at 15.0. \nColumn C assumes the company has debt but does not pay taxes. The financing costs reduce earnings. But we \nassume that the EV remains the same, so the value of the equity goes down as well. Still, the P/E multiple rises \nto 28.6 and the EV/EBITDA multiple is unchanged.   \nNext we assume the company pays taxes but has no debt (column D). This lowers earnings further but has no \nimpact on EBITDA, making the P/E double that of EV/EBITDA. \nColumn E on the far right assumes debt and taxes. This results in the largest difference between the P/E at 34.3 \nand the EV/EBITDA of 15.0. \nThis example is simplified and makes a number of unrealistic assumptions. For example, we determine the EV \nby taking a multiple of sales. The ratio of EV to sales would likely change based on the level of profitability \n(higher profits mean a higher multiple), as the result of the introduction of debt (tax shield), and because of taxes \n(government claim on cash flows). \nFurther, all of the inputs fall on a continuum. For instance, debt-to-total capital ratios and tax rates can range \nfrom low, or even negative, to very high. But the exhibit reveals how and why P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples can \ndiverge. \nWe can look at a pair of companies to make this point concrete. As of early March 2024, Walmart Inc. and Apple \nInc. had similar P/E multiples but different EV/EBITDA multiples (see exhibit 1). Walmart is a multinational retailer \nand Apple is a multinational technology company. The P/E multiple, based on earnings estimated for the next \ntwelve months, was 25.5 for Walmart and 25.4 for Apple. The EV/EBITDA multiple was 13.3 for Walmart and \n20.1 for Apple. The ratio of P/E to EV/EBITDA was 1.9 times for Walmart and 1.3 times for Apple. \nWe can point to three main reasons that Walmart had a bigger gap between its P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples \nthan Apple did. First, Walmart starts with a much lower starting EV/EBITDA because it is less profitable than \nApple, based on EBIT margins and ROIC. Second, Walmart has net debt whereas Apple has net cash. The cost \nof debt lowers Walmart\u2019s earnings and increases its P/E. Finally, Walmart has a tax rate that is 10 percentage \npoints higher than that of Apple. This also lowers its earnings and increases its P/E.  \nSaid differently, Walmart has characteristics (modest ROIC, debt, and average tax rate) that would roughly place \nit in the right column of exhibit 4 and explain the large gap between P/E and EV/EBITDA. Apple has \ncharacteristics (very high ROIC, no debt, a low tax rate) that make it look more like the second column in the \nexhibit justifying a small gap between P/E and EV/EBITDA. \n \n \n \n \n"

Most are non-operating, including currency, pension, and investment gains and losses. Others, \nsuch as stock-based compensation and net interest, are related to the ongoing operations. Adding back \namortization of acquired intangibles is defensible because companies expense the investment to maintain the \nvalue of the intangible assets.19  \nCompanies also adjust their GAAP earnings to remove the effect of non-recurring items, such as restructuring \ncharges, acquisition adjustments, extraordinary legal costs, and asset write-downs and write-offs.

They found that the average number of non-core items \nthat companies report has risen from 6 to 8 in recent decades and represented about 20 percent of net income. \nAfter stripping away non-core items, the resulting core earnings were more stable than the reported net income.  \nOn balance, the academic research suggests that non-GAAP results provide the market with information that is \nuseful.23 But investors should always be on the lookout for companies that take these adjustments too far.24 One \nexample is adding back stock-based compensation, which we and many others consider a legitimate expense.25  \nA Deeper Look at EV/EBITDA Multiples \nIf you are pricing a stock using an EV/EBITDA multiple, you should care how much of EBITDA is EBIT and how \nmuch is DA. The reason is that DA is a proxy for the maintenance capital expenditures a company requires to \nsustain its business.26 That means that for two firms with the same EBITDA, the one with higher EBIT will have \nmore cash flow to distribute to its claimholders and hence a higher value.  \nExhibit 6 shows the median EBIT and DA as a percentage of EBITDA by sector. EBIT makes up 75 percent of \nEBITDA for the consumer discretionary sector and 56 percent for utilities. The ratio of EBITDA to EBIT is called \nthe \u201cdepreciation factor.\u201d27 The depreciation factor is 1.3 for consumer discretionary (1.3 = 100/75), 1.8 for utilities \n(1.8 = 100/56), and 1.4 for the universe overall. The amount of depreciation and amortization a company \nrecognizes is a function of its capital intensity, the asset lives it assumes, and its acquisitiveness.  \nExhibit 6: EBIT and DA as a Percentage of EBITDA by Sector, 2023 \n  \nPercentage of EBITDA \nSector \nEBIT \nDA \nConsumer Discretionary \n75 \n25 \nConsumer Staples \n75 \n25 \nInformation Technology \n74 \n26 \nIndustrials \n73 \n27 \nHealth Care \n71 \n29 \nMaterials \n68 \n32 \nEnergy \n67 \n33 \nCommunication Services \n60 \n40 \nUtilities \n56 \n44 \nUniverse \n70 \n30 \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global.  \nNote: Russell 3000 Index as of 2/23/24; Medians for latest fiscal year; Universe excludes financial and real estate sectors \nand companies with zero or negative EBIT. \nDepreciation factors provide a sense of the spread between ROIC and WACC for a company.

All rights reserved. \n6546868 Exp. 4/30/2025 \n12\n \n \nThe spike in the middle of exhibit 8 is the result of a change in accounting rules for business combinations. Until \n2001, companies could use one of two accounting methods, either \u201cpooling of interests\u201d or \u201cpurchase,\u201d to record \na deal. The pooling-of-interests method allowed companies to simply combine their balance sheets and thus \nthere was no need to record intangible assets. The purchase method required companies to reflect goodwill and \nto amortize it over a period of up to 40 years.  \nIn 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised the rules so that companies could no longer \nuse the pooling-of-interests method. At the same time, the FASB removed the need for companies to amortize \ngoodwill. The sharp drop in amortization in 2002 reflects that accounting change.  \nThe FASB introduced another change in 2007 that clarified what companies could categorize as intangible \nversus goodwill assets. As a result, intangible assets increased relative to goodwill assets. The rise in \namortization as a percentage of DA from 13 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2023 reflects these accounting \nchanges as well as the overall increase in investments in intangible assets. \nThere is some evidence that EV/EBITDA multiples outperform other multiples, including P/E. Specifically, buying \nstocks with low EV/EBITDA multiples generates higher excess returns than other metrics.30 That said, the \nefficacy of P/E and EV/EBITDA can vary by industry.31 \nExhibit 9 shows the warranted EV/EBITDA multiples, considering various combinations of growth rates and \nROICs, for businesses with depreciation factors of 1.2, 1.4, or 1.6. We assume a debt-to-total capital ratio of 20 \npercent and a cost of capital of 7.6 percent in all cases.32 \nWhy companies with the same growth, ROIC, and cost of capital would have different EV/EBITDA multiples may \nnot be evident at first glance. The corporate values are in fact the same for the identical assumptions. The key \nis the difference in depreciation factors.  \nThink of it this way. Firms with low depreciation factors deliver the same EBIT with lower EBITDA than companies \nwith high depreciation factors. \nHere is an illustration to solidify the idea. If you assume a tax rate of 20 percent, a company has to earn EBIT of \n$125 to generate $100 in net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT). This holds for all EBITDA depreciation factors. \nFor a company with a factor of 1.2, depreciation and amortization is $25, and EBITDA is $150 ($150/$125 = 1.2).  \nFor a company with a factor of 1.6, depreciation and amortization is $75, and EBITDA is $200 ($200/$125 = 1.6).  \nBoth companies, assuming the return on incremental invested capital is equal to the cost of capital, have an \nidentical value of $1,315.8 ($100/.076). But the EBITDA multiple is 8.8 ($1,316/150 = 8.8) for the firm with a \nfactor of 1.2 and 6.6 ($1,316/200 = 6.6) for the firm with a factor of 1.6. \nThe exhibit also reinforces the lesson that growth increases multiples when returns are above the cost of capital \nand decreases multiples when returns are below the cost of capital. Firms that focus largely on EBITDA growth \nand fail to consider return on incremental invested capital can find themselves in financial difficulty.33  \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6546868 Exp. 4/30/2025 \n16\n \n \nAppendix: From the Gordon Growth Model to Multiples \nOne of the simplest valuation techniques is the Gordon growth model, named after Myron Gordon, an economist, \nwho formalized the approach in the late 1950s.36 \nThe model says: \nValue   \n= \n \nValue is the enterprise value (EV) of the firm, which equals the equity market capitalization plus debt and other \nliabilities, minus cash. \nFree cash flow (FCF) is the cash a firm generates that is free to be distributed to the holders of debt and equity. \nFormally, it equals net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus investments (I) in future growth. These \ninvestments include changes in working capital and capital expenditures (typically expressed net of \ndepreciation).37 \nThe cost of capital is the opportunity cost of capital providers. Investors and executives need to calculate the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) for companies financed with both debt and equity. Growth captures \nthe expected increase in FCF over time.  \nWe will show how to translate the value from the Gordon growth model into multiples, including EV/EBITDA, \nP/E, and EV/Sales.38 Much of this analysis follows Aswath Damodaran\u2019s exposition on the topic.39      \nWe start by decomposing FCF as follows: \nFCF  \n=  \nEBIT(1 \u2013 t) \u2013 (capital expenditures \u2013 depreciation) \u2013 \u0394 in working capital \nEBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and t stands for tax rate. The first term on the right side of \nthe equation is NOPAT and the second two terms are investments. \nWe can rewrite the equation to include EBITDA: \nFCF  \n=  \n(EBITDA \u2013 depreciation)(1 \u2013 t) \u2013 (capital expenditures \u2013 depreciation) \u2013 \u0394 in working capital  \n \n=  \nEBITDA(1 \u2013 t) + depreciation(t) \u2013 capital expenditures \u2013 \u0394 in working capital  \nWe can substitute free cash flow with these terms to calculate value: \n \nValue   \n= \n \n \nWe divide both sides of the equation by EBITDA in order to calculate the EV/EBITDA multiple (warning, this is \na little messy, but we will use some numbers shortly to make it clearer): \n \n \nBefore we proceed with the other multiples, let us take a moment to apply figures to show how it works. We \nassume the company has no debt, but introducing debt is straightforward. \nFree cash flow \nCost of capital \u2013 growth \nEBITDA(1 \u2013 t) + depreciation(t) \u2013 capital expenditures \u2013 \u0394 in working capital \nWACC \u2013 growth \nEV \nEBITDA = \nDepreciation(t)/EBITDA \nWACC \u2013 g       \n1 \u2013 t \nWACC \u2013 g \ncapital expenditures/EBITDA \nWACC \u2013 g       \n\u0394 in working capital/EBITDA \nWACC \u2013 g \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n"

Here is the reasoning. Depreciation is correctly considered an operating expense because it reflects \nwear and tear on physical assets. For instance, a company that buys a machine with a useful life of five years \nwill record it in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) on its balance sheet and depreciate the asset on the \nincome statement over its life. Amortization of acquired intangibles reflects different accounting. Assume a \ncompany acquires a customer list. The company would post the list as an intangible asset on the balance sheet \nand amortize it over its estimated useful life. But the money it spends to maintain and grow the list is expensed \non the income statement. \n20 Dirk E. Black, Theodore E. Christensen, Jack T. Ciesielski, and Benjamin C.
