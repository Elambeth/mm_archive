      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2015 \n \nUnderstanding Skill \n2 \nGood morning. It\u2019s a real pleasure for me to join you today, as these roundtable sessions always prompt me to \norganize my thoughts on an important and topical theme. This morning\u2019s topic\u2014understanding skill\u2014is near \nand dear to my heart since I wrote a book about skill and luck!1 But it\u2019s also a trickier topic than most people \nthink, and it has some counterintuitive aspects.  \n \nI will break my comments into three parts: \n \uf402\n First, I want to discuss what I call the \u201cparadox of skill.\u201d When we think of investing, most of us think \nthere\u2019s a dearth of skill. But, in fact, the problem is the exact opposite: there is too much skill. \n  \uf402\n Second, I\u2019ll discuss some qualitative ways to think about where excess returns may come from. These \nare broader ideas but may still be a useful way to frame investment decisions. \n \uf402\n Finally, I\u2019ll touch on some more quantitative ways to think about identifying skill. Well, I\u2019ll try to lay out a \nframework for doing so and then apply an idea or two to the framework. \n \nI. Let me start at the top and discuss what I call the paradox of skill. Now, I want to be clear that it\u2019s not my \nidea, but I did give it that name. The paradox of skill says that in many activities where both skill and luck \ncontribute to outcomes, it\u2019s often the case that as skill increases, luck becomes more important in shaping \nresults. More skill leads to more luck? That doesn\u2019t make sense on the surface.  \n \nI learned about this idea from the famous Harvard biologist, Stephen Jay Gould, who liked to write about \nevolutionary theory and baseball. One of my favorite pieces is about Ted Williams, the last player in Major \nLeague Baseball to hit over .400 for a full season\u2014he hit .406 in the 1941 season. Gould wrote about \nWilliams in his book, Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin.2 Gould asked why no player \nhas been able to replicate this feat. A few have come close, including Tony Gwynn, who hit .394  in 1994, \nand George Brett, who hit .390 in 1980.3  \n \nTo understand the answer, you have to think about two dimensions of skill: absolute and relative.4 Let\u2019s start \nwith absolute skill. I think it\u2019d be fair to say that in baseball, as in other professional sports, the level of \nabsolute skill has never been higher. You can attribute that to larger populations who can participate\u2014most \nprofessional leagues are truly international\u2014as well as better training, better coaching, and better nutrition. \nPut a contemporary ballplayer in the past and he\u2019d clean up. This is also true for business and investing.  \n \nThe problem is that this absolute improvement is obscured by the fact that there are interactions. Pitchers and \nhitters get better roughly in lockstep. It\u2019s an arms war\u2014and that pun is intended. And if one side gets too far \nahead, the powers that be at Major League Baseball change the rules to level the playing field. So, even as \nthe averages look about the same from year to year, the underlying skill to achieve those averages is markedly \nhigher today than it was in the past. \n \nThe second dimension of skill is the crucial one, and that\u2019s relative skill. Perhaps you can imagine the skill of \nplayers falling along a bell-shaped distribution. The point is that the bell is getting skinnier in a lot of domains, \nwhich means that the difference between the very best and the average participant is less today than it was a \ngeneration or two before. A fancier way of saying this is that the standard deviation of skill has declined over \ntime. If you accept that a player\u2019s batting average combines both skill and luck, as the standard deviation of \nskill shrinks, the standard deviation of batting average should follow\u2014even if you assume the distribution of \nluck stays the same. \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2015 \n \nUnderstanding Skill \n3 \nThat is indeed what we have witnessed. The standard deviation of batting average was .0326 in the 1940s \nand .0274 in the first decade of this century (see Exhibit 1). Saying this differently, Ted Williams was a four \nstandard deviation event in 1941. To be a four standard deviation event in 2011\u2014exactly 70 years later\u2014a \nplayer would have to hit 0.380. Now 0.380 is obviously awesome, and would easily win the batting crown \n(Jose Altuv\u00e9 won it in 2014 hitting .341). But it doesn\u2019t get you over the magic .400 level. And I should add \nthis is not limited to batting average. It applies to other relevant statistics, such as earned run average for \npitchers.5   \n \nExhibit 1: Decline in Standard Deviation of Batting Average \n \nSource: Michael J. Mauboussin, The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing (Boston, MA: Harvard Business \nReview Press, 2012), 55; Credit Suisse. \n \nHopefully, it\u2019s not too hard to see the relevance in investing. Certainly, skill has never been higher. Investors \ntoday have access to vast quantities of information and powerful computers, and are better trained than ever \nbefore. An investor today, put back into the 1960s with today\u2019s tools at his or her disposal, could run circles \naround the competition. But, of course, that skill is obscured by the fact that every investor competes with the \nmarket, which embeds information from lots of investors. \n \nThe relative skill of investors has declined over the decades. One way we can measure that is through the \nstandard deviation of excess returns. Imagine, again, a bell-shaped distribution. The standard deviation for \nactive mutual funds was about 12 percent in the 1960s and just 3.6 percent last year. The trend, after a brief \nspike around the dot-com era, has been steadily down. Just as in baseball, the difference between the best \nand the average has dwindled over time (see Exhibit 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060\n1870s\n1880s\n1890s\n1900s\n1910s\n1920s\n1930s\n1940s\n1950s\n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\nCoefficient of Variation\nStandard Deviation\nStandard Deviation\nCoefficient of Variation\n"

For some market participants to generate excess returns, other investors \nhave to lose an equivalent amount because the sum of positive and negative excess returns must be zero. A \nlow standard deviation says that there are not a lot of winners or losers. So, picking winners is hard. \n \nLet me emphasize that the problem in investing is not a lack of skill, it is the exact opposite: there\u2019s too much \nskill. But the discussion also places the emphasis\u2014properly\u2014on the distribution of skill. And that has gotten \nnarrower virtually everywhere we look.  \n \nII. Let me now turn to the second issue I\u2019d like to address, and that\u2019s some qualitative ways to think about \nwhere you might get excess returns. \n \nJim Rutt is the former CEO of Network Solutions\u2014which was sold in March 2000 right at the peak of the \nNASDAQ\u2014and preceded me as chairman of the board at the Santa Fe Institute. He told a great story.  \n \nWhen he was young, he played a lot of poker. Now this was before the recent poker craze, so it was much \nless mainstream. Jim honed his skills by day, learning the probabilities for various hands and studying common \npoker tells. Then he found games at night. He said he became pretty good and started playing with better \ncompetition. He won some and lost some, but on balance he made money.  \n \nAt that point, an uncle pulled him aside and offered some advice: \u201cJim, I wouldn\u2019t spend my time getting \nbetter; I\u2019d spend my time finding weaker games.\u201d In other words, instead of finding players who are as skilled \nas you are, you want to find players who are not as good as you are and who are rich. That way, you have a \nbetter chance of walking out of the room each night with cash stuffed in your pockets. \nNumber of funds 69\n142\n187\n120\n311\n562\n1,328\n1,070\n979\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n1967\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1978\n1981\n1984\n1987\n1989\n1992\n1995\n1998\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2011\n2014\nStandard Deviation of Excess Returns\n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2015 \n \nUnderstanding Skill \n5 \nLet me see if I can make this lesson more relevant for investing. One way to do this is to consider the \n\u201cfundamental law of active management,\u201d described by Richard Grinold more than 25 years ago.6 The fancy \nversion says that the information ratio equals the information coefficient times the square root of breadth.  \n \nIn plain language, it says that excess returns equal skill times opportunity. So, to make money, in poker or \ninvesting, you need skill but you also need opportunity. And that was what Jim\u2019s uncle taught him: Sometimes \nthe key to making money is not getting smarter. It\u2019s finding games where you\u2019re the smartest player. \nSpeaking of poker, Warren Buffett has a great saying: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don't \nknow who the patsy is, you\u2019re the patsy.\u201d7   \n \nSo how do you find games where you have an edge in relative skill? It\u2019s a complex answer, but let me focus \non three areas in public markets: \n \uf402\n Institutions versus individuals.8 This is similar to a professional poker player competing with an \namateur. Research shows that institutions tend to come out on top in these situations. Let me give you a \ncouple of examples. Institutions tend to fare better than individuals in initial public offerings. In other \nwords, the institutions are better at discerning which deals are fluffy. Institutions are often more \nsophisticated and hence make fewer mistakes than mom and pop investors. One study of the Taiwanese \nmarket showed that institutions had positive alpha and individuals had negative alpha over the same \nperiod. So, in effect, the institutions were winning at the expense of individuals. \n \uf402\n Taking advantage of people who need to buy or sell for non-fundamental reasons.9 A classic \nand persistent example of this is spin-offs. Spin-offs are often small and debt-laden businesses that large \nmutual funds have no interest in owning. So, they basically jettison them indiscriminately. This creates an \nopportunity for excess returns for those willing to scoop them up. Another example is the unwinding of \nthe leverage cycle, where holders have to sell assets to meet margin requirements. Again, they don\u2019t \nhave the luxury to be price sensitive, creating opportunity. \n \uf402\n Diversity breakdowns.10 Markets tend to be efficient in a classic sense when certain conditions prevail, \nincluding diversity of the investor base. When investors correlate their behavior, we can see big moves up \nor down and a resulting departure between fundamentals and expectations. Any time you hear concern \nabout a \u201ccrowded trade,\u201d you are hearing about a potential diversity breakdown. Obviously, the dot-com \nboom is an extraordinary example.  \n \nBut the very factor that causes market inefficiency\u2014correlated beliefs\u2014makes exploiting that inefficiency \ndifficult. The desire to be part of the crowd is powerful, and being apart from the crowd is scary for most. \n \nIf you observe the behavior of investors\u2014institutions as well as individuals\u2014they tend to want to do today \nwhat they should have done two years ago. The key is to keep your eyes on the future and to think about \nwhere inefficiencies may exist. \n \nDavid Swensen, the chief investment officer of Yale University\u2019s endowment, uses the dispersion of active \nmanagers as a proxy for market efficiency. He measures the dispersion by examining the difference between \nthe first and third quartile results in various asset classes (see report cover). The idea is to index where the \nopportunities are modest and to seek skill where they are abundant.11  \n \nHe told his students, \u201cYou want to spend your time and energy pursuing the most inefficiently priced asset \nclasses because there\u2019s an enormous reward for identifying the top quartile venture capitalist and almost no \nreward for being the top quartile of the high-quality bond universe.\u201d12 \n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2015 \n \nUnderstanding Skill \n6 \nNow, one area that is of interest to me that is getting some more attention is whether the rise in passive \ninvesting is itself creating opportunity for active managers.13 We do know, for example, that the trading \ncharacteristics for stocks change after they have been added to an index such as the S&P 500. But it remains \nto be seen whether indexing itself becomes a source of edge for active managers. \n \nIII. Let me now wrap up with a more quantitative approach to thinking about skill. Whether it\u2019s sports, \nbusiness, or investing, we\u2019d all like to come up with statistics that are indicative of a good process and hence \ngive us a good chance of achieving attractive outcomes over time.   \n \nWhat makes for a useful statistic?14 Well, you generally want two characteristics. The first is that it is \npersistent\u2014or what statisticians call \u201creliable.\u201d That means the outcome correlates highly with itself over time. \nHigh persistence is generally indicative of skill.  \n \nThe second characteristic is that it is predictive. In other words, it correlates highly with what you are trying to \nachieve. Statisticians call this \u201cvalidity.\u201d So, you want a statistic that is persistent and predictive. \n \nLet me go back to the world of baseball for a moment to make this point more concrete. One of the statistics \nfeatured in Michael Lewis\u2019s book, Moneyball, was on-base plus slugging (OPS) percentage.15 The Oakland \nA\u2019s thought that was a better statistic than batting average. Well, let\u2019s run it through our test. First, it turns out \nthat OPS is more persistent than batting average. Second, it also has a higher correlation with run production.  \nSo it is a better statistic\u2014and, of course, the A\u2019s thought it was undervalued in the market.16 \n \nExhibit 3: OPS Is a Better Statistic Than Batting Average \n \nSource: Michael J. Mauboussin, The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing (Boston, MA: Harvard Business \nReview Press, 2012), 141; Baseball Prospectus. \n \nUnfortunately, we have no similar measures in the investing world that are super clean. There is one I\u2019ll \nmention because it has made a bit of a splash in recent years, although it remains controversial. And that is \nactive share.17 \nPersistent\nBA\nHigh\nSkill\nLuck\nLow\nPredictive\nOPS\nBatting average\nOn-base plus \nslugging percentage\n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2015 \n \nUnderstanding Skill \n7 \nI suspect most of you have heard of active share, but let me offer a brief definition so that we\u2019re all on the \nsame page. Active share is the percentage of a fund\u2019s portfolio that is different from the fund\u2019s benchmark \nindex. So, a fund with a zero active share is an index fund, and a fund with an active share of 100 percent is \ncompletely different than its benchmark. To give you some sense of the measure, Fidelity\u2019s Magellan Fund \nhas an active share in the range of 60-65 percent. A fund can have a high active share by owning the stocks \nwithin the index but weighting them very differently, or by owning stocks that are not in the index at all.   \n \nResearchers have suggested that a combination of high active share and low tracking error, or low portfolio \nturnover, has led to excess returns.18 Active share itself is persistent\u2014this comes as no surprise, as it is \nlargely within the portfolio manager\u2019s control. And portfolios with these characteristics have generated excess \nreturns, on average. \n \nLet me make a couple quick final points on active share. The first is that active share has been in steady \ndecline in the last 35 years. Active share in 1980 was around 80 percent, and it\u2019s down to about 55 percent \ntoday. That, of course, excludes index funds and exchange-traded funds. So, more of the market today is \nhugging the benchmark than in the past. \n \nSecond, active share is a nice way to think about fees. Say you are examining a mutual fund with an active \nshare of 50 percent and total expenses of 125 basis points per year. If you work out the math, that fund has \nto generate excess returns in its active component of about 250 basis points in order to get to alpha of zero \n(see Exhibit 4). That\u2019s a difficult task, even for a skilled manager. \n \nExhibit 4: Closet Indexers Need Large Returns on Their Active Investments To Break Even \n                \n \n \n \nPercentage \n                           \n \n \n \nof Portfolio         Excess Return       \nWeighted Return \n \n \n \n \nPassive                      50%  \n \n    \n  0.00%  \n \n \n \n    0.00% \n \n \n \n \nActive                         50%  \n    \n \n  2.50%  \n \n \n \n    1.25% \n \n                   \n   \n \n \n    100% \n \n \n \n \nGross return  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    1.25% \n \n \n \n \nLess expenses  \n \n \n                        \n \n \n \n \n \n        -1.25% \n \n \n \n \nNet return \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       =     0% \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nOn the topic of fees, I\u2019ll also mention that there is no simple relationship between fees and results. In fact, we \nfind the correlation between annual net expense ratio and excess returns to be close to zero. \n \nSo what do you do about all of this? Let me offer three takeaways: \n \uf402\n Recognize that the challenge in finding differential skill among active managers reflects a surfeit, not a \ndearth, of skill. This is the major lesson of the paradox of skill. And it applies well beyond the world of \ninvesting.    \n \uf402\n Remember the story about Jim Rutt: the key to making money is not just proficiency, but finding easy \ngames. In investing, it\u2019s giving a great deal of thought as to why you are\u2014or think you can hire\u2014the \nsmartest person at the poker table.
