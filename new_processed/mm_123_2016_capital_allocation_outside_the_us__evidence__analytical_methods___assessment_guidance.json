      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n3 \nExecutive Summary  \n \uf402\n We extend our analysis of capital allocation beyond the United States to other major world regions, \nincluding Japan, Europe, Asia/Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ), and Global Emerging Markets (GEM). For \nthe most recent report, see Michael J. Mauboussin, Dan Callahan, and Darius Majd, \u201cCapital Allocation: \nEvidence, Analytical Methods, and Assessment Guidance,\u201d Credit Suisse Global Financial Strategies, \nOctober 19, 2016. \n \uf402\n Capital allocation is the most fundamental responsibility of a senior management team of a public \ncorporation. The problem is that many CEOs, while almost universally well intentioned, generally don\u2019t \nknow how to allocate capital effectively. The proper goal of capital allocation is to build long-term value per \nshare. The emphasis is on building value and letting the stock market reflect that value. Companies that \ndwell on boosting their short-term stock price frequently make decisions that are at odds with building \nvalue.  \n \uf402\n Regions and countries vary in the source of funding for capital. In general, high return on investment is \nassociated with an ability to internally fund a substantial percentage of investments. Countries that largely \nfinance investments internally include the U.S., the U.K., and Germany. Countries that require a higher \nproportion of external financing include France, Japan, and China.  \n \uf402\n Academic research shows that rapid asset growth is associated with poor total shareholder returns in most \nregions of the world. Further, companies that contract their assets often create substantial value per \nshare. But these findings are more robust in developed markets than in developing markets. Making \ninvestments that earn a return in excess of the opportunity cost is the key to creating value.  \n \uf402\n Ultimately, the answer to all capital allocation questions is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d Most actions are either foolish or \nwise based on the price and value. Similar to investors, companies tend to buy when times are good and \nretreat when times are challenging, failing to take advantage of gaps between price and value.  \n \uf402\n Past spending patterns are often a good starting point for assessing future spending plans. Once you \nknow how a company spends money, you can dig deeper into management\u2019s decision-making process. \nFurther, it is useful to calculate return on invested capital and return on incremental invested capital. \nThese metrics can provide a sense of the absolute and relative effectiveness of management\u2019s spending. \n \uf402\n Understanding incentives for management is crucial. Assess the degree to which management is focused \non building value and addressing agency costs. \n \uf402\n The five principles of capital allocation include: zero-based capital allocation; fund strategies, not projects; \nno capital rationing; zero tolerance for bad growth; and know the value of assets and be prepared to take \naction.    \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n4 \nSummary of Global Capital Allocation  \n \uf402\n Mergers and acquisitions (M&A), capital expenditures, research and development (R&D), and net working \ncapital are the uses of capital for internal investment. How companies invest internally varies substantially \nby region. (See Exhibit 1.) Here are some of the main observations based on spending in recent decades: \n\uf02d M&A is the largest use of capital in the U.S., Europe, APEJ, and GEM, and the third largest use in \nJapan. The rarity of M&A in Japan is of particular note.  \n\uf02d Capital expenditures are the largest use of capital in Japan and the second largest use in the U.S., \nEurope, AJEJ, and GEM. The range in spending, measured as a percentage of sales, was five times \nas large for M&A as it was for capital expenditures. \n\uf02d R&D is the second largest use of capital in Japan, the third largest in the U.S. and Europe, and the \nfourth largest in APEJ and GEM. Developed markets spend substantially more on R&D than \ndeveloping markets do. \n\uf02d Net working capital is the third largest use of capital in APEJ and GEM, and the smallest use in the \nU.S., Japan, and Europe. This disparity likely reflects the differences in the businesses in the \nrespective economies. \n \uf402\n Divestitures play a significant role in all of the regions except for Japan, constituting roughly one-third the \nlevel of total M&A outside of Japan. They are also larger than dividends and share buybacks in all regions \nbut Japan.   \n \uf402\n Dividends substantially exceed share buybacks in all regions except the U.S., where they have been \nroughly equivalent on average. Buybacks are fairly limited in Europe, APEJ, and GEM and insignificant in \nJapan.  \n \uf402\n Share buybacks have been meaningful in countries that embrace the Anglo-Saxon model and \ninconsequential in nearly all other regions. This pattern reflects cultural and regulatory constraints.  \n \nExhibit 1: Capital Deployment \u2013 Historical Averages for U.S., Japan, Europe, APEJ, and GEM \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae and Thomson Reuters. \nNote: For uses of capital, historical averages are based on the following years: U.S. (1980-2015), Japan (1985-2015), Europe (1985-2015), APEJ (1992-\n2015), GEM (1992-2015), For CFROI\u00ae\uf02a and Real Asset Growth Rates, historical averages are based on the years 1996-2015 for all regions. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n\uf02a  Cash Flow Return on Investment, or CFROI,\n\u00ae is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding \nthe United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse Group AG or its affiliates. \nM&A\nCapex\nR&D \nExpense\nNet Working \nCapital\nDivestitures Dividends\nGross \nBuybacks\nCFROI*\nReal Asset \nGrowth Rate\nU.S.\n10.6%\n7.1%\n2.2%\n0.8%\n3.4%\n2.2%\n2.3%\n9.1%\n5.7%\nJapan\n1.3%\n4.6%\n2.2%\n1.1%\n0.3%\n0.7%\n0.2%\n3.0%\n3.8%\nEurope\n11.4%\n7.0%\n2.0%\n1.3%\n4.2%\n2.2%\n0.6%\n6.9%\n4.2%\nAPEJ\n12.7%\n10.6%\n0.8%\n2.6%\n5.0%\n2.7%\n0.4%\n6.4%\n9.6%\nGEM\n15.8%\n12.0%\n0.4%\n3.3%\n6.3%\n3.2%\n0.5%\n6.0%\n7.5%\nUses of Capital (As a Percentage of Sales)\nEconomic Returns and Growth\nInternal\nReturn of Cash\n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n6 \nIntroduction \n \nCapital allocation is the most fundamental responsibility of a senior management team of a public corporation. \nSuccessful capital allocation means converting inputs, including money, things, ideas, and people, into \nsomething more valuable than they would be otherwise. The net present value (NPV) test is a simple, \nappropriate, and classic way to determine whether management is living up to this responsibility. Passing the \nNPV test means that $1 invested in the business is worth more than $1 in the market. This occurs when the \npresent value of the long-term cash flow from an investment exceeds the initial cost. \n \nWhy should value determine whether a management team is living up to its responsibility? There are two \nreasons. The first is that companies must compete. A company that is allocating its resources wisely will \nultimately prevail over a competitor that is allocating its resources foolishly. The second is that inputs have an \nopportunity cost, or the value of the next best alternative. Unless an input is going to its best and highest use, \nit is underperforming relative to its opportunity cost. \n \nThe process of making inputs more valuable has a number of aspects. A logical starting point is a strategy. \nProperly conceived, a strategy requires a company to specify the trade-offs it will make to establish a position \nin the marketplace that creates value. A strategy also requires a company to align its activities with its \npositioning and to execute effectively.1   \n \nSince a company\u2019s strategy is often already in place when a new chief executive officer (CEO) takes over, \ncapital allocation generally becomes his or her main responsibility. While a proper and comprehensive \ndiscussion of capital allocation requires a consideration of intangible and human resources, our focus here is \non how companies spend money.  \n \nThe problem is that many CEOs, while almost universally well intentioned, don\u2019t know how to allocate capital \neffectively. Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, describes this reality in his 1987 letter \nto shareholders. He discusses the point of why it is beneficial for Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s corporate office to \nallocate the capital of the companies it controls. Buffett is worth quoting at length:2  \n \nThis point can be important because the heads of many companies are not skilled in capital \nallocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising. Most bosses rise to the top because they have excelled in \nan area such as marketing, production, engineering, administration or, sometimes, institutional politics.  \n \nOnce they become CEOs, they face new responsibilities. They now must make capital allocation \ndecisions, a critical job that they may have never tackled and that is not easily mastered. To stretch the \npoint, it\u2019s as if the final step for a highly-talented musician was not to perform at Carnegie Hall but, \ninstead, to be named Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  \n \nThe lack of skill that many CEOs have at capital allocation is no small matter: After ten years on the job, \na CEO whose company annually retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth will have been responsible \nfor the deployment of more than 60% of all the capital at work in the business.  \n \nCEOs who recognize their lack of capital-allocation skills (which not all do) will often try to compensate \nby turning to their staffs, management consultants, or investment bankers. Charlie [Munger] and I have \nfrequently observed the consequences of such \u201chelp.\u201d On balance, we feel it is more likely to \naccentuate the capital-allocation problem than to solve it.  \n \nIn the end, plenty of unintelligent capital allocation takes place in corporate America. (That's why you \nhear so much about \u201crestructuring.\u201d) \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n7 \nIntelligent capital allocation requires understanding the long-term value of an array of opportunities and \nspending money accordingly. It also includes knowing the value of a firm\u2019s individual assets and being willing \nto sell them when they are worth more to others.  \n \nWe believe that long-term growth in value per share should guide capital allocation decisions. A necessary \ncorollary is that there is a time when shrinking the business is the most beneficial course for ongoing \nshareholders. In some cases, for instance, buying back shares is a wiser choice than expanding by means of \ncapital expenditures or acquisition.  \n \nCapital allocation is a dynamic process, so the correct answer to most questions is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d Sometimes \nacquiring makes sense and other times divesting is the better alternative. There are times to issue equity and \ntimes to retire it. Because the components that determine price and value are changing constantly, so too \nmust the assessments that a CEO makes. As Buffett says, \u201cThe first law of capital allocation\u2014whether the \nmoney is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases\u2014is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another.\u201d3 \n \nBuffett also discusses what he calls the \u201cinstitutional imperative,\u201d a force that is also pertinent.4 The force has \nmultiple aspects as he describes it, but a pair of them are relevant here. One is that subordinates will readily \ncreate spreadsheets and studies to support the business craving of the leader. Another is that companies will \n\u201cmindlessly\u201d imitate one another, whether in M&A or executive compensation.  \n \nThe message here should be clear. A decision isn\u2019t good just because someone in the organization can justify \nit or because some other company is doing it. Proper capital allocation requires a sharp analytical framework \nand independence of mind. \n \nIn our experience, very few CEOs, and chief financial officers for that matter, have what we call the \u201cNorth \nStar of value.\u201d The North Star is not the brightest star, but it doesn\u2019t move much throughout the night or year. \nAs a result, it provides a reliable sense of direction. Likewise, companies that have a North Star of value have \nan unwavering view of value no matter what is going on. It is common for executives to solicit input from a \nrange of stakeholders, hear varying points of view, and walk away confused and unsure about the proper \ncourse of action. This doesn\u2019t happen to executives with the North Star of value, especially since they may \nhave better information about their company\u2019s prospects than the market does. \n \nIncentives are another barrier to proper capital allocation. An executive who is paid to deliver a target based on \nshort-term earnings per share may well act very differently than an executive who is focused on building long-\nterm value per share. In assessing management, ask a fundamental question: If there is a conflict between \nmaximizing a reward based on the incentive plan and creating long-term value per share, which route will the \nexecutive select?  \n \nWilliam Thorndike\u2019s excellent book, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational \nBlueprint for Success, inspired our reports on capital allocation.5 Thorndike shares the stories of eight CEOs \nwho created tremendous value per share during their tenures. One theme that comes out clearly in the book, \nand is explicit in the subtitle, is that these CEOs appeared out of step with conventional wisdom as they were \nbuilding value. The North Star of value guided their decisions and they had the independence of mind to make \nthe best choices. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

We then specify a \nframework for considering the economic virtue of each form of capital allocation based on academic \nresearch.  \n \n2. Capital allocation by region. This section documents capital allocation by region, providing historical \ncontext, CFROIs and rates in asset growth, and the trends in capital allocation. \n \n3. Assessing a company\u2019s capital allocation skills. This part discusses methods to assess past \ncapital allocation choices, how to evaluate incentives, and the five principles of capital allocation.  \n \nPart I: Groundwork \u2013 Where Does the Money Come From and Where Has It Gone?  \n \nIf the job of management is to deploy capital so as to add value, it makes sense to start with a discussion of \nwhere capital comes from and how management teams have spent it in the past. The sources of capital \ninclude the cash the business generates and access to the capital of claimholders, including debtors and \nshareholders. A company can also sell an asset, which is a one-time realization of the cash flow the asset is \nexpected to generate over its life.   \n \nBusinesses that grow rapidly generally require a sizeable amount of investment. For example, imagine a \nrestaurant concept that is highly successful. To satiate demand that firm must build lots of restaurants and \nhence invest a substantial sum in expansion. The rate of return on incremental capital is the maximum growth \nrate in operating profit a business can reach without external financing. By extension, a company with a return \non invested capital (ROIC) greater than its growth rate will generate surplus capital.6  \n   \nCompanies that cannot fund their growth internally must access cash externally, either by borrowing or selling \nequity. The pecking order theory is an idea in corporate finance that says that managers of companies will \ntypically choose to fund investments first with cash that the company generates internally, next with debt, and \nfinally with equity.7 One essential tenet of thoughtful capital allocation is that all capital has an opportunity cost, \nwhether the source is internal or external. \n \nThe uses of capital are where the money goes. Executives can invest in the business through capital \nexpenditures, increases in working capital, research and development, or mergers and acquisitions. These \ninvestments allow a company to grow. But growth, in and of itself, is never the goal of a thoughtful capital \nallocator. The proper metric of success is an increase in long-term value per share. \n \nA company can also return cash to debt and equity holders. Debt repayment, a return of some or all principal \nand interest a company owes, is straightforward. A company can return cash to shareholders either by paying \na dividend, where all holders receive the same amount, or by buying back stock. In a buyback, shareholders \nsort themselves. Those who want cash sell their shares and those who want to increase their stake in the \ncompany hold their shares. A dividend treats all shareholders the same no matter what the stock price. \n  \nIn a buyback, selling shareholders benefit at the expense of ongoing shareholders if the stock is overvalued, \nand ongoing shareholders benefit at the expense of selling shareholders if the stock is undervalued. All \nshareholders are treated uniformly only if the stock price is at fair value.8  \n \nExhibit 3 summarizes the sources and uses of financial capital. These follow closely the alternatives and \nchoices that Thorndike specifies in The Outsiders.   \n"

Issuance of new debt is the next most \nsignificant source of capital. The issuance of equity varies a great deal by region, and companies in developed \neconomies commonly retire as much equity as they issue.  \n \nThe ratio of internal financing to the total source of capital tends to correlate with the underlying return on \ninvested capital for the country. A country with a high ROIC can fund a higher percentage of its investments \nwith internally-generated cash than can a country with a low ROIC. Exhibit 4 shows this correlation, using cash \nflow return on investment (CFROI) as a measure of return on investment. The data reflect the average of the \nten years ended 2015.9 \n \nThere are pros and cons to having internal financing represent a high percentage of investment funding. The \npro is that companies are earning high returns on capital in general and need not rely on capital markets to \nfund their growth. The con is that companies can deploy internally-generated funds into value-destroying \ninvestments. The need to raise money from the capital markets creates a check on management\u2019s spending \nplans.  \n \nIndeed, Peter Bernstein, the renowned financial historian and economist, once suggested that all companies \nshould be required to pay out 100 percent of their earnings and then appeal to the markets when they want \nfunds for investment. He argued that markets are more effective than companies at allocating capital, and as \na result the overall effectiveness of capital allocation would improve if left to the devices of the market.10    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCapital allocation\nReturn cash \nto claimholders\nBusiness\nCapital expenditures \nWorking capital\nMergers/acquisitions\nResearch & development\nCapital sources\nEquity issuance\nDebt issuance\nBusiness\nOperational cash flow\nAsset sales\nAccess cash \nfrom claimholders\nCash dividends\nShare buybacks\nDebt repayment\n"

A key finding is that asset growth rates are strong predictors of future abnormal \nreturns to shareholders in countries with developed financial markets. The effect is weaker, if present, in \ndeveloping economies.11  \n \nMore specifically, developed markets firms with low asset growth rates earn substantially higher shareholder \nreturns, after adjusting for risk, than firms with high asset growth rates. Further, companies that contract their \nassets tend to generate higher shareholder returns than companies that expand their assets.  \n \nHigh returns to shareholders tend to follow events such as spin-offs, dividend initiations, share repurchases, \nand debt prepayments, whereas low returns to shareholders generally follow events such as acquisitions and \nstock and debt issuance.  \n \nA global study of 40 countries reveals that from 1982-2010 the relationship between asset growth and \nshareholder results was strong in Europe, with 14 of the 17 countries in the study showing the relationship \n(Greece, Italy, and Portugal were the exceptions).

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n11 \nUses of Capital \n \nWe now turn to the details of the major uses of capital. We discuss how to assess each alternative from an \neconomic standpoint and summarize the findings of the empirical research. The subsequent part reviews the \ndetails of the historical trends for the uses of capital in each region.  \n \nMergers and Acquisitions. M&A is a major source of redistribution of corporate resources. For many \ncompanies, M&A is the most significant means to pursue strategic goals and the most costly way to do so. \nNearly all companies and investment portfolios will feel the effect of M&A at some point. Consider that over \nthe past twenty years, M&A volume as a fraction of the total equity market capitalization has averaged 14 \npercent in Europe, 11 percent in GEM, 10 percent in APEJ, 9 percent in the U.S., and 3 percent in Japan.  \n \nM&A tends to follow the stock market closely, with more M&A activity when the stock market is up. It comes as no \nsurprise that companies that act early in an M&A cycle tend to generate higher returns than those that act later. \nThe first movers in an M&A wave enjoy the benefits of a larger pool of acquisition targets and cheaper valuations \nthan companies that acquire later in the cycle. Later acquirers are encouraged to act based on bandwagon effects, \nor what Buffett calls the institutional imperative, and an accommodating environment for financing.12  \n \nOne of the most effective ways to assess the merit of a deal is to compare the present value of incremental \ncash flow, the result of synergy, to the premium the acquirer agrees to pay.13 If the synergy exceeds the \npremium, the deal will add value for the buyer. If the synergy is less than the premium, the buyer will see its \nshares decline. The relationship between synergy and premium is more explanatory than the measures that \ncompanies and investors commonly use, including earnings accretion or dilution.14  \n \nHere\u2019s an example. Assume that the market capitalization is $2,000 for the buyer and $800 for the seller. \nThe buyer bids $1,000 for the seller, representing a $200 premium. If the synergy is only $100, the market \ncapitalization of the buyer will slump to $1,900 and the seller will receive $1,000. If, on the other hand, the \nsynergy is $300, the market capitalization of the buyer will rise to $2,100 as the seller receives $1,000.  \n \nAlthough the key factors in judging M&A are the synergy and the premium, only the premium is explicit. While \ncompanies today generally provide some guidance for expected synergy, the investor must still assess the \nlikelihood that the company will achieve the objective. M&A creates value in the aggregate as the combined \nvalue of the buyer and target is almost always higher after a deal is announced than before. But buyers \ncommonly overpay, which means the seller\u2019s shareholders often capture the value of the synergy.   \n \nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures have been the largest source of investment in Japan and APEJ, and \nare a large percentage of spending in GEM. As a broad rule of thumb, spending on capital expenditures, measured \nas a percentage of sales, is larger in developing countries than in developed countries. Further, the growth in capital \nexpenditures tends to come with low variance, which means that executives want to keep the spending steady.  \n \nExecutives and investors frequently distinguish between \u201cmaintenance\u201d capital expenditures and total capital \nexpenditures. Maintenance spending is the minimum required to maintain or replace the long-term assets in \nplace. We can assume that capital expenditures beyond the maintenance level are in pursuit of growth.    \n \nDepreciation expense serves as a rough proxy for maintenance capital spending.15 Measured as a percentage \nof sales, growth capital expenditures range from one-fifth to one-half of overall capital expenditures across the \ndifferent regions. That maintenance capital expenditures are essential explains a good deal of the stability of \nspending. Further, it suggests that in assessing the value creation prospects of capital expenditures, you are \nbest served to focus on the component that supports growth. \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n12 \nThe stock market tends to favorably greet increases in capital expenditures for companies that have attractive \nreturns on invested capital and a good record of past spending. The market expresses skepticism at increases \nfor low return on capital businesses or businesses that are at or near a cyclical peak.16  \n \n \nResearch and Development. Unlike M&A and capital expenditures, R&D is an expense on the income \nstatement rather than invested capital on the balance sheet. Accountants expense R&D in the period the \ncompany incurs it, notwithstanding the potential long-term benefits, because they deem the outcomes too \nuncertain and difficult to quantify. We can define R&D as a set of activities that seeks to develop new \nproducts or the tools to create new products.  \n \nIn the U.S., businesses account for about 70-75 percent of total R&D spending, with the government and \nacademia splitting the other 25-30 percent. The industries that spend the most include information technology, \nhealthcare, materials, and aerospace and defense. Technology and healthcare combined represent more than \ntwo-thirds of all R&D spending in the U.S., and technology R&D spending is roughly 1.6 times that of \nhealthcare. \n \nR&D spending averages about two percent of revenues in developed economies including the U.S., Japan, \nand Europe. That ratio is less than one percent in APEJ and GEM. The U.S., China, and Japan together \nrepresent more than half of global R&D spending, and ten countries account for about 80 percent of the total. \nAt current rates of funding and growth, China will surpass the U.S. as the largest spender on R&D by the year \n2026.17   \n \nThe academic research on the effectiveness of R&D spending is somewhat equivocal, in part because of the \nmeasurement challenges and the decline in R&D productivity in the pharmaceutical industry. One of the best \nways to study the market\u2019s reaction to any form of investment is to examine unexpected changes. In one such \nstudy, finance professors studied more than 8,000 unexpected increases in R&D spending over a 50-year \nperiod ended in 2001 and found that the stocks of those companies rose.18 Other researchers conclude that \nthe returns to R&D are positive and higher than other capital investments.19 \n \nA reasonable question is whether the stock market effectively reflects R&D spending. One large study found \nthat the market does it well. This means that companies that spend a large percentage of sales on R&D \nrealize similar stock market returns as companies that spend a small percentage of sales on R&D. The \nresearchers came to similar conclusions for advertising expenses, which are about one-half as large as R&D \nexpenses in the aggregate.20  \n \nAcademics have also found that larger companies that acquire their R&D by buying businesses that are R&D \nintensive tend to fare poorly in the stock market.21 This is consistent with the view that the value of R&D in an \nacquisition ultimately accrues to the seller, not the buyer. That said, companies with strong execution \ncapabilities can create value by enhancing R&D effectiveness.22 \n     \nOne study focused specifically on Japan found that the stock market properly reflected R&D spending. \nSpecifically, it showed that companies that spent a large percentage of sales on R&D realized similar total \nshareholder returns as companies that spent a small percentage.23 \n \nSome recent research suggests that the technology companies in the U.S. that are in the bottom one-third of \nR&D spending as a percentage of sales deliver higher returns to shareholders than those in the top third.24 \nThis finding underscores how tricky it is to assess R&D spending because a number of technology companies \nhave benefitted from R&D that was funded by the government. \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n13 \nMariana Mazzucato, a professor of economics at the University of Sussex, addresses this issue in her \nprovocative book, The Entrepreneurial State.25 Her thesis is that the government funds a great deal of high-\nrisk R&D that companies go on to exploit commercially.  \n \nShe uses the vivid example of the iPhone from Apple Inc., a company that has created a huge amount of \nshareholder value in the past decade. Four of the main technologies inside the iPhone, including the Global \nPositioning System (GPS), the Internet, touch screen, and voice recognition software, were developed by the \nU.S. government. As Mazzucato notes, Apple did a brilliant job of integrating these technologies, designing an \nattractive and intuitive product, and marketing effectively. But it did not develop some of the key technologies \ninside the phone, which means the company\u2019s shareholders did not have to shoulder those expenses.   \n \nNet Working Capital. Net working capital is the capital a company requires to run its day-to-day operations. \nIt is defined as current assets minus non-interest-bearing current liabilities. The primary components of net \nworking capital include inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Interest-bearing current liabilities, \nwhich include short-term debt and the current maturities of long-term debt, are a form of financing and are \ntherefore not part of net working capital. \n \nFor the purpose of capital allocation, we analyze the change in net working capital. Net working capital is a \nsubstantially larger use of capital in developing markets than in developed markets. For instance, changes in \nnet working capital have averaged 3.3 percent of sales in GEM and 2.6 percent in APEJ compared to less \nthan 1.5 percent of sales in Europe, Japan, and the U.S.  \n \nDivestitures. Companies use divestitures to adjust their business portfolio. Actions include the sale of \ndivisions, spin-offs, and equity carve-outs. A company will divest an operation when it perceives the value to \nanother owner to be higher, or if the divestiture adds focus to the parent and hence improves results. \n \nThere are a few considerations in assessing divestitures. First, research has established that most of the value \ncreation for a typical company comes from a relatively small percentage of its assets.26 This means that most \ncompanies have businesses or assets that do not earn the cost of capital and that may be more valuable to \nanother owner.  \n \nDivestitures can lead to \u201caddition by subtraction\u201d when a company that divests an operation with a low return \non invested capital receives more than what the business is worth as an ongoing part of the firm. So there\u2019s \nan addition to value even as there\u2019s a subtraction from the size of the firm. \n \nSecond, we have already reviewed the evidence showing that M&A creates value in the aggregate but that \nacquirers struggle to capture much, if any, of that value. This suggests that it is better to be a seller than a \nbuyer on average. This point is particularly relevant when there are multiple bidders for an asset. Contested \ndeals frequently lead to what economists call the \u201cwinner\u2019s curse.\u201d27 When this occurs, the \u201cwinner\u201d of the \nbidding pays too much for the asset, hence the \u201ccurse.\u201d The winner\u2019s curse means that there is a wealth \ntransfer, above and beyond the value of the asset, from the buyer to the seller. \n \nFinally, most companies have a natural tendency to want to grow rather than shrink. As companies grow and \ndiversify, capital allocation and strategic control can become more challenging. When a CEO who understands \ncapital allocation takes the helm of a company with underperforming assets, there is a great opportunity to \ncreate value through divestitures.28   \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n14 \nNotwithstanding their significance in capital allocation, divestitures have received substantially less attention \nthan M&A in the academic literature. Research for the most part concludes that divestitures create value. A \nmeta-analysis of nearly 100 studies on divestitures concludes: \u201cIn the broadest possible terms, our results \nsuggest that on average, divestiture actions are associated with positive performance outcomes for the \ndivesting parent firm.\u201d29 \n \nAnalysis also shows that spin-offs create value for the spin-offs themselves as well as the corporate parents.30 \nResearchers who did a meta-analysis of more than 25 papers in the spin-off literature summed up their \nfindings this way: \u201cThe main conclusion is consistent: spin-offs are associated with strongly significant \nabnormal returns.\u201d31 They suggest the factors that explain these wealth effects include sharpened focus, \nbetter information, and in some cases tax treatment.  \n \nDividends. A dividend is a cash payment to a shareholder that is generally paid from profits. Dividends and \nshare buybacks are the main ways companies return cash to shareholders. Companies can also return cash to \nshareholders by selling the company for cash. \n \nThe most profound difference between buybacks and dividends may be the attitude of executives. Most \nexecutives believe that once a dividend is established, paying it is on par with investment decisions such as \ncapital spending. In contrast, they tend to view buybacks as something to do with residual cash flow after the \ncompany has made all investments that are appropriate.32  \n \nThere are a couple of consequences of this difference in attitude. The first is that dividend payments are vastly \nless volatile than buybacks. Indeed, of all the capital allocation options, dividends have among the lowest \nstandard deviation in growth. \n \nHow should investors assess dividends? First, dividends are useful to consider in the context of cash flow. To \nsustain a cash dividend, a company has to generate cash flow beyond the basic needs to maintain the \nbusiness and support its growth. So an investor should gauge a company\u2019s cash flow prospects in order to \nanticipate a company\u2019s ability to pay dividends.33    \n \nSecond, dividends can play an important role in the capital accumulation rate, also known as total shareholder \nreturn (TSR). From time to time you hear that dividends provide the bulk of shareholder returns for equities in \nthe long run. That assertion is wrong if you assume the goal of an investor is to accumulate capital. In fact, \nprice appreciation is the only source of investment return that increases accumulated capital over time.34 \n \nThe equity rate of return is a one-period measure and is simply the sum of stock price appreciation and the \ndividend. The capital accumulation rate, or TSR, is a multi-period measure that assumes all dividends are \nreinvested in the stock. Knowing price appreciation and dividend yield, the following equation allows you to \ncalculate TSR: \n \nTotal shareholder return (TSR) = Price appreciation + [(1 + price appreciation) * dividend yield] \n \nThe value of the compounding reinvested dividends means that the equity rate of return is always lower than \nthe TSR as long as price appreciation is positive. For example, assume price appreciation of 7 percent and a \ndividend yield of 2 percent. The equity rate of return is 9 percent (.07 + .02) and the TSR is 9.14 percent (.07 + \n[(1 + .07)*.02]).   \n \nThe key is that for an investor to actually earn the TSR, all of the dividends they receive must be reinvested back \ninto the stock. That\u2019s why price appreciation only determines the TSR.   \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n15 \nIt\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that almost no one earns the full TSR because most individuals do not reinvest the \ndividends they receive, and dividends are generally taxable. While there are no clear-cut data on the topic, it \nappears that only one-tenth of all dividend proceeds are reinvested. Naturally, investors can use dividends to \nconsume. But if they do, they can\u2019t earn the TSR. \n \nFurther, most investors must pay taxes on the dividends they receive. The TSR declines when you assume \nthat only a fraction is reinvested in the stock. Academic research supports the view that the tax rate on \npayouts affects shareholder returns.35 \n \nAcademic research on dividends supports a few points. To begin, older companies are more likely to pay \ndividends than younger companies. So any analysis of dividend yields must take into account the maturity of \nthe population of companies under consideration.36      \n \nSecond, dividends provide a strong signal about management\u2019s commitment to distribute cash to shareholders \nand its confidence in the future earnings of the business. This is consistent with the managerial attitude that \ndividends are sacrosanct once declared. For this reason, companies are very deliberate about the decision to \ninitiate a dividend.37  \n \nDividend payouts are generally more generous in developing markets than in developed markets. Dividends as \na percentage of sales averaged 3.2 percent in GEM and 2.7 percent in APEJ in the past couple of decades, \nhigher than the 2.2 percent in the U.S. and Europe. Japan\u2019s payout rate has been consistently below the \naverage of other regions of the world, with dividends as a percentage of sales of 0.7 percent in the past 30 \nyears. \n \nShare Buybacks. A share buyback is the second way that a company can return cash to its shareholders. \nWhereas all shareholders are treated equally with a dividend, only shareholders who sell to the company \nreceive cash. This means that shareholders realize very different outcomes based on whether they choose to \nsell or hold the stock when they deem it to be overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.  \n \nWhen assessing a repurchase program, investors and executives should consider the golden rule of share \nbuybacks, which states: A company should repurchase its shares only when its stock is trading below its \nexpected value and when no better investment opportunities are available.38 \n \nThe golden rule addresses both absolute and relative value. Companies should only invest where they \nanticipate a payoff that has a positive net present value. This is a fancy way of saying \u201cyou will get more than \nwhat you pay for.\u201d This absolute benchmark applies to all of a company\u2019s capital allocation decisions, including \nM&A, capital expenditures, and R&D.  \n \nThe rule also addresses relative value when it emphasizes that companies should prioritize higher return \ninternal investment opportunities over buybacks. Ideally, executives should rank their investment opportunities \nby expected return and fund them from highest to lowest. A company should expect that all of the investments \nit funds will earn above the cost of capital. There can be cases when buybacks are more attractive than \ninvesting in the business.39 \n \nThe second aspect of assessing a buyback is its impact on various shareholders under different conditions. \nOnly if a stock trades exactly at intrinsic value do buybacks and dividends treat all shareholders the same. If a \nstock is overvalued or undervalued, the effect of a buyback is different for selling shareholders than it is for \nthose who continue to hold. \n \n"

What differs is who wins and who loses as the result of buying stock below or above intrinsic value. \nSince management should focus on building value per share for continuing shareholders, it should always try \nto buy back shares that are undervalued.    \n \nTo be more concrete, if a company buys back shares that are overvalued the selling shareholders gain at the \nexpense of ongoing shareholders. The premium to intrinsic value accrues to the sellers and the value per \nshare for the ongoing holders goes down accordingly.  \n \nIf a company buys back shares that are undervalued the selling shareholders lose at the expense of ongoing \nshareholders. The discount to intrinsic value accrues to the ongoing shareholders and the selling shareholders \nfail to realize value.  \n \nThis analysis suggests a couple of points that investors commonly overlook. First, if you are the shareholder of \na company that is buying back stock, doing nothing is doing something. By choosing to hold the shares \ninstead of selling a pro-rated amount, you are effectively increasing your percentage ownership in the \ncompany. One alternative is to sell shares in proportion to your stake, creating a homemade dividend and \nmaintaining a steady percentage ownership in the business. \n \nSecond, it is logical that you would prefer that the companies you hold in your portfolio buy back stock rather \nthan pay a dividend. If you own shares of companies that you think are undervalued, buybacks will increase \nvalue per share by definition. The only instance where this may not be true is if you believe that a dividend \nwould provide a more powerful signal to the market, hence creating more value than a buyback. \n \nTying together these thoughts, there are basically three schools of thought regarding buybacks: fair value, \nintrinsic value, and accounting-motivated. The intrinsic value school is where you want to be if possible. \n \nThe fair value school takes a steady and consistent approach to buybacks. Management believes that over \ntime it will buy back shares when they are both overvalued and undervalued, but for the most part when they \nare about fairly priced. This approach offers shareholders substantial flexibility as it allows them to hold shares \nand defer tax liabilities or create homemade dividends by selling a pro-rated number of shares.  \n \nThe fair value school is consistent with the free cash flow hypothesis, which says that managers who have \nexcess cash will invest it in projects with a negative net present value. By disbursing cash, a company buying \nback its shares reduces the risk of doing something foolish with the funds.40 Research suggests that most \ncompanies would have been better off buying back stock consistently versus their actual behavior of buying \nheavily in some periods and lightly, or not at all, in others.41 \n \nThe intrinsic value school believes a company should only buy back shares when it deems them to be \nundervalued. A company must have asymmetric information or beliefs, as well as analytical prowess, to \nprofitably pursue this approach. Asymmetric information means that company management has information \nthat the stock price fails to reflect. Differing beliefs occur when management has the same information as the \nmarket but comes to different conclusions about what that information means.  \n \nAnalytical prowess means that the executives at the company know how to translate their differential view into \nan estimate of the relationship between the stock price and intrinsic value. Investors should not assume that \nmanagement has this ability. Indeed, surveys consistently show that executives believe their stock to be cheap.  \n \n"

Further, it is important to focus on actual share buybacks versus buyback \nannouncements. The evidence supporting the signaling hypothesis is mixed, but 85 percent of CFOs believe \nthat their buyback decision conveys information.43      \n \nBoosting short-term accounting results, especially earnings per share (EPS), is what motivates the final \nschool.44 When surveyed, three-fourths of CFOs cite increasing EPS as an important or very important factor \nin the decision to buy back shares. Two-thirds of CFOs say that offsetting the dilution from option or other \nstock-based programs is important. This underscores another essential point: you should consider buybacks \nnet of equity issuance.  \n \nThe problem with the accounting-motivated school is that its actions are not necessarily aligned with the \nprinciple of value creation.45 For example, there may be a case where buying back overvalued stock boosts \nEPS and helps management reach a financial objective that prompts a bonus. In this case the motivation is \nimpure because management\u2019s proper goal is to allocate capital in an economically sound fashion for \nshareholders.  \n \nInvestors assessing companies buying back stock should make an effort to determine which school the \nmanagement is in. It can be the case that management buys back stock for the right reason and realizes \naccounting benefits as a result. That\u2019s fine. But investors should be on the lookout for companies that make \ndecisions based on the accounting results without sufficient regard for the economic merits.    \n \nA couple of findings from the academic research are worth highlighting. The first is that it appears companies \nare increasingly using buybacks as a substitute for dividends.46 As a result, total shareholder yield (sum of \ndividends and buybacks divided by equity market capitalization) may be a better indicator of a company\u2019s \nproclivity to pay out than a simple dividend yield.  \n \nSecond, a global study found that share buybacks generate positive excess returns on balance, but that the \nresults differed across regions. Buybacks led to positive excess returns in Japan, APEJ, and several \nprominent GEM countries, but did not do so in Europe. The researchers suggest the source of the positive \nreturns is the ability of management teams to take advantage of undervalued stock prices.47 \n \nWe now turn to capital allocation by region. Before we do, here\u2019s a quick comment on currency. Credit Suisse \nHOLT\u00ae converts the numbers based on local currencies into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. This \napplies to R&D, capital expenditures, buybacks, dividends, and net working capital data.

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n19 \nSimilar to 2015, capital expenditures and R&D are the largest uses of capital over time. An examination of the \nchanges from 1985 through 2015 reveals some noteworthy patterns:  \n \uf402\n Capital expenditures are by far the largest use of capital. Historically, capital expenditures have been \nmore than double the level of R&D spending and nearly four times that of M&A. Capital expenditures \nhave been fairly steady over time. In 2015, they were 5.1 percent of total sales, slightly above the long-\nterm average. But the fraction of capital expenditures to the total sum that companies allocate has \ndeclined over the decades. This reflects a change in the composition of the economy, with businesses \nthat require less capital investment replacing those that require more. (See Exhibit 7.) For example, the \nenergy, materials, and industrial sectors represented 42 percent of the market capitalization of the top \n1,000 companies in the Japanese market in 1985 but just 26 percent in 2015.  \n \uf402\n R&D spending has shown a gradual rise from 1.6 percent of sales in 1985 to 2.4 percent in 2015. \nThese levels make Japan one of the world\u2019s leaders in R&D spending, and the ratio has been steady \nover the years. Japan\u2019s large presence in R&D-intensive sectors explains its level of spending.  \n \uf402\n M&A plays a much smaller role in Japan than it does in other major countries and regions. M&A volume \nwas only 1.9 percent of sales in 2015, slightly above its long-term average. Legal and cultural factors \nexplain why M&A was negligible until the late 1990s. For much of Japan\u2019s history, society frowned on \nM&A and gaining approval for deals was difficult because of the interlocking and diffuse ownership \nstructure of corporations. M&A activity picked up when Japan instituted new laws to increase investor \nprotection and as the legacy corporate ownership structure began to change. \n \uf402\n The return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks was paltry before Japan adopted a \nseries of regulatory reforms in the 1990s. The government first made buybacks legal in 1994 and then \nmade their tax treatment less punitive a few years later. Further, corporate governance reforms that were \nfriendly to investors spurred more M&A activity and boosted corporate payouts overall. The buyback yield \n(buybacks as a percentage of total market capitalization) went from zero in 1985-1999 to 0.7 percent in \n2000-2015, while the dividend yield rose from 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent. \n \nExhibit 7: Japan Sector Composition, 1985-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT.  \nNote: Data for telecom sector not available for 1985-1987. \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nFinancials\nUtilities\nTelecom\nInformation Technology\nHealthcare\nConsumer Staples\nEnergy\nConsumer Discretionary\nIndustrials\nMaterials\n"

Low \nROIC or high payout businesses can certainly grow but need to access debt or equity capital to do so. \n \nPart of the explanation for Japan\u2019s low payout ratio is the country\u2019s low CFROI.

But Japan\u2019s CFROI is well below the 20-year average of 9 percent in the \nU.S. and 7 percent in Europe. Further, Japan\u2019s current CFROI remains below the peak years of the mid-\n2000s. \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n28 \nDividends. Exhibit 20 shows the annual amount of dividends on common and preferred stock for the top \n1,000 companies in Japan, excluding the financial services and regulated utility industries, from 1985 to 2015. \nThe average dividend payout ratio, or dividends as a percentage of net income, was roughly 35 percent. The \naverage dividend yield, or dividend payment as a percentage of total market capitalization, was 1.2 percent. \n \nIn general, dividends do not move around too much from year to year in Japan, but they do show a notable \nuptick beginning in the early 2000s. From 1985-1999, the average dividend yield was only 0.8 percent. From \n2000-2015, that figure almost doubled to 1.5 percent.  \n \nThe corporate governance reform that led to greater M&A activity also unleashed a surge in corporate \npayout.49 These legislative reforms, which gained momentum in 1999, created a better environment for \ncompanies and shareholders, including new laws that increase investor protection. The result has been more \ngenerous dividends and buybacks across the board. However, keiretsu firms still continue to favor dividends \nover buybacks, and their payouts remain more sensitive to fluctuations than those of non-keiretsu companies.  \n \nExhibit 20: Japan Common and Preferred Dividends, 1985-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: Top 1,000 industrial firms. Dollar amounts not inflated. \n \nShare Buybacks. Exhibit 21 shows the annual amount of gross buybacks for the top 1,000 companies in \nJapan from 1985 to 2015. Buybacks totaled roughly 10 percent of net income over the full period. The \naverage buyback yield, or buybacks as a percentage of total market capitalization, was 0.4 percent, well below \nthe 1.2 percent dividend yield.  \n \nBut the average belies the fact that buybacks were virtually nonexistent until the late 1990s because they \nwere illegal until 1994. Even after the government legalized buybacks, significant tax disadvantages and \nregulatory hurdles remained for several years. Only the removal of these limitations and a wave of \nshareholder-friendly corporate governance reforms led to the recent surge in buybacks. \n \nThe numbers tell the story. From 1985-1999, the average buyback yield was zero. From 2000-2015, it was \n0.7 percent. This yield is less than one half the 1.5 percent dividend yield during the same period, but the \ndisparity is far less. The balance remains in favor of dividends because the keiretsu firms are reluctant to \nembrace buybacks.  \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n0\n10,000\n20,000\n30,000\n40,000\n50,000\n60,000\n70,000\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nAs a percentage of net income\n$ Millions\nDollar amount\nAs a percentage of net income\n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n31 \nM&A has been the biggest use of capital over time but capital expenditures are not far behind. An examination \nof the results from 1985 through 2015 reveals some noteworthy patterns: \n \uf402\n M&A has been the largest use of capital, but it is very cyclical. M&A has been in a range of 2 percent of \nsales in 1985 to 44 percent at the peak in the late 1990s. M&A activity in Europe substantially lagged \nthat of the U.S. in the late 1980s, but has since closed the gap as the result of political and economic \nfactors. The introduction of the euro, globalization, and privatization stimulated M&A activity, especially for \ncross-border deals within the region. Greater participation from countries in Continental Europe also \npushed volumes higher. \n \uf402\n Capital expenditures have been in a tight range of roughly 6 percent to 9 percent over the period. In \n2015, they were 6.5 percent of total sales, modestly below the long-term average of 7 percent. One \nexplanation for this stability is that the composition of the economy has been steady over time. (See \nExhibit 24.) For example, the energy, materials, and industrial sectors, which tend to require more capital \ninvestment, represented roughly one quarter of the market capitalization in 1985 and 2015.  \n \uf402\n Share buybacks were extremely rare until the mid-1990s as the result of legal bans and strict regulations \non implementation and disclosure. European governments have largely overturned these bans and \nloosened the constraints, although many restrictions remain in place regarding the timing, price, and \nallowed amounts of buybacks. Companies have shifted their method of payouts following these changes, \nbut they still heavily favor dividends. The volume of buybacks reached 60 percent of dividends in 2007, \nbut has since retreated to one-quarter in 2015. \n \uf402\n R&D expenditures have been between 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent of sales, and have averaged 2.0 \npercent of sales over the full period. This level is below both the U.S. and Japan. Europe\u2019s small \ninformation technology sector contributes to the gap. Historically, IT has constituted just 4 percent of \nEurope\u2019s economy, compared to 15 percent in the U.S. and 12 percent in Japan. European corporations \nonly account for about 60 percent of the overall R&D spending for their economy, well below the roughly \n70 percent in the U.S. and 80 percent in Japan.  \n \nExhibit 24: Europe Sector Composition, 1985-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT.  \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nFinancials\nUtilities\nTelecom\nInformation Technology\nHealthcare\nConsumer Staples\nEnergy\nConsumer Discretionary\nIndustrials\nMaterials\n"

The long-term average is roughly 13 percent, modestly higher than \nthe levels of the U.S. and Europe. China really stands out, as its share of the region\u2019s total M&A went \nfrom less than 5 percent in the early 1990s to more than one-half in recent years.  \n \uf402\n Capital expenditures are the second largest use of capital. Capital expenditures were 9 percent of total \nsales in 2015, below the long-term average of 10.6 percent. Measured as a percentage of sales, \nAPEJ\u2019s capital expenditures greatly exceed those of the U.S., Japan, and Europe. \n \uf402\n R&D spending has slowly trended higher over time but remains well below that of the U.S., Japan, and \nEurope both on an absolute basis and relative to sales. R&D rose steadily from 0.5 percent of sales in \n1992 to 1.1 percent of sales in the mid-2000s, then dipped slightly before rebounding to an all-time high \nof 1.2 percent in 2015. This rise reflects the change in the composition of the market, with the \ninformation technology sector growing from just 1 percent of the market in 1992 to roughly 10 percent in \nrecent years. (See Exhibit 41.) \n \uf402\n Share buybacks have historically been very modest and remain a small component of corporate payouts. \nBuybacks have averaged just 0.3 percent of total market capitalization over time, well below dividends at \n2.1 percent. Regulatory constraints have contributed to the lower level of buybacks, particularly in the \nearlier years. For example, the governments didn\u2019t legalize buybacks in Australia until 1989 and in Hong \nKong until 1991. These are among the largest economies in the region. In 2015, buybacks in China, \nIndia, and Taiwan were negligible.  \n \nExhibit 41: APEJ Sector Composition, 1992-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT.  \n \n \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nFinancials\nUtilities\nTelecom\nInformation Technology\nHealthcare\nConsumer Staples\nEnergy\nConsumer Discretionary\nIndustrials\nMaterials\n"

Exhibit 47 shows the dollar amount of M&A, as well as M&A as a percentage of \nsales, from 1992 to 2015. M&A is very cyclical, ranging from a low of 6.3 percent of sales in 2012 to a high \nof 26.7 percent in 2000. On an absolute basis M&A volume shattered the all-time record in 2015. Measured \nas a percentage of sales, M&A volume was 20 percent, well above the long-term average of 13 percent. This \nhistorical average is modestly higher than the levels of the U.S. and Europe. The absolute level of M&A in \nAPEJ is still only roughly one-half that of the U.S., but it surpassed that of Europe for the first time in 2015. \n \nOne notable difference across the regions is that absolute M&A volumes recovered more rapidly following the \nfinancial crisis in APEJ than it did in the U.S. and Europe. Only in 2015 did worldwide deal volume return to \nthe level of 2007.  \n  \nOn a country basis, China leads the deal making in APEJ. Its share of the region\u2019s total M&A went from less \nthan 5 percent in the early 1990s to more than one-half in recent years. Hong Kong, Australia, and South \nKorea were the next biggest contributors in 2015, representing 12 percent, 9 percent, and 6 percent of the \nregion\u2019s total M&A, respectively.

Overall, buybacks remain a very small component of the corporate payout in APEJ. \n \nBuybacks have been roughly six percent of net income, on average, from 1992-2015. The average buyback \nyield, or buybacks as a percentage of total market capitalization, was 0.3 percent over the same period, \nsignificantly below the 2.1 percent dividend yield. In 2015, the buyback yield was 0.3 percent. The Philippines, \nAustralia, and Korea were the only countries in the region with relevant buyback yields, at 2.1 percent, 1.7 \npercent, and 1.1 percent, respectively. China and India had a zero yield, Taiwan had a 0.1 percent yield, and \nHong Kong had a 0.2 percent yield. \n \nRegulatory constraints contributed to the lower level of buybacks in the earlier years. For example, the \ngovernment of Australia did not legalize buybacks until 1989 and Hong Kong did not legalize them until 1991. \nThese are two of the largest economies in the region.57   \n \n \n \n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n50%\n0\n20,000\n40,000\n60,000\n80,000\n100,000\n120,000\n140,000\n160,000\n180,000\n200,000\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nAs a percentage of net income\n$ Millions\nDollar amount\nAs a percentage of net income\n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n55 \nM&A and capital expenditures are by far the largest uses of capital over time. An examination of the changes \nfrom 1992 through 2015 reveals some noteworthy patterns: \n \uf402\n M&A is very cyclical, ranging from a low of 8 percent of sales in 2013 to a high of 33 percent of sales in \n1998. The long-term average of 16 percent of sales exceeds the 11 percent level shared by the U.S. and \nEurope and the 13 percent level of APEJ. The absolute level of M&A in GEM has grown considerably \nsince the early 1990s as the result of strong economic growth and business reforms. The BRIC countries \n(Brazil, Russia, India, and China) now dominate M&A activity in the region. Together they accounted for \n88 percent of the total in 2015, up from a share of 10 percent in 1992. China alone accounted for 78 \npercent of the total in 2015.  \n \uf402\n Capital expenditures are the next largest use of capital. Capital expenditures were 10 percent of total \nsales in 2015, moderately below the long-term average of 12 percent. This long-term average exceeds \nlevels in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and APEJ. A logical explanation for this gap is the composition of GEM \neconomies. (See Exhibit 58.) Capital-intensive industries such as energy, materials, and industrials \nrepresent a greater share of the economy in GEM than in any other region. \n \uf402\n R&D spending is very modest and remained in a narrow band of 0.3 to 0.5 percent of sales until recently. \nThat figure rose to 0.6 percent in 2014 and 0.8 percent in 2015. Despite the rise, this level is still well \nbelow that of the U.S., Japan, and Europe. Again, sector composition plays a key role, as GEM has a very \nlow concentration in information technology and healthcare, the most R&D-intensive sectors, and a high \nconcentration in industries that rely on capital investments for growth. Relative to the other regions, GEM \ncompanies also spend less on R&D.  \n \uf402\n Share buybacks have been a very minor use of capital. Buybacks have averaged just 0.4 percent of total \nmarket capitalization over time, which compares to dividends at 2.3 percent. BRIC countries in particular \nspend very little on buybacks. Buyback activity was extremely low until the mid-2000s, rose sharply in \n2007, then plummeted in the ensuing years. Dividends have been far more stable.  \n \nExhibit 58: GEM Sector Composition, 1992-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT.  \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nFinancials\nUtilities\nTelecom\nInformation Technology\nHealthcare\nConsumer Staples\nEnergy\nConsumer Discretionary\nIndustrials\nMaterials\n"

R&D has been in a narrow band of 0.3 to 0.5 percent of sales until recently. That figure \nrose to 0.6 percent in 2014 and 0.8 percent in 2015. A logical explanation for this increase is the changing \ncomposition of GEM economies. IT and healthcare, the most R&D-intensive sectors, were roughly 10 percent \nof total market capitalization in 2015, up from just 1 percent in the early 1990s.  \n \nDespite the rise, R&D spending as a fraction of sales is nevertheless well below that of the U.S., Japan, and \nEurope, which are all slightly above 2 percent. Sector composition also plays a key role. GEM still has a lower \nconcentration in information technology and healthcare compared to the other regions, and a higher \nconcentration in industries that rely more heavily on capital investments.  \n \nIn GEM countries, businesses account for 44 percent of total R&D spending on average, with the government, \nacademia, and private nonprofit companies spending the other 56 percent.59 Corporations in GEM account for \na smaller share of the total R&D spending than they do in the U.S. and Japan (70-80 percent), Europe (about \n60 percent), and APEJ (roughly 50 percent).    \n \nAmong larger GEM economies, the business share of R&D spending is 77 percent in China, 60 percent in \nRussia, 39 percent in Mexico, and 35 percent in India. The business share of R&D spending is particularly low \nin Latin American countries at 30 percent on average. One notable change is in China, where the corporate \nshare of R&D spending has risen from just 43 percent in 1996 to 77 percent today as the country continues \nto move toward a more market-based economy.  \n \n \n \n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n0\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n200,000\n250,000\n300,000\n350,000\n400,000\n450,000\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nAs a percentage of net sales\n$ Millions\nDollar amount\nAs a percentage of sales\n"

First, you want to study how a company has allocated capital in the \npast. Next, you need to examine the company\u2019s return on invested capital and, more importantly, return on \nincremental invested capital. Third is a careful consideration of incentives and corporate governance. And  \nfinally, you can compare management\u2019s actions to the five principles of capital allocation. You can find a more \ndetailed version of this discussion in Michael J. Mauboussin, Dan Callahan, and Darius Majd, \u201cCapital \nAllocation: Evidence, Analytical Methods, and Assessment Guidance,\u201d Credit Suisse Global Financial \nStrategies, October 19, 2016. \n \nPast Spending Patterns. The first step in assessing a company\u2019s capital allocation skills is to see how \nmanagement has allocated capital in the past. You should break the analysis into two parts, one dealing with \ninvestments in the operations (M&A, capital expenditures, R&D, and working capital) and the other with \nreturning cash to claimholders (dividends, buybacks, and debt repayment).  \n \nThe value of a business is the present value of future free cash flow (FCF).61 Free cash flow is defined as net \noperating profit after tax (NOPAT), a measure of the cash earnings of the business that assumes no financial \nleverage, minus investment (I) in future growth: \n \nFCF = NOPAT \u2013 I \n \nNOPAT is determined by sales and sales growth, operating profit margins, and the cash tax rate. Investment \n(I) is determined by changes in working capital, capital expenditures net of depreciation, and acquisitions net \nof divestitures. The product of this analysis is a clear understanding of profitability (sales, sales growth, and \noperating profit margins) and the investment choices the company has made (changes in working capital, \ncapital expenditures, and M&A).   \n \nSuch an examination is also useful to assess the change in practices from one CEO to the next. One CEO \nmay seek to grow primarily organically, which will raise one set of analytical issues. Another may focus on \nprofitability and emphasize cost cutting. Yet another may be more acquisitive, raising a separate set of issues. \nAssuming past behaviors provide some basis for anticipating future behavior, this analysis is very useful. \n \nThe second component of this analysis is to understand how and why management has returned cash to \nclaimholders. This also requires considering a company\u2019s capital structure and whether it can or should \nchange. The key is to understand the rationale and motivation for the decisions management makes to \nunderstand whether they are consistent with the principles of building long-term value per share.     \n \nCalculating Return on Invested Capital and Return on Incremental Invested Capital. The second \ncomponent to assessing capital allocation is determining the output of management\u2019s decisions through an \nanalysis of return on invested capital (ROIC) and return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC). ROIC provides \na picture of the company\u2019s overall performance while ROIIC dwells on the efficiency of incremental spending. \nOur report, \u201cCalculating Return on Invested Capital: How to Determine ROIC and Address Common Issues,\u201d \nprovides details on how to calculate ROIC and ROIIC and includes case studies.62 Here\u2019s a quick summary.  \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n67 \nNOPAT is the numerator of ROIC. Because NOPAT assumes no financial leverage, the sum is the same \nwhether a company is highly levered or free of debt. This is essential for comparability within and across \nindustries. \n \nInvested capital is the denominator of ROIC. You can think of invested capital in two ways that are equivalent. \nFirst, it\u2019s the amount of net assets a company needs to run its business. Alternatively, it\u2019s the amount of \nfinancing a company\u2019s creditors and shareholders need to supply to fund those net assets. These approaches \nare the same since dual-entry accounting requires that both sides of the balance sheet equal one another.  \n \nYou can evaluate ROIC a number of ways. First and most fundamentally, companies that create value \ngenerate an ROIC above the cost of capital over time. This simply says that the company is earning in excess \nof the opportunity cost of capital. Second is the magnitude of the spread between ROIC and the cost of \ncapital as well as how much a company can invest at a given spread. Companies with wide spreads that have \nlimited investment opportunity may be less valuable than companies with narrower spreads but ample growth \nprospects.  \n \nHaving defined and discussed ROIC, we must now emphasize that it\u2019s not the absolute ROIC that matters but \nrather the change in ROIC. Or, even more accurately, what\u2019s crucial is the expectation for changes in ROIC. \nNeedless to say, the market is not always perfect at anticipating change in ROIC, so having a sense of where \nROIC is going can be of great value.63 \n \nOne potentially useful measure is return on incremental invested capital, or ROIIC. ROIIC properly recognizes \nthat sunk costs are irrelevant and that what matters is the relationship between incremental earnings and \nincremental investments.  \n \nThe definition of ROIIC is as follows:  \n \nROIIC =  \n          ____Year2 NOPAT \u2013 Year1 NOPAT________               \n                             Year1 invested capital \u2013 Year0 invested capital  \n \nIn words, ROIIC compares the change in NOPAT in a given year to the investments made in the prior year. \nLet\u2019s say a company\u2019s Year0 invested capital is $2,000 and it invests $200 during the year (making Year1 \ninvested capital $2,200). Further, NOPAT from Year1 to Year2 climbs from $300 to $350. Given these \nassumptions, ROIIC is 25 percent [($350-300)/($2,200-2,000)].  \n \nIt is preferable to calculate ROIIC on a rolling three- or five-year basis for businesses with investments or \nNOPAT that are lumpy. At the other extreme, you can take quarterly changes and annualize them if you want \nto see if there are any recent trends or improvements. Obviously these results will be the most volatile, but \nthey can give you some insights into how the business is doing.  \n \nIncentives and Corporate Governance. One of the essential lessons of economics is that incentives matter. \nBut it is also the case that incentives designed to achieve one objective can lead to unintended \nconsequences.64 The goal of this section is to consider whether the incentives a company has in place \nencourage judicious capital allocation. Most of these incentives address compensation.  \n \nAgency theory is the classic way to explain why the managers of a company may not act in the interests of the \nshareholders.65 The idea is that conflicts can arise when there is a separation between ownership and control \nof a firm. There are three areas where these conflicts tend to arise.66   \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n68 \nThe first is that while it is clear that shareholders want management to maximize the value of their holdings, \nmanagement may derive benefits from controlling resources that don\u2019t enrich shareholders. For example, if \nremuneration is roughly correlated with the size of the firm, management may seek to do value-destroying \nM&A deals to grow.  \n \nThe second area of conflict is with tolerance for risk. Since shareholders tend to hold stocks as part of a \ndiversified portfolio and managers are disproportionately exposed to their own company, managers may seek \nless risk than shareholders would deem appropriate.  \n \nThe final conflict is with time horizon. To the degree that compensation plans have a shorter time horizon than \nthe period shareholders use to assess the merit of an investment, there can be a mismatch. So managers may \ndwell on short-term boosts in earnings. Indeed, research shows that a large majority of managers are willing to \nforego value-creating investments to deliver near-term earnings.67  \n \nSo what elements should you look for in an effective incentive program? The key is to look for a company that \nseeks to build long-term value per share with the belief that the stock market will ultimately follow that value. If \nthe market fails to reflect that value, management can take action by sharpening communication or buying \nback stock.   \n \nThere are three elements to an incentive compensation program that supports judicious capital allocation.68 \nThe first is to compensate senior executives with stock options or restricted stock units that are indexed to \neither the market overall or an appropriate peer group. Presuming that exogenous factors affect peers in a \nsimilar fashion as the target firm, indexing takes a large step toward isolating management skill and reducing \nthe role of luck. Only individuals who can influence the stock price should be paid in equity, which limits the \nnumber of eligible executives.  \n \nSecond, executives who run operating units, as well as front line employees, should be paid for exceeding \nlong-term goals for the operating value drivers. These include sales growth, operating profit margins, and \nsome measure of return on invested capital. Broader value drivers can be further broken down into leading \nindicators of value, performance measures that roll up to the value drivers.  \nFinally, recognize that the debate about the short term versus the long term is an empty one.69 Instead, \nacknowledge that the goal is to maximize long-term value per share. This applies to activities that \nmanagement expects to pay off quickly or in the distant future.70  \n \nFive Principles of Capital Allocation. In their book, The Value Imperative, James McTaggart, Peter Kontes, \nand Michael Mankins describe four principles of resource allocation that apply readily to our discussion about \ncapital allocation.71 We added one to expand the list to five and believe that these principles are a sound \nbenchmark that you can use to measure management\u2019s mindset regarding their capital allocation practices.72  \n  \n1. Zero-based capital allocation. Companies generally think about capital allocation on an incremental \nbasis. For example, a study of more than 1,600 U.S. companies by McKinsey & Company, a global \nconsulting firm, found that there was a 0.92 correlation between how much capital a business unit \nreceived in one year and the next. For one-third of the companies, that correlation was 0.99.73 In other \nwords, inertia appears to play a large role in capital allocation.  \n \nThe proper approach is zero-based, which simply asks, \u201cWhat is the right amount of capital (and the right \nnumber of people) to have in this business to support the strategy that will create the most wealth?\u201d74 \nThere is no reference to how much the company has already invested in the business, only how much \nshould be invested.  \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n69 \nResearch by McKinsey suggests that those companies that showed a zero-based allocation mindset, and \nhence were the most proactive in reallocating resources, delivered higher TSRs than the companies that \ntook more of an incremental approach.75 Further, academic research shows that those companies that are \ngood at internal capital allocation tend to be good at external allocation as well.76     \n \n2. Fund strategies, not projects. The idea here is that capital allocation is not about assessing and \napproving projects, but rather assessing and approving strategies and determining the projects that \nsupport the strategies. Practitioners and academics sometimes fail to make this vital distinction.77 There \ncan be value-creating projects within a failed strategy, and value-destroying projects within a solid strategy.  \n \nAnother reason to be cautious about a project approach is that it is easy to game the system. It is \ncommon for companies to have thresholds for project approval. For instance, a plant manager can \napprove small projects, business unit heads larger ones, the CEO bigger ones still, and the board of \ndirectors the largest investments. But at each level, analysts can manipulate the numbers to look good. \nOne of the aspects of the institutional imperative, as Buffett describes it, is, \u201cAny business craving of the \nleader, however foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared \nby his troops.\u201d78 \n \nThe key to this principle is recognizing that a business strategy is a bundle of projects and that the value of \nthe bundle is what matters. The CEO and board must evaluate alternative strategies and consider the \nfinancial prospects of each.   \n \n3. No capital rationing. The attitude at many companies, which the results of surveys support, is that \ncapital is \u201cscarce but free.\u201d The sense is that the business generates a limited amount of capital which \nmakes it \u201cscarce,\u201d but since it comes from within it is \u201cfree.\u201d   \n \nThe primary source of capital for companies in the U.S. is the cash they generate. The patterns of \nspending on the various uses of capital indicate the attitude of managements. Capital expenditures, R&D, \nand dividends receive priority, and M&A and share buybacks are considered when economic results are \ngood. Internal capital allocation tends to be very stable from year to year, and inertia plays a large role. \nBusiness units may jockey for more capital but, as we have seen, the changes in year-to-year allocation \ntend to be modest. These observations are consistent with the \u201cscarce but free\u201d mindset. \n \nA better mindset is that capital is plentiful but expensive. There are two sources of capital companies can \ntap beyond the cash generated internally. The first is redeploying capital from businesses that do not earn \nsufficient returns. Management can execute this inside the company or sell the underperforming \nbusinesses and redeploy the proceeds. The second is the capital markets. When executives have value-\ncreating strategies that need capital, the markets are there to fund them in all but the most challenging \nenvironments.    \n \nThe notion that internally generated capital is free is also problematic. Thoughtful capital allocators \nrecognize that all capital has an opportunity cost, whether the source is internal or external. As a \nconsequence, managers should explicitly account for the cost of capital in all capital allocation decisions. \nToo frequently, companies select actions that add to earnings or earnings per share without properly \nreckoning for value. \n \nThe limiting resource for many companies is not access to capital but rather access to talent. Finding \nexecutives with the proper skills for success, including an aptitude for allocating capital, is not easy. This is \na valid challenge but relates to recruiting and development, not access to capital. \n"

      "text": " \n \nNovember 15, 2016 \n \nCapital Allocation Outside the U.S. \n70 \n4. Zero tolerance for bad growth. Companies that wish to grow will inevitably make investments that do \nnot pay off. The failure rate of new businesses and new products is high. Seeing an investment flop is no \nsin; indeed it is essential to the process of creating value. What is a sin, in our view, is remaining \ncommitted to a strategy that has no prospects to create value, hence draining human and financial \nresources. \n \nExecutives who follow this principle invest in innovation but are ruthless in cutting losses when they see \nthat a strategy is unlikely to pay off. Many companies have the opportunity to create substantial value by \nexiting businesses where they have no advantage. This reduces cross-subsidization within the organization \nand allows for the best managers to work for the businesses that create the most value.  \n \n5. Know the value of assets, and be ready to take action to create value. Intelligent capital allocation \nis similar to managing a portfolio of stocks in that it is very useful to have a sense of the difference, if any, \nbetween the value and price of each asset. This includes the value of the company and its stock price. \nNaturally, such analysis must include considerations such as taxes.  \n \nWith a ready sense of value and price, management should be prepared to take action to create value. \nSometimes that means acquiring, other times that means divesting, and frequently there are no clear gaps \nbetween value and price. As we have seen, managers tend to prefer to buy than to sell, even though the \nempirical record shows quite clearly that sellers fare better than buyers, on average. \n \nAs we mentioned in the introduction, the answer to most capital allocation questions is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d \nManagers who adhere to this final principle understand when it makes sense to act on behalf of long-term \nshareholders.  \n \nConclusion \n \nCapital allocation is one of management\u2019s prime responsibilities. Yet few senior executives are versed or \ntrained in methods to allocate capital most effectively. Further, incentive programs frequently encourage \nbehaviors that are not in the best interests of long-term shareholders. We believe that the goal of capital \nallocation is to build long-term value per share.  \n \nThis report had three parts. First we discussed the sources and uses of capital at a high level. In general, \ncountries or regions with high returns on invested capital are in a position to fund a substantial percentage of \ninvestment. We also noted the differences for the major regions of the world. The differences reflect the \nnature of the underlying economy, stage of development, cultural norms, and regulations.  \n \nThe second part examined the sources and uses of capital for Japan, Europe, Asia/Pacific excluding Japan, \nand Global Emerging Markets. The patterns in the U.S. and Europe are similar, with relatively strong spending \non R&D, solid capital expenditure levels, active M&A, and a relatively generous shareholder yield.79 The CFROI \nin the U.S. is substantially higher. Japan has a low CFROI and relatively modest growth. M&A is also muted, \nand shareholder yield is low\u2014although there has been improvement in recent years. Developing markets \nspend an above-average amount on capital expenditures and working capital. But they have low shareholder  \nyields and allocate little to R&D.  \n \nFinally, we set out a framework to assess the capital allocation practices of a management team. This \nframework includes examining past behavior, calculating return on invested capital, weighing incentives, and \nconsidering the five principles of thoughtful capital allocation. \n"

In the 1960s, in \u201cA Modest Proposal,\u201d I suggested that companies should be \nrequired to pay out 100% of their net income as cash dividends. If companies needed money to reinvest in \ntheir operations, then they would have to get investors to buy new offerings of stock. Investors would do that \nonly if they were happy both with the dividends they\u2019d received and the future prospects of the company. \nMarkets as a whole know more than any individual or group of individuals. So the best way to allocate capital \nis to let the market do it, rather than the management of each company. The reinvestment of profits has to be \nsubmitted to the test of the marketplace if you want it to be done right.  \nFor academic research supporting this point, see Jeffrey Wurgler, \u201cFinancial Markets and the Allocation of \nCapital,\u201d Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 58, Nos. 1-2, 2000, 187-214.  \n11 Michael J.

Translated literally, keiretsu means headless \ncombine. But as a form of corporate structure, it consisted of interlocking share ownership between Japanese \ncompanies, especially between banks and their corporate clients.

It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary \nquantitative algorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all \nthe companies included in its database. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default \nvariables and incorporated into the algorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and \nearnings data provided by outside data vendors are subject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying \neconomics of firm performance. These adjustments provide consistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies \nacross industries or national borders. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline \nvaluation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce alternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional \ninformation about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request. \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT \nvaluation model establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default \nvariables may also be adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur.
