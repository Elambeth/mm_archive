The problem is that many CEOs, while almost universally well intentioned, don\u2019t know how to \nallocate capital effectively. The proper goal of capital allocation is to build long-term value per share. The \nemphasis is on building value and letting the stock market reflect that value. Companies that dwell on \nboosting their short-term stock price frequently make decisions that are at odds with building value.  \n \uf402\n Capital allocation is always important but is especially pertinent in the United States today given the high \nreturn on invested capital, modest growth, and substantial cash on corporate balance sheets. Companies \nthat deploy capital judiciously have a significant opportunity to build value.  \n \uf402\n Internal financing represented more than 90 percent of the source of total capital for U.S. companies from \n1980-2015. This is a higher percentage than that of other developed countries including the United \nKingdom, Germany, France, and Japan.  \n \uf402\n Mergers and acquisitions (M&A), capital expenditures, and research and development (R&D) are the \nlargest uses of capital for operations. In the past 35 years, capital expenditures are down, and R&D is up, \nas a percentage of sales. This reflects a shift in the underlying economy. M&A is the largest use of capital \nbut follows the stock market closely. More deals happen when the stock market is up.    \n \uf402\n The amount companies have spent on buybacks has exceeded dividends for the past decade, except for \n2009. Buybacks did not become relevant in the U.S. until 1982, so you should treat comparisons of \nyields before and after 1982 with caution. Research shows that the overall proclivity to return cash has not \nchanged much over the decades, but the means by which the payout occurs has shifted. \n \uf402\n Academic research shows that rapid asset growth is associated with poor total shareholder returns. \nFurther, companies that contract their assets often create substantial value per share. Ultimately, the \nanswer to all capital allocation questions is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d Most actions are either foolish or smart based on \nthe price and value.  \n \uf402\n Divestitures are substantial and generally create value. If the buyers tend to lose value, it stands to reason \nthat the sellers gain value. Selling or spinning off poor performing businesses can lead to addition by \nsubtraction. \n \uf402\n Past spending patterns are often a good starting point for assessing future spending plans. Once you \nknow how a company spends money, you can dig deeper into management\u2019s decision-making process. \nFurther, it is useful to calculate return on invested capital and return on incremental invested capital. \nThese metrics can provide a sense of the absolute and relative effectiveness of management\u2019s spending. \n \uf402\n Understanding incentives for management is crucial. Assess the degree to which management is focused \non building value and addressing agency costs. \n \uf402\n The five principles of value creation include: zero-based capital allocation; fund strategies, not projects; no \ncapital rationing; zero tolerance for bad growth; and know the value of assets and be prepared to take \naction.    \n \n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n4 \nIntroduction \n \nCapital allocation is the most fundamental responsibility of a senior management team of a public corporation. \nSuccessful capital allocation means converting inputs, including money, things, ideas, and people, into \nsomething more valuable than they would be otherwise. The net present value (NPV) test is a simple, \nappropriate, and classic way to determine whether management is living up to this responsibility. Passing the \nNPV test means that $1 invested in the business is worth more than $1 in the market. This occurs when the \npresent value of the long-term cash flow from an investment exceeds the initial cost. \n \nWhy should value determine whether a management team is living up to its responsibility? There are two \nreasons. The first is that companies must compete. A company that is allocating its resources wisely will \nultimately prevail over a competitor that is allocating its resources foolishly. The second is that inputs have an \nopportunity cost, or the value of the next best alternative. Unless an input is going to its best and highest use, \nit is underperforming relative to its opportunity cost. \n \nThe process of making inputs more valuable has a number of aspects. A logical starting point is a strategy. \nProperly conceived, a strategy requires a company to specify the trade-offs it will make to establish a position \nin the marketplace that creates value. A strategy also requires a company to align its activities with its \npositioning and to execute effectively.1   \n \nSince a company\u2019s strategy is often already in place when a new chief executive officer (CEO) takes over, \ncapital allocation generally becomes his or her main responsibility. While a proper and comprehensive \ndiscussion of capital allocation requires a consideration of intangible and human resources, our focus here is \non how companies spend money.  \n \nThe problem is that many CEOs, while almost universally well intentioned, don\u2019t know how to allocate capital \neffectively. Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, describes this reality in his 1987 letter \nto shareholders. He discusses the point of why it is beneficial for Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s corporate office to \nallocate the capital of the companies it controls. Buffett is worth quoting at length:2  \nThis point can be important because the heads of many companies are not skilled in capital \nallocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising. Most bosses rise to the top because they have excelled \nin an area such as marketing, production, engineering, administration or, sometimes, institutional \npolitics.  \nOnce they become CEOs, they face new responsibilities. They now must make capital allocation \ndecisions, a critical job that they may have never tackled and that is not easily mastered. To stretch \nthe point, it\u2019s as if the final step for a highly-talented musician was not to perform at Carnegie Hall but, \ninstead, to be named Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  \nThe lack of skill that many CEOs have at capital allocation is no small matter: After ten years on the \njob, a CEO whose company annually retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth will have been \nresponsible for the deployment of more than 60% of all the capital at work in the business.  \nCEOs who recognize their lack of capital-allocation skills (which not all do) will often try to compensate \nby turning to their staffs, management consultants, or investment bankers. Charlie [Munger] and I \nhave frequently observed the consequences of such \u201chelp.\u201d On balance, we feel it is more likely to \naccentuate the capital-allocation problem than to solve it.  \nIn the end, plenty of unintelligent capital allocation takes place in corporate America. (That's why you \nhear so much about \u201crestructuring.\u201d) \n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n5 \nIntelligent capital allocation requires understanding the long-term value of an array of opportunities and \nspending money accordingly. It also includes knowing the value of a firm\u2019s individual assets and being willing \nto sell them when they are worth more to others.  \n \nWe believe that long-term growth in value per share should guide capital allocation decisions. A necessary \ncorollary is that there is a time when shrinking the business is the most beneficial course for ongoing \nshareholders. In some cases, for instance, buying back shares is a wiser choice than expanding by means of \ncapital expenditures or acquisition.  \n \nCapital allocation is a dynamic process, so the correct answer to most questions is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d Sometimes \nacquiring makes sense and other times divesting is the better alternative. There are times to issue equity and \ntimes to retire it. Because the components that determine price and value are changing constantly, so too \nmust the assessments that a CEO makes. As Buffett says, \u201cThe first law of capital allocation\u2014whether the \nmoney is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases\u2014is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another.\u201d3 \n \nBuffett also discusses what he calls the \u201cinstitutional imperative,\u201d a force that is also pertinent.4 The force has \nmultiple aspects as he describes it, but a pair of them are relevant here. One is that subordinates will readily \ncreate spreadsheets and studies to support the business craving of the leader. Another is that companies will \n\u201cmindlessly\u201d imitate one another, whether in M&A or executive compensation.  \n \nThe message here should be clear. A decision isn\u2019t good just because someone in the organization can justify \nit or because some other company is doing it. Proper capital allocation requires a sharp analytical framework \nand independence of mind. \n \nIn our experience, very few CEOs, and chief financial officers for that matter, have what we call the \u201cNorth \nStar of value.\u201d The North Star is not the brightest star, but it doesn\u2019t move much throughout the night or year. \nAs a result, it provides a reliable sense of direction. Likewise, companies that have a North Star of value have \nan unwavering view of value no matter what is going on. It is common for executives to solicit input from a \nrange of stakeholders, hear varying points of view, and walk away confused and unsure about the proper \ncourse of action. This doesn\u2019t happen to executives with the North Star of value, especially since they may \nhave better information about their company\u2019s prospects than the market does. \n \nIncentives are another barrier to proper capital allocation. An executive who is paid to deliver a target based on \nshort-term earnings per share may well act very differently than an executive who is focused on building long-\nterm value per share. In assessing management, ask a fundamental question: If there is a conflict between \nmaximizing a reward based on the incentive plan and creating long-term value per share, which route will the \nexecutive select?  \n \nWilliam Thorndike\u2019s excellent book, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational \nBlueprint for Success, deeply inspired this report.5 Thorndike shares the stories of eight CEOs who created \ntremendous value per share during their tenures. One theme that comes out clearly in the book, and is explicit \nin the subtitle, is that these CEOs appeared out of step with conventional wisdom as they were building value. \nThe North Star of value guided their decisions, and they had the independence of mind to make the best \nchoices. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

It then specifies capital allocation \noptions, shows how companies have allocated capital in the past 35 years, and explains why this issue \nof capital allocation is particularly relevant today.  \n \n2. Capital allocation alternatives. This section documents how much money companies have allocated \nto each alternative over time, offers an analytical framework for judging value creation, summarizes the \nacademic research on the payoffs to such investments, and provides a brief outlook for spending.  \n \n3. Assessing a company\u2019s capital allocation skills. This part discusses methods to assess past \ncapital allocation choices, how to evaluate incentives, and the five principles of capital allocation.  \n \nGroundwork: Where Does the Money Come From and Where Has It Gone?  \n \nIf the job of management is to deploy capital so as to add value, it makes sense to start with a discussion of \nwhere capital comes from and how management teams have spent it in the past. The sources of capital \ninclude the cash the business generates and access to the capital of claimholders, including debtors and \nshareholders. A company can also sell an asset, which is a one-time realization of the cash flow the asset is \nexpected to generate over its life.   \n \nBusinesses that grow rapidly generally require a sizable amount of investment. For example, imagine a \nrestaurant concept that is highly successful. To satiate demand that firm must build lots of restaurants and \nhence invest a substantial sum in expansion. The rate of return on incremental capital is the maximum growth \nrate in operating profit a business can reach without external financing. By extension, a company with a return \non invested capital (ROIC) greater than its growth rate will generate surplus capital.6  \n   \nCompanies that cannot fund their growth internally must access cash externally, either by borrowing or selling \nequity. The pecking order theory is an idea in corporate finance that says that managers of companies will \ntypically choose to fund investments first with cash that the company generates internally, next with debt, and \nfinally with equity.7 One essential tenet of thoughtful capital allocation is that all capital has an opportunity cost, \nwhether the source is internal or external. \n \nThe uses of capital are where money goes. Executives can invest in the business through capital expenditures, \nincreases in working capital, research and development, or mergers and acquisitions. These investments allow \na company to grow. But growth, in and of itself, is never the goal of a thoughtful capital allocator. The proper \nmetric of success is an increase in long-term value per share. \n \nA company can also return cash to debt and equity holders. Debt repayment, a return of some or all principal \nand interest a company owes, is straightforward. A company can return cash to shareholders either by paying \na dividend, where all holders receive the same amount, or by buying back stock. In a buyback, shareholders \nsort themselves. Those who want cash sell their shares and those who want to increase their stake in the \ncompany hold their shares. A dividend treats all shareholders the same no matter what the stock price. \n  \nIn a buyback, selling shareholders benefit at the expense of ongoing shareholders if the stock is overvalued, \nand ongoing shareholders benefit at the expense of selling shareholders if the stock is undervalued. All \nshareholders are treated uniformly only if the stock price is at fair value.8  \n \n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n8 \nInternal financing represents a larger percentage of the total source of capital for companies in the U.S. than \nfor companies in other developed countries. For example, internal financing has been about 70 percent of the \ntotal source for the United Kingdom, 66 percent for Germany, 55 percent for France, and 50 percent for \nJapan.9 The ratio of internal financing to the total source of capital tends to correlate with the underlying return \non invested capital. A country with a high ROIC can fund a greater percentage of its investments with \ninternally generated cash than a country with a low ROIC. \n \nThere are pros and cons to having internal financing represent a high percentage of investment funding. The \npro is that companies are earning high returns on capital in general and need not rely on capital markets to \nfund their growth. The con is that companies can deploy internally generated funds into value-destroying \ninvestments. The need to raise money from the capital markets creates a check on management\u2019s spending \nplans.  \n \nIndeed, Peter Bernstein, the renowned financial historian and economist, once suggested that all companies \nshould be required to pay out 100 percent of their earnings and then appeal to the markets when they want \nfunds for investment. He argued that markets are more effective than companies at allocating capital, and as \na result the overall effectiveness of capital allocation would improve if left to the devices of the market.10    \n \nThe choice of debt or equity as a source of funding also determines capital structure. Exhibit 3 shows the \ndebt-to-total capital ratio for the largest companies in the U.S. from 1950 through 2015. We define the debt-\nto-total capital ratio as the book value of debt divided by the sum of the book value of debt and the market \nvalue of equity. The ratio is currently 19 percent, just below the long-term average of about 20 percent. The \navailability and cost of debt, along with the appetite for debt and the general level of stock prices, determine \nthis ratio. \n \nExhibit 3: U.S. Debt-to-Total Capital, 1950-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae.  \nNote: For data back to 1920, see John R.

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n10 \nSimilar to 2015, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and capital expenditures are the largest uses of capital over \ntime. An examination of the changes from 1980 through 2015 reveals some noteworthy patterns: \n \uf402\n M&A is by far the largest use of capital, but it is very cyclical, ranging from a low of less than 1 percent of \nsales in 1980 to almost 30 percent at its peak in the late 1990s. M&A activity tends to be greatest when \nthe economy is doing well, the stock market is up, and access to capital is easy. As a result, companies \nfrequently do deals when they can, rather than when they should. \n \uf402\n Capital expenditures went from roughly 10 percent of sales to approximately 6 percent over this period. \nThe simplest explanation is that the composition of the economy has changed, with businesses that \nrequire less capital investment replacing those that require more. (See Exhibits 6 and 7.) For example, \nthe energy, materials, and industrial sectors represented 50 percent of the market capitalization of the \ntop 1,500 companies in the U.S. market in 1980 but just 19 percent in 2015. During the same time, the \nhealthcare and technology sectors went from 18 to 34 percent of the market capitalization. This shift also \nhelps explain the increase in cash holdings.11 Another possible cause of the dip in capital expenditures is \nthat public companies are now investing too little. Academic research suggests that public companies \ninvest less than comparable private companies because they want to maximize short-term earnings.12 \n \uf402\n Share buybacks went from being virtually nonexistent in 1980 to a large use of capital in the last decade. \nIn 1982, the Securities and Exchange Commission defined rules that created a safe harbor for \ncompanies to repurchase shares, eliminating the threat of stock manipulation and opening the floodgates \nfor buybacks. Over the past 30 years, companies have shifted their payouts from mostly dividends to a \ncombination of dividends and buybacks. Research shows that the propensity to distribute cash to \nshareholders has held remarkably steady after accounting for firm characteristics including size, age, and \nprofitability.13 \n \uf402\n Research and development (R&D) expenditures have risen steadily, growing from 1.3 percent of sales in \n1980 to 2.7 percent in 2015. The shift in the composition of the economy that accounts for the decline \nin capital expenditures also explains the rise in R&D (see Exhibits 6 and 8). Further, companies that rely \non R&D tend to hold more cash than companies that are less reliant on R&D. This partially accounts for \nthe swell of cash on corporate balance sheets.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Larry Fink, the chairman and \nCEO of BlackRock, Inc., an investment firm with more than $5.1 trillion in assets under management, \ncaptured the current zeitgeist in a letter dated February 1, 2016. Addressed to the leaders of large global \ncorporations, the letter argued that many companies are shying away from investments with long-term payoffs \nin favor of returning cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. In effect, Fink argued that the chiefs of \nindustry are misallocating capital.14 \n \nLet\u2019s turn to some concepts and numbers to quantify Fink\u2019s assertion. The maximum earnings growth rate a \ncompany can achieve through internal funding is a function of its ROIC and payout ratio. High ROICs and low \npayout ratios allow for greater achievable growth rates than low ROICs and high payout ratios. Low ROIC or \nhigh payout businesses can certainly grow but need to access debt or equity capital to do so. \n \nHere are the numbers. Cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae\uf02a) remains high in the U.S. (see Exhibit 11). \nCFROI measures the cash returns a business earns on the investments it makes. Since CFROI is also \nadjusted for inflation, it is an ideal tool for comparing results over time. The current level of 9.2 percent is well \nabove the historical average of approximately 6.6 percent from 1951-2015. The number is even higher \nexcluding the excess cash parked on the balance sheets of many companies. The current levels of ROIC and \nCFROI suggest that companies today can fund substantial growth through internally-generated funds.   \n \nExhibit 11: U.S. CFROI, 1951-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT.  \nNote: U.S. industrial firms, weighted by net assets. \n \n                                                 \n \n\uf02a CFROI\n\u00ae is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding the United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse \nGroup AG or its affiliates. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n1951\n1955\n1959\n1963\n1967\n1971\n1975\n1979\n1983\n1987\n1991\n1995\n1999\n2003\n2007\n2011\n2015\nPercent\nAverage\n"

In 2015, spending \nwas very weak relative to the long-term average, a point that is particularly pronounced given that CFROIs are \nhigh. It\u2019s hard to know exactly why companies remain so reticent to invest, but executives commonly point to \npolitical and economic uncertainty.15 \n \nExhibit 12: U.S. Real Asset Growth Rate, 1951-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT.  \nNote: U.S. industrial firms, weighted by gross investments. \n \nThe combination of high return on investment and modest growth means that businesses are generating \nsizable sums of cash. For example, companies in the S&P 500, excluding the financial services, transportation, \nand utilities industries, had a balance of cash and marketable securities of $1.4 trillion as of June 30, 2016, \nroughly 8 percent of the market capitalization of the index. This cash balance is even more remarkable \nconsidering that companies in the S&P 500 disbursed $975 billion to their shareholders through buybacks \nand dividends in the 12 months ending June 30, 2016.  \n \nCash balances are high today, and it is common to hear market commentators say that we are at all-time \nhighs. But we are by no means in uncharted waters if you measure cash as a percentage of assets. Exhibit 13 \nshows that at 11 percent, today\u2019s cash as a percentage of assets is well below the levels in the post-World \nWar II period. Further, a sizable sum of today\u2019s cash balance is offshore, and companies cannot repatriate it \nwithout incurring an additional tax burden. So between the shift in the composition of the economy and tax \npolicy, some increase in cash holdings should come as no surprise.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n1951\n1955\n1959\n1963\n1967\n1971\n1975\n1979\n1983\n1987\n1991\n1995\n1999\n2003\n2007\n2011\n2015\nPercent\nAverage\n"

Internal \nfinancing supplies less capital to companies in other developed countries, in part because those countries \nhave lower ROICs. \n \uf402\n The primary uses of capital include M&A and capital expenditures, although M&A is very cyclical. Over \nthe last 35 years spending on capital expenditures and dividends has declined as a percentage of sales, \nwhile R&D and share buybacks have increased as a percentage of sales. These changes reflect the shift \nin the structure of the underlying economy. \n \uf402\n ROIC is high in the U.S., and the rate of investment is middling. As a consequence, companies are \ngenerating strong free cash flow, and capital allocation is more important than ever. \n \nBefore delving into each of the specific uses of capital, it is worth considering what the academic research \nsays about capital allocation. The findings are easy to condense: \u201cAsset growth rates are strong predictors of \nfuture abnormal returns.\u201d This is true in both U.S. and international markets.16  \n \nMore specifically, firms with low asset growth rates earn substantially higher shareholder returns, after \nadjusting for risk, than firms with high asset growth rates. Further, companies that contract their assets tend \nto generate higher shareholder returns than companies that expand their assets.  \n \nHigh returns to shareholders tend to follow events such as spin-offs, dividend initiations, share buybacks, and \ndebt prepayments, whereas low returns to shareholders generally follow events such as acquisitions and stock \nand debt issuance. \n \nThe academic research supports the notion that capital allocation is challenging and that growth is not \ninherently good. But we must keep in mind that context is very important. Recall that the correct answer to \nalmost every capital allocation question is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d We need to look beyond base rates, as informative as \nthey are, to understand what truly drives or impedes value creation. We now turn to the details of the major \nuses of capital.  \n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n1950\n1955\n1960\n1965\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\nAverage\n"

M&A is by far the largest source of redistribution of corporate resources of all \nthe alternatives. For many companies, M&A is the most significant means to pursue strategic goals and the \nmost costly way to do so. And if M&A volume continues to average 9 percent of the equity market \ncapitalization of the U.S., as it has since 1980, nearly all companies and investment portfolios will feel the \neffect of M&A at some point.       \n \nExhibit 14 shows the dollar amount of M&A as well as M&A as a percentage of sales from 1980 to 2015. \nM&A tends to follow the stock market closely, with more M&A activity when the stock market is up.17 It comes \nas no surprise that companies that act early in an M&A cycle tend to generate higher returns than those that \nact later. The first movers in an M&A wave enjoy the benefits of a larger pool of acquisition targets and \ncheaper valuations than companies that acquire later in the cycle. Later acquirers are encouraged to act based \non bandwagon effects, or what Buffett calls the institutional imperative, and an accommodating environment \nfor financing.18    \n \nExhibit 14: U.S. Mergers and Acquisitions, 1980-2015 \n \nSource: Thomson Reuters and Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: Dollar amounts are not inflated. U.S. announced domestic mergers; excludes debt tender offers, equity carve-outs, exchange offers, loan \nmodifications, and open market repurchases. \n \nPrivate equity has also played an increasingly prominent role in M&A (see Exhibit 15).

Mark Sirower, a consultant at Deloitte, suggests \nthat acquirers use the following formula:19 \n \nNet present value of the deal = present value of the synergies \u2013 premium \n \nSimply stated, the formula says that a deal is good if the acquirer gets more than it pays for. The underlying \npremise is that the target\u2019s stock price, pre-deal, accurately reflects the present value of the company\u2019s future \nfree cash flow. So the deal creates value for the buyer only if the synergy from putting the businesses \ntogether exceeds the premium for control the acquirer must pay to close the deal. This equation is more \nfundamental than superficial metrics such as accretion to earnings per share, which doesn\u2019t appear to factor \ninto the market\u2019s reaction.20 As a result, the formula provides much more insight into a deal\u2019s economic virtue.   \n \nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the terms in the equation. Exhibit 16 shows the results of a survey of corporate \nexecutives that McKinsey, a consulting firm, conducted regarding synergy.

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n21 \nAny analysis of M&A should focus on the difference between the synergy and the premium. Succeeding at \nM&A is not easy for a number of reasons. First, if the premium is too large a company cannot recoup its \ninvestment, no matter how strategic the deal. Second, often competitors can replicate the benefits of a deal or \ntake advantage of a company\u2019s lack of focus as it goes through an integration process. Third, M&A requires \npayment up front for benefits down the road, which creates legitimate skepticism for investors. Finally, M&A \ndeals are generally costly to reverse.23   \n \nThe empirical evidence on M&A underscores the challenges that buyers face.24 Over time, it appears that a \nmajority of acquirers see their stock prices decline following the announcement of a deal. Research by \nMcKinsey concluded that about one-third of deals create value for acquirers, and the other two-thirds are \nvalue neutral or value destructive.25 That said, you must recognize that M&A creates value when you consider \nboth the buyer and the seller. Exhibit 18 shows a measure that McKinsey calls \u201cdeal value added,\u201d which is \nthe percentage increase in the combined market capitalizations of the buyer and seller. This has averaged \nabout 6 percent over the past 19 years, with the only negative year in 2000 at the peak of the dot-com \nbubble. M&A creates substantial value but most of that value goes to the sellers, not the buyers.  \n \nExhibit 18: Average Deal Value Added, 1997-2015 \n \nSource: Richard Dobbs, Marc Goedhart, and Hannu Suonio, \u201cAre Companies Getting Better at M&A?\u201d McKinsey on Finance, Winter 2007, 7-11; \nDavid Cogman, \u201cGlobal M&A: Fewer Deals, Better Quality,\u201d McKinsey on Finance, Spring 2014, 23-25; David Cogman, McKinsey & Company. \nNote: DVA is McKinsey\u2019s calculation of the combined (acquirer and target) change in market capitalization relative to the market from two days prior to \ntwo days after the announcement, as a percentage of transaction value. \n \nOne comment we hear consistently from management is that the market is short-term oriented and fails to \nrecognize the virtue of the announced deal. Mark Sirower and his colleague, Sumit Sahni, studied this \nassertion. Exhibit 19 summarizes their findings, which are based on an analysis of more than 300 deals.26   \n \nThe first observation is that about one-third of the deals (103/302) result in a stock price for the buyer that is \ninitially higher, net of the market\u2019s change. This is consistent with past studies. Next, there is a clear \ncorrelation between the premium the buyer paid (the column on the right) and the announcement return (the \ncolumn in the middle). Smaller premiums yielded positive returns, and higher premiums generated negative \nreturns.

Mills, Masterminding the Deal: Breakthroughs in M&A Strategy and Analysis (London: Kogan Page, 2013), \n148-149. \n \nFor example, deals they call \u201copportunistic,\u201d where a weak competitor sells out, succeed at a rate of around \n90 percent. \u201cOperational\u201d deals, or cases where there are strong operational overlaps, also have an above-\naverage chance of success.

Finally, the success \nrate of \u201ctransformational\u201d deals, large leaps into different industries, tends to be very low.27   \n \nAnother factor that can work in favor of acquirers is the source of deal financing. The research suggests the \nmarket greets cash deals much more kindly than stock deals.28 There are a number of plausible explanations \nfor this. First, you can consider an acquisition funded with stock as two separate transactions: selling stock to \nthe public, and using the proceeds to buy the target. Management teams generally sell their stock when it\u2019s \nexpensive, providing a negative signal to the market. Second, in a cash transaction all of the deal\u2019s risk and \nreward accrues to the buyer. In a stock-for-stock deal, the buyer shares the risk with the seller. This, too, \nprovides a weaker signal of conviction.29    \n \nExhibit 21 shows the mix between all-cash deals and all-stock or blend deals. Cash deals are a much higher \npercentage of the total than a decade or so ago.

Dollar amounts are not inflated. \n \nWhat factors should you consider to judge whether capital expenditures create value? The industry is a good \nstarting point. Companies that invest in industries with a high return on invested capital and good growth \nprospects are more likely to create value. You can refine this analysis by considering whether the company \nhas a specific competitive advantage as a low-cost producer or through differentiation.31  \n \nThe cyclicality of the industry is another important consideration in assessing capital expenditures. Spending in \ncyclical industries tends to follow the same pattern as what we have seen in M&A and buybacks: companies \nspend when things look good and hunker down when they don\u2019t. As a consequence, companies tend to add \ntoo much capacity at the top of the cycle and suffer when the cycle recedes.  \n \nFinally, be mindful that relative comparisons of capital expenditures can be tricky. For example, analysts and \nexecutives generally compare the level of a company\u2019s spending to its peers. The retail industry is known for \nthis. The crucial question is not whether one company is spending more or less than another, but rather \nwhether a company is spending the proper amount.  \n \nThe relative game applies on the country level as well. For example, in the early 1990s there was a palpable \nfear that U.S. companies were investing too little relative to peer companies in countries such as Japan.32 \nWhat received less attention was the possibility that Japanese companies were investing too much and hence \nfailing to create value with many of their investments. We can make a similar distinction between public and \nprivate companies. The goal is not to spend more or less than the competitor but rather to spend the correct \namount given the economic opportunity at hand.    \n \nAcademic work on capital expenditures broadly supports the idea that the market rewards value creation and \nrefutes the idea that investors prefer short-term earnings gains at the expense of long-term value creation.33 \nThe research shows that the stock market rewards companies that invest in high-quality projects, which is \n0%\n1%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n5%\n6%\n7%\n0\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n200,000\n250,000\n300,000\n350,000\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\nAs a percentage of net sales\n$ Millions\nDollar amount\nAs a percentage of sales\n"

And for businesses with high economic returns, the \nmarket responds positively to unexpected increases in capital expenditures and negatively to unexpected \ndecreases in capital expenditures.34 \n \nBut there is also a limit to how rapidly a company can grow. Firms that increase their investments the most \ntend to suffer from poor relative total shareholder returns in the years following the growth.

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n30 \nOne approach to assess a company\u2019s R&D productivity is to capitalize R&D, amortize it over an appropriate \nperiod, and calculate the return on invested capital (ROIC) so as to be comparable to businesses that are not \nR&D intensive.37 R&D capitalization has the effect of increasing profit (the R&D amortization amount is almost \nalways less than expensed R&D, hence adding to profit) and increasing invested capital (since R&D is \nreclassified as a capital item rather than an expense). The challenge is to determine the appropriate \namortization period, or roughly the time to develop a product.  \n \nSome researchers who study the pharmaceutical industry assess R&D productivity by dividing a company\u2019s \nR&D budget over some period by the number of drugs the company has brought to market. Rather than \nexamining the cost of successful drugs only, this method captures the total costs a company incurs including \nthe cost of failure. Exhibit 27 shows the results of this analysis for the top 10 companies measured by R&D \ndollars spent per drug. A great deal has been written about the decline in R&D productivity in the \npharmaceutical industry, and attitudes about the virtue of R&D are at the crux of alternative strategies for \nvalue creation within the sector. 38  \n \nExhibit 27: R&D Cost per New Drug for 10 Large Pharmaceutical Companies \n \nSource: Matthew Herper, \u201cHow Much Does Pharmaceutical Innovation Cost? A Look at 100 Companies,\u201d Forbes, August 8, 2013.  \n \nThe academic research on the effectiveness of R&D spending is somewhat equivocal, in part because of the \nmeasurement challenges and the decline in R&D productivity in the pharmaceutical industry. One of the best \nways to study the market\u2019s reaction to any form of investment is to examine unexpected changes. In one such \nstudy, finance professors studied more than 8,000 unexpected increases in R&D spending over a 50-year \nperiod ended in 2001 and found that the stocks of those companies rose.39 Other researchers conclude that \nthe returns to R&D are positive and higher than other capital investments.40 \n \nA reasonable question is whether the stock market effectively reflects R&D spending. One large study found \nthat the market does it well. This means that companies that spend a large percentage of sales on R&D \nrealize similar stock market returns as companies that spend a small percentage of sales on R&D. The \nresearchers came to similar conclusions for advertising expenses, which are about one-half as large as R&D \nexpenses in the aggregate.41  \n \nAcademics have also found that larger companies that significantly increase their R&D expenditures tend to \nfare poorly in the stock market.42 That said, companies with strong execution capabilities can create value by \nenhancing R&D effectiveness.43 \n     \nSome recent research suggests that the technology companies that are in the bottom one-third of R&D \nspending as a percentage of sales deliver higher returns to shareholders than those in the top third.44 This \nCompany\nNumber of \nnew drugs\n1\nAbbott\n$13.2 billion\n1\n$13.2 billion\n2\nSanofi\n$60.8\n6\n$10.1\n3\nAstraZeneca\n$38.2\n4\n$9.6\n4\nHoffmann-La Roche\n$70.9\n8\n$8.9\n5\nPfizer\n$77.8\n10\n$7.8\n6\nWyeth\n$22.7\n3\n$7.6\n7\nEli Lilly\n$26.7\n4\n$6.7\n8\nBayer\n$33.1\n5\n$6.6\n9\nSchering-Plough\n$18.8\n3\n$6.3\n10\nNovartis\n$60.7\n10\n$6.1\n10-year R&D \nspending\nR&D per \ndrug\n"

She uses the vivid example of the iPhone from Apple \nInc., a company that has created a huge amount of shareholder value in the past decade. Four of the main \ntechnologies inside the iPhone, including the Global Positioning System (GPS), the Internet, touch screen, \nand voice recognition software, were developed by the U.S. government. As Mazzucato notes, Apple did a \nbrilliant job of integrating these technologies, designing an attractive and intuitive product, and marketing \neffectively. But it did not develop some of the key technologies inside the phone, which means the company\u2019s \nshareholders did not have to shoulder those expenses.   \n \nForecasters expect R&D spending to increase by about 3.5 percent in the U.S. and on a global basis in 2016. \nThe U.S., China, and Japan together represent more than half of global R&D spending, and ten countries \naccount for nearly 80 percent of the total. At current rates of funding and growth, China will surpass the U.S. \nas the largest spender on R&D in the year 2026. In the U.S., growth in R&D spending is expected for all \nindustries engaged in significant R&D activity. The greatest increases are expected in the information and \ncommunications technologies industry and the automotive and transportation systems industry, and the \nsmallest increase is seen in the life science industry.46   \n \nNet Working Capital. Net working capital is the capital a company requires to run its day-to-day operations. \nIt is defined as current assets minus non-interest-bearing current liabilities. Net working capital equals about \none-quarter of assets on average for companies in the U.S.47 The primary components of net working capital \ninclude inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Interest-bearing current liabilities, which include \nshort-term debt and the current maturities of long-term debt, are a form of financing and are therefore not \npart of net working capital. \n \nExhibit 28 shows the annual change in net working capital from 1980 through 2015. At the end of 2015, net \nworking capital stood at $1.9 trillion for the top 1,500 companies in the U.S., excluding the financial services \nand regulated utility industries. We consider changes in net working capital as opposed to the absolute \namount, because changes are what you should consider to be an incremental investment. Net working capital \ninvestments are substantially smaller than M&A, capital expenditures, or R&D. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The impact on total shareholder returns, however, is less clear. Research suggests that a \ndollar invested in working capital is worth less than a dollar either held in cash or invested in the firm. Further, \nextending credit to customers through increasing receivables has a bigger effect on shareholder value than \nincreasing inventory.51 \n \nThe main issue in the outlook for net working capital is what companies choose to do with their cash hoards. \nResearch shows that investors value cash on the balance sheet of companies with poor governance at $0.40-\n$0.90 on the dollar in anticipation of value-destroying moves.52 M&A continues to be a likely use of cash and, \nas we will see, companies continue to return cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends at a steady clip. \n \nDivestitures. Companies use divestitures to adjust their business portfolio. Actions include the sale of \ndivisions, spin-offs, and equity carve-outs.

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n36 \nThere are a few considerations in assessing divestitures. First, research has established that most of the value \ncreation for a typical company comes from a relatively small percentage of its assets.53 This means that most \ncompanies have businesses or assets that do not earn the cost of capital and that may be more valuable to \nanother owner.  \n \nDivestitures can lead to \u201caddition by subtraction\u201d when a company that divests an operation with a low return \non invested capital receives more than what the business is worth as an ongoing part of the firm. So there\u2019s \nan addition of value to the company even as there\u2019s a subtraction in the size of the firm. \n \nSecond, we have already reviewed the evidence showing that M&A creates value in the aggregate but that \nacquirers struggle to capture much, if any, of that value. This suggests it is better to be a seller than a buyer \non average. This point is particularly relevant when there are multiple bidders for an asset. Contested deals \nfrequently lead to what economists call the \u201cwinner\u2019s curse.\u201d54 When this occurs, the \u201cwinner\u201d of the bidding \npays too much for the asset, hence the \u201ccurse.\u201d The winner\u2019s curse means there is a wealth transfer, above \nand beyond the value of the asset, from the buyer to the seller. \n \nFinally, most companies have a natural tendency to want to grow rather than shrink. As companies grow and \ndiversify, capital allocation and strategic control can become more challenging. When a CEO who understands \ncapital allocation takes the helm of a company with underperforming assets, there is a great opportunity to \ncreate value through divestitures.55   \n \nNotwithstanding their significance in capital allocation, divestitures have received substantially less attention \nthan M&A in the academic literature. Research for the most part concludes that divestitures create value. A \nmeta-analysis of nearly 100 studies on divestitures concludes: \u201cIn the broadest possible terms, our results \nsuggest that on average, divestiture actions are associated with positive performance outcomes for the parent \nfirm.\u201d56 \n \nAnalysis also shows that spin-offs create value for the spin-offs themselves as well as the corporate parents.57 \nResearchers who did a meta-analysis of more than 25 papers in the spin-off literature summed up their \nfindings this way: \u201cThe main conclusion is consistent: spin-offs are associated with strongly significant \nabnormal returns.\u201d In 2016, the Bloomberg Spinoff Index is up more than twice as much as the S&P 500 \nIndex. Researchers suggest the factors that explain these wealth effects include sharpened focus, better \ninformation, and in some cases tax treatment.58 \n \nDivestitures remain active in 2016, reflecting the influence of activist investors and ongoing pressure for \ncompanies to create value. The number of spin-offs in 2016 is on pace with the 40 completed deals in \n2015.59 Similar to acquisitions, divestitures follow a wave with deals done at the peak of the cycle delivering \nlower returns for shareholders than those done at the beginning.60  \n \nDividends. A dividend is a cash payment to a shareholder that is generally paid from profits. Dividends and \nshare buybacks are the main ways companies return cash to shareholders. Companies can also return cash to \nshareholders by selling the company for cash. \n \nThe most profound difference between buybacks and dividends may be the attitude of executives. Most \nexecutives believe that once a dividend is established, paying it is on par with investment decisions such as \ncapital spending. In contrast, they tend to view buybacks as something to do with residual cash flow after the \ncompany has made all investments that are appropriate.61  \n \n \n"

First, dividends are useful to consider in the context of cash flow. To \nsustain a cash dividend, a company has to generate cash flow beyond the basic needs to maintain the \nbusiness and support its growth. So an investor should gauge a company\u2019s cash flow prospects in order to \nanticipate a company\u2019s ability to pay dividends.63    \n \nSecond, dividends can play an important role in the capital accumulation rate, also known as total shareholder \nreturn (TSR). From time to time you hear that dividends provide the bulk of shareholder returns for equities in \nthe long run. That assertion is wrong if you assume the goal of an investor is to accumulate capital. In fact, \nprice appreciation is the only source of investment return that increases accumulated capital over time.64 \n \nThe equity rate of return is a one-period measure and is simply the sum of stock price appreciation and the \ndividend. The capital accumulation rate, or TSR, is a multi-period measure that assumes all dividends are \nreinvested in the stock. Knowing price appreciation and dividend yield, the following equation allows you to \ncalculate TSR: \n \nTotal shareholder return (TSR) = Price appreciation + [(1 + price appreciation) * dividend yield] \n \nThe value of the compounding reinvested dividends means that the equity rate of return is always lower than \nthe TSR as long as price appreciation is positive. For example, assume price appreciation of 7 percent and a \ndividend yield of 2 percent. The equity rate of return is 9 percent (.07 + .02) and the TSR is 9.14 percent (.07 + \n[(1 + .07)*.02]).   \n \nThe key is that for an investor to actually earn the TSR, all of the dividends they receive must be reinvested back \ninto the stock. That\u2019s why price appreciation only determines the TSR.   \n \n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n1,800\n2,000\n2,200\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nS&P 500 Index\nDividends ($ billions)\nDividends\nS&P 500\n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n39 \nIt\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that almost no one earns the full TSR because most individuals do not reinvest the \ndividends they receive, and dividends are generally taxable. While there are no clear-cut data on the topic, it \nappears that only one-tenth of all dividend proceeds are reinvested. Naturally, investors can use dividends to \nconsume. But if they do, they can\u2019t earn the TSR. \n \nFurther, most investors must pay taxes on the dividends they receive. Exhibit 36 shows the top marginal tax \nrate on dividends and capital gains from 1960 to the present. The TSR declines when you assume that only a \nfraction is reinvested in the stock. Academic research supports the view that the tax rate on payouts affects \nshareholder returns.65 \n \nExhibit 36: U.S. Top Marginal Tax Rate, 1960-2016 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT and the Tax Foundation. \n \nFinally, investors in the U.S. should recognize that many of the mature, cash-rich companies that are excellent \ncandidates for paying a healthy dividend generate a high percentage of their profits outside the U.S. The \ncompanies cannot repatriate this cash to the U.S. without incurring additional taxes. There are a number of \nU.S. multinationals that do not have enough domestic cash to pay their dividends, even though their balance \nsheets are flush. A number of these businesses simply borrow in the U.S. to fund their dividends.66    \n \nAcademic research on dividends supports a few points. To begin, older companies are more likely to pay \ndividends than younger companies. So any analysis of dividend yields must take into account the maturity of \nthe population of companies under consideration.67      \n \nSecond, dividends provide a strong signal about management\u2019s commitment to distribute cash to shareholders \nand its confidence in the future earnings of the business. This is consistent with the managerial attitude that \ndividends are sacrosanct once declared. For this reason, companies are very deliberate about the decision to \ninitiate a dividend.68  \n \nDividends maintain steady, if modest growth. For example, dividends for the companies in the S&P 500 \ntotaled roughly $390 billion over the 12 months ending June 30, 2016, up 5% over the preceding 12 \nmonths.69 But an assessment of payout policy is not complete without considering share buybacks. \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1960\n1964\n1968\n1972\n1976\n1980\n1984\n1988\n1992\n1996\n2000\n2004\n2008\n2012\n2016\nCapital Gains\nDividends\n"

Buybacks were very scarce prior to that date because the Securities \nand Exchange Act of 1934 prohibited the manipulation of securities prices. Since the rules weren\u2019t clear about \nwhat constituted manipulation, most companies avoided buybacks altogether.71 \n \nIn 1982, Congress enacted Rule 10b-18, which grants companies a safe harbor provided they follow certain \nrules. Those rules form a legal shield from the threat of being sued by specifying how a company can execute \na buyback in terms of manner, timing, price, and volume.72 The Securities and Exchange Commission has \nsubsequently updated the rules to reflect current market conditions. The year 1982 marks a new regime in \nhow companies return cash to shareholders. \n \nWhen assessing a repurchase program, investors and executives should consider the golden rule of share \nbuybacks, which states: A company should repurchase its shares only when its stock is trading below its \nexpected value and when no better investment opportunities are available.73 \n \nThe golden rule addresses both absolute and relative value. Companies should only invest where they \nanticipate a payoff that has a positive net present value. This is a fancy way of saying \u201cyou will get more than \nwhat you pay for.\u201d This absolute benchmark applies to all of a company\u2019s capital allocation decisions, including \nM&A, capital expenditures, and R&D.  \n \nThe rule also addresses relative value when it emphasizes that companies should prioritize higher return \ninternal investment opportunities over buybacks. Ideally, executives should rank their investment opportunities \nby expected return and fund them from highest to lowest. A company should expect that all of the investments \nit funds will earn above the cost of capital. While access to capital can be a constraint, most companies \ngenerate sufficient cash flow to fund their internal investments.74 \n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n1,800\n2,000\n2,200\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nS&P 500 Index\nBuybacks ($ billions)\nBuybacks\nS&P 500\n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n42 \nThe second aspect of assessing a buyback is its impact on various shareholders under different conditions. \nOnly if a stock trades exactly at intrinsic value do buybacks and dividends treat all shareholders the same. If a \nstock is overvalued or undervalued, the effect of a buyback is different for selling shareholders than it is for \nthose who continue to hold. \n \nFrom the company\u2019s standpoint, corporate value is conserved no matter how the company chooses to pay out \ncash. What differs is who wins and who loses as the result of buying stock below or above intrinsic value. \nSince management should focus on building value per share for continuing shareholders, it should always try \nto buy back shares that are undervalued. \n \nExhibit 39 illustrates the principle. Say we have a company with a value of $100,000 and 1,000 shares \noutstanding that decides to return $20,000 to its shareholders.  \n \nExhibit 39: The Value Conservation Principle \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nIn Scenario A, we assume the stock price is $200, double the fair value of $100 ($100,000/1,000).

Buying back overvalued \nstock benefits sellers at the expense of buyers. \n \nIn Scenario B, we assume the stock trades at one-half of fair value, or $50 per share. The company can buy \n400 shares, with $80,000 of remaining value and 600 shares outstanding. Now we see that the selling \nshareholders lose $50 per share ($50 proceeds - $100 value = -$50) and continuing shareholders gain \n$33.33 per share ($133.33 continuing value - $100 initial value = $33.33).   \nScenario A\nScenario B\nScenario C\nAssumptions\nBase\nAssume \nbuyback @ $200\nAssume \nbuyback @ $50\nAssumptions\nAssume dividend \nof $20\nBuyback amount\n$20,000\n$20,000\nDividend amount\n$20,000\nFirm Value\n100,000\n$ \n$80,000\n$80,000\nFirm Value\n$80,000\nShares outstanding\n1,000\n1,000\n1,000\nShares outstanding\n1,000\nCurrent price\n$100\n$200\n$50\nCurrent price\n$10\nShares post buyback\n900\n600\nValue/share\n$100\n$88.89\n$133.33\nValue/share\n$80.00\nDividend/share\n$20.00\nSelling shareholders\n100\n400\n$200\n$50\nValue to sellers\n$20,000\n$20,000\nOngoing shareholders\n900\n600\nOngoing shareholders\n$80,000\n$88.89\n$133.33\nDividends\n$20,000\n$80,000\n$80,000\nTotal value\n$100,000\n$100,000\nTotal value\n$100,000\nPer share +/- sellers\n$100.00\n($50.00)\nPer share +/- holders\n($11.11)\n$33.33\n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n43 \nIn Scenario C, the company pays a $20 dividend to all shareholders. Just as in the prior scenarios, the firm \nvalue drops to $80,000, but each shareholder receives identical treatment, leaving aside tax considerations.  \n \nThis analysis suggests a couple of points that investors commonly overlook. First, if you are the shareholder of \na company that is buying back stock, doing nothing is doing something. By choosing to hold the shares \ninstead of selling a pro-rated amount, you are effectively increasing your percentage ownership in the \ncompany. One alternative is to sell shares in proportion to your stake, creating a homemade dividend and \nmaintaining a steady percentage ownership in the business. \n \nSecond, it is logical that you would prefer that the companies you hold in your portfolio buy back stock rather \nthan pay a dividend. If you own shares of companies that you think are undervalued, buybacks will increase \nvalue per share by definition. The only instance where this may not be true is if you believe that a dividend \nwould provide a more powerful signal to the market, hence creating more value than a buyback. \n \nTying together these thoughts, there are basically three schools of thought regarding buybacks: fair value, \nintrinsic value, and accounting-motivated. The intrinsic value school is where you want to be if possible. \n \nThe fair value school takes a steady and consistent approach to buybacks. Management believes that over \ntime it will buy back shares when they are both overvalued and undervalued, but for the most part when they \nare about fairly priced. This approach offers shareholders substantial flexibility as it allows them to hold shares \nand defer tax liabilities or create homemade dividends by selling a pro-rated number of shares.  \n \nThe fair value school is consistent with the free cash flow hypothesis, which says that managers who have \nexcess cash will invest it in projects with a negative net present value. By disbursing cash, a company buying \nback its shares reduces the risk of doing something foolish with the funds.75 Research suggests that most \ncompanies would have been better off buying back stock consistently versus their actual behavior of buying \nheavily in some periods and lightly, or not at all, in others.76 \n \nThe intrinsic value school believes a company should only buy back shares when it deems them to be \nundervalued. A company must have asymmetric information or beliefs, as well as analytical prowess, to \nprofitably pursue this approach. Asymmetric information means that company management has information \nthat the stock price fails to reflect. Differing beliefs occur when management has the same information as the \nmarket but comes to different conclusions about what that information means.  \n \nAnalytical prowess means that the executives at the company know how to translate their differential view into \nan estimate of the relationship between the stock price and intrinsic value. Investors should not assume that \nmanagement has this ability. Indeed, surveys consistently show that executives believe their stock to be cheap. \nFor example, in a survey from mid-2013, 60 percent of chief financial officers (CFOs) thought that U.S. \nequities were overvalued, but only 11 percent thought their own stock was overvalued.77    \n \nManagement can act on its conviction by being bold with its buyback program, buying back a substantial \npercentage of the shares or even buying them at a premium to the prevailing price through a tender offer.78 \nThis school fits the signaling hypothesis, which suggests that companies buy back shares when they deem \nthem to trade below intrinsic value. Further, it is important to focus on actual share buybacks versus buyback \nannouncements. The evidence supporting the signaling hypothesis is mixed, but 85 percent of CFOs believe \nthat their buyback decision conveys information.79      \n \nBoosting short-term accounting results, especially earnings per share (EPS), is what motivates the final \nschool.80 When surveyed, three-fourths of CFOs cite increasing EPS as an important or very important factor \n"

Two-thirds of CFOs say that offsetting the dilution from option or other \nstock-based programs is important. This underscores another essential point: you should consider buybacks \nnet of equity issuance.  \n \nThe problem with the accounting-motivated school is that its actions are not necessarily aligned with the \nprinciple of value creation.81 For example, there may be a case where buying back overvalued stock boosts \nEPS and helps management reach a financial objective that prompts a bonus. In this case the motivation is \nimpure because management\u2019s proper goal is to allocate capital in an economically sound fashion for \nshareholders.  \n \nInvestors assessing companies buying back stock should make an effort to determine which school the \nmanagement team is in. It can be the case that management buys back stock for the right reason and realizes \naccounting benefits as a result. That\u2019s fine. But investors should be on the lookout for companies that make \ndecisions based on the accounting results without sufficient regard for the economic merits.    \n \nA couple of findings from the academic research are worth highlighting. The first is that it appears companies \nare increasingly using buybacks as a substitute for dividends.82 As a result, total shareholder yield (sum of \ndividends and buybacks divided by equity market capitalization) may be a better indicator of a company\u2019s \nproclivity to pay out than a simple dividend yield. Exhibit 40 shows the total shareholder yield, with and without \nequity issuance, and the cost of equity for the top 1,500 companies in the U.S. from 1980-2015. The \nshareholder yield has been remarkably stable, belying the decline in dividend yield. Equity issuance lowers the \ntotal shareholder yield by 140 basis points on average, with a range of 70 to 310 basis points.83 \n \nExhibit 40: U.S. Total Shareholder Yield versus Cost of Equity, 1980-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT and Aswath Damodaran.  \nNote: Top 1,500 U.S. industrial firms. \n \n \n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n20%\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\nCost of Equity\nTotal Shareholder Yield (Gross)\nTotal Shareholder Yield (Net)\n"

This is likely the \nresult of a couple of drivers, including the novelty of buybacks and hence the stronger signal they sent, as well \nas the fact that more buybacks were in the form of Dutch auctions and tender offers versus open market \npurchases, which are more prevalent today. Analysis of recent buybacks suggests mixed effects.84 \n \nBuybacks continue at a healthy clip. For example, buybacks for the companies in the S&P 500 totaled $585 \nbillion over the 12 months ending June 30, 2016.85 This fits the idea that managements buy when they feel \nconfident. Buybacks and dividends combined totaled $975 billion for companies in the S&P 500 for the 12 \nmonths ending June 30, 2016, in line with the all-time 12-month record set in March 2016.  \n \nAssessing Management\u2019s Capital Allocation Skills \n \n \u201cAll roads in managerial evaluation lead to capital allocation.\u201d86 \n \nThe final part of this report provides a framework for assessing a management team\u2019s capital allocation skills. \nThis framework has four components. First, you want to study how a company has allocated capital in the \npast. Next, you need to examine the company\u2019s return on invested capital and, more importantly, return on \nincremental invested capital. Third is a careful consideration of incentives and corporate governance. And  \nfinally, you can compare management\u2019s actions to the five principles of capital allocation.  \n \nRegulation may constrain the choices a management team has in the allocation of capital. In industries \nincluding insurance and banks, regulators seek to establish capital adequacy to offset possible adverse \noutcomes. In utilities, regulations limit the returns on invested capital in order to best serve the public good. \nUnderstanding regulations and how they might change is essential for these industries. \n     \nPast Spending Patterns. The first step in assessing a company\u2019s capital allocation skills is to see how \nmanagement has allocated capital in the past. You should break the analysis into two parts, one dealing with \ninvestments in the operations (M&A, capital expenditures, R&D, and working capital) and the other with \nreturning cash to claimholders (dividends, buybacks, and debt repayment).  \n \nThe value of a business is the present value of future free cash flow (FCF). Free cash flow is defined as net \noperating profit after tax (NOPAT), a measure of the cash earnings of the business that assumes no financial \nleverage, minus investment (I) in future growth: \n \nFCF = NOPAT \u2013 I \n \nNOPAT is determined by sales and sales growth, operating profit margins, and the cash tax rate. Investment \nis determined by changes in working capital, capital expenditures net of depreciation, and acquisitions net of \ndivestitures. You can calculate these sums using what Alfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at the J. L. \nKellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, calls \u201cvalue drivers.\u201d87 Capital allocation \nis primarily about the value drivers that determine investment.  \n \nTo make the comparison clean, Rappaport defines value drivers as the number of cents the company invests \nin each use for every $1.00 change in sales. For example, if a company\u2019s working capital grows by $10 in a \ngiven year and its sales grow by $100, the incremental working capital rate is 10 percent ($10/$100). If in \nthe same year capital expenditures are $130 and depreciation is $70, the fixed capital rate is 60 percent \n($60/$100). You can calculate the value driver for acquisitions less divestitures in the same way. \n \n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n46 \nA useful first step in assessing capital allocation is to see how much was invested in each area for an \nincremental dollar of sales over time. We like to calculate results for a minimum of three years, if available, and \nprefer to go back five to ten years when possible. Here are the numbers for Walmart for the five years ending \nin fiscal 2016:88 \n \nIncremental working capital investment rate  =  3.6 percent \nIncremental fixed capital rate  \n \n \n \n \n= 31.6 percent \nIncremental M&A rate   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n= 0.2 percent \n \nInstantly, you will see whether the company is investing in working capital, capital expenditures, or M&A. That \nallows you to focus your attention. In this case, it is clear that capital expenditures are the main use of capital.   \n \nHere are the numbers for Cisco Systems over the past five years (fiscal 2011-2016): \n \nIncremental working capital investment rate  =  17.0 percent \nIncremental fixed capital rate  \n \n \n \n \n= 41.2 percent \nIncremental M&A rate   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n= 226.7 percent \n \nNow you can see that M&A has been more important than capital expenditures. In this case, you would roll up \nyour sleeves and figure out how management approaches its M&A decisions. You might also review past \ndeals to see how the market reacted.  \n \nThis analysis is also useful to assess the change in practices from one CEO to the next. Some CEOs may \nseek to grow primarily organically, which will raise one set of analytical issues. A successor may be more \nacquisitive, raising a separate set of issues. Assuming past behaviors provide some basis for anticipating \nfuture behavior, this analysis is very useful. \n \nLook for inflection points as well. Are capital expenditures ramping up versus prior levels of spending? Is the \ncompany improving its cash conversion cycle? You want to note changes in spending patterns so as to align \nyour analysis with the developments at the company.  \n \nThe second component of this analysis is to understand how and why management has returned cash to \nclaimholders. This also requires considering a company\u2019s capital structure and whether it can or should \nchange. The key is to understand the rationale and motivation for the decisions management makes to \nevaluate whether they are consistent with the principles of building long-term value per share.     \n \nIn assessing a company\u2019s past capital allocation, it\u2019s interesting to determine who exactly is making the \ndecision. Researchers surveyed executives and found that CEOs are least likely to delegate decisions about \nM&A but much more likely to defer to colleagues on issues such as capital structure and payout ratio. CEOs \ndelegate less if they have a master\u2019s degree in business administration, have been around for a long time, or \nare particularly knowledgeable about a project. CEOs delegate more when the firm is large or complex. Most \ncompanies say they use the net present value rule to make investments, but the reputation of the division \nmanager requesting resources is important as is senior management\u2019s \u201cgut feel.\u201d89 \n \nIt\u2019s also useful to understand how the process works. As a practical matter, many companies approach capital \nallocation through a budgeting process. In a simple version, each division has a capital budget and can either \naccept that amount or ask for more. Such a request may be subject to a value audit. Research shows that \nsuch a budgeting process can lead to overinvestment in low return projects if the budget exceeds the \nopportunities and underinvestment if the opportunities exceed the budget.90    \n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n47 \nCalculating Return on Invested Capital and Return on Incremental Invested Capital. The second \ncomponent to assessing capital allocation is determining the output of management\u2019s decisions through an \nanalysis of return on invested capital (ROIC) and return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC). ROIC provides \na picture of the company\u2019s overall performance while ROIIC dwells on the efficiency of incremental spending. \nOur report, \u201cCalculating Return on Invested Capital: How to Determine ROIC and Address Common Issues,\u201d \nprovides details on how to calculate ROIC and ROIIC and includes case studies.91 Here\u2019s a quick summary.  \n \nNOPAT is the numerator of ROIC. Because NOPAT assumes no financial leverage, the sum is the same \nwhether a company is highly levered or free of debt. This is essential for comparability within and across \nindustries. \n \nInvested capital is the denominator of ROIC. You can think of invested capital in two ways that are equivalent. \nFirst, it\u2019s the amount of net assets a company needs to run its business. Alternatively, it\u2019s the amount of \nfinancing a company\u2019s creditors and shareholders need to supply to fund those net assets. These approaches \nare the same since dual-entry accounting requires that both sides of the balance sheet equal one another.  \n \nYou should calculate ROIC using the assets side of the balance sheet if given a choice, as that allows you to \nsee how efficiently the company is using capital. In contrast, the right-hand side shows only how much capital \nthe firm has and how it has chosen to finance the business. Ideally, you should calculate ROIC from both the \nleft- and right-hand sides of the balance sheet.  \n \nIn fiscal 2016, Walmart\u2019s NOPAT was $15.5 billion and its average invested capital was $143.0 billion, for an \nROIC of 10.8 percent. This is well in excess of the company\u2019s cost of capital. Since strategies, a bundle of \ninvestments, must earn a return in excess of the cost of capital in order to pass the NPV test, ROIC can be a \nrough proxy for value creation. \n \nAcademic research shows that the market rewards investment in organic growth in high return businesses. \nTypically, companies that earn high ROICs are said to have some sort of competitive advantage. A quick \nanalysis of ROIC indicates whether a company has a competitive advantage and, if so, what lies at the \nfoundation of that advantage.  \n \nBruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School, argues that there are two sources of competitive \nadvantage: consumer advantage and production advantage. The key to each advantage is the creation of \nbarriers to entry that fend off competition. Barriers to entry are particularly strong when a company enjoys \neconomies of scale, which mean that the cost per unit for the incumbent is lower than that for a challenger.92 \n \nA consumer advantage is the result of the habitual use of a product, high costs of switching to a new product, \nor high costs of searching for a superior product. A production advantage allows a company to deliver its \ngoods or services more cheaply than its competitors and is the result of either privileged access to inputs or to \nproprietary technology that is difficult or costly to imitate. A competitive strategy analysis focuses on identifying \nthese sources of advantage and assessing their durability.  \n \nROIC can provide a quick and useful way to investigate competitive advantage. You can decompose ROIC into \ntwo parts, a modified version of what is known as a DuPont Analysis:  \n \nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) = NOPAT     x   ____Sales____               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n Sales  \n           Invested Capital \n \n"

Sales/Invested Capital, or \ninvested capital turnover, is a measure of capital efficiency. Sales cancel out when you multiply the terms and \nyou are left with NOPAT/Invested Capital, or ROIC.  \n \nIt is easy to imagine two companies arriving at the same ROIC by different paths.

If a company gets to a high ROIC through a high NOPAT margin, you \nshould focus your analysis on a consumer advantage. If the company\u2019s high return comes from a high turnover \nratio, emphasize analysis of a production advantage. For companies that are high in both, consider how the \nadvantages are reinforced by economies of scale.  \n \nExhibit 41: ROIC and Competitive Advantage \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nHaving defined and discussed ROIC we must now emphasize that it\u2019s not the absolute ROIC that matters but \nrather the change in ROIC. Or, even more accurately, what\u2019s crucial is the expectation for changes in ROIC. \nNeedless to say, the market is not always perfect at anticipating change in ROIC, so having a sense of where \nROIC is going can be of great value.93 \n \nOne potentially useful measure is return on incremental invested capital, or ROIIC. ROIIC properly recognizes \nthat sunk costs are irrelevant and that what matters is the relationship between incremental earnings and \nincremental investments.  \n \nThe definition of ROIIC is as follows:  \n \nROIIC =  \n           \n \n \n     Year2 NOPAT \u2013 Year1 NOPAT     \n                              \n   Year1 invested capital \u2013 Year0 invested capital  \n \n \nConsumer and \nProduction \nAdvantage\nNo Advantage\nInvested Capital Turnover\nNOPAT Margin\nConsumer \nAdvantage\nProduction \nAdvantage\n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n49 \nIn words, ROIIC compares the change in NOPAT in a given year to the investments made in the prior year. \nLet\u2019s say a company\u2019s Year0 invested capital is $2,000 and it invests $200 during the year (making Year1 \ninvested capital $2,200). Further, NOPAT from Year1 to Year2 climbs from $300 to $350. Given these \nassumptions, ROIIC is 25 percent [($350-300)/($2,200-2,000)].  \n \nIt is preferable to calculate ROIIC on a rolling three- or five-year basis for businesses with investments or \nNOPAT that are lumpy. At the other extreme, you can take quarterly changes and annualize them if you want \nto see if there are any recent trends or improvements. Obviously these results will be the most volatile, but \nthey can give you some insights into how the business is doing. As an example of the calculation, Walmart\u2019s \nROIIC is 105 percent for fiscal 2016, -44 percent for a rolling three-year period ended 2016, and -11 percent \nfor the rolling five-year period ended 2016.  \n \nHigh ROIICs generally indicate that a business is either capital efficient or has substantial operating leverage \n(which often proves transitory). Calculating a company\u2019s historical ROIIC can be very helpful in understanding \npotential earnings moves.  \n \nA final note of warning: ROIIC\u2014for a host of technical reasons\u2014is not really an economic measure of value. \nFurther, ROIIC makes the strong underlying assumption that the ROIC on the base business remains stable. \nThis is clearly not always true. So use the measure to determine the likelihood of change and to understand \npast patterns, but don\u2019t compare it with the cost of capital or consider it a true return measure.94 \n \nIncentives and Corporate Governance. One of the essential lessons of economics is that incentives matter. \nBut it is also the case that incentives designed to achieve one objective can lead to unintended \nconsequences.95 The goal of this section is to consider whether the incentives a company has in place \nencourage judicious capital allocation. Most of these incentives address compensation.  \n \nAgency theory is the classic way to explain why the managers of a company may not act in the interests of the \nshareholders.96 The idea is that conflicts can arise when there is a separation between ownership and control \nof a firm. There are three areas where these conflicts tend to arise.97   \n \nThe first is that while it is clear that shareholders want management to maximize the value of their holdings, \nmanagement may derive benefits from controlling resources that don\u2019t enrich shareholders. For example, if \nremuneration is roughly correlated with the size of the firm, management may seek to do value-destroying \nM&A deals to grow.  \n \nThe second area of conflict is with tolerance for risk. Since shareholders tend to hold stocks as part of a \ndiversified portfolio and managers are disproportionately exposed to their own company, managers may seek \nless risk than shareholders would deem appropriate.  \n \nThe final conflict is with time horizon. To the degree that compensation plans have a shorter time horizon than \nthe period shareholders use to assess the merit of an investment, there can be a mismatch. So managers may \ndwell on short-term boosts in earnings. Indeed, research shows that a large majority of managers are willing to \nforego value-creating investments to deliver near-term earnings.98  \n \nSo what kind of executive compensation scheme provides the proper incentives for management to build \nvalue? You can start with what you don\u2019t want, which is incentive compensation that is completely \nindependent of value creation. In this case, an executive would have limited incentive to build value because \nhe or she would not benefit directly from that increase. At the other extreme would be the case where the \nCEO owns 100 percent of the company, blunting any concerns about agency theory.  \n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n50 \nAs a broad characterization, compensation for CEOs in the past 30 years has moved from one based heavily \non salary and bonus to one much more sensitive to stock price performance.99 But the shift to stock-based \ncompensation, seemingly a step in reducing agency costs, has brought with it a host of other challenges. \nMost pronounced is that many executives are now focused on boosting the stock price by whatever means \nthey can rather than focusing on creating value, which ultimately gets reflected in the market price.  \n \nThere is a spirited debate about whether equity-based compensation is doing a proper job of encouraging \nmanagement to focus on long-term performance.100 In practice, there are two challenges to equity-based \ncompensation that make it less effective than it might be. Properly structured compensation programs can \naddress both challenges, but rarely do. The first is a company\u2019s stock price is only a rough measure of \ncorporate performance. Factors outside of management\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, \ninterest rates, inflation expectations, and the equity risk premium, can play a larger role in stock price changes \nthan corporate results do.101       \n \nThe second challenge is that while the stock market does provide managers with information about investment \nopportunities and the past decisions of managers, that information can be noisy in the short run.102 That few \nmanagers understand market expectations effectively compounds this challenge.103 \n \nBefore discussing how to address these challenges, let\u2019s take a look at the metrics that companies most \ncommonly use in their incentive compensation. Frederic W. Cook & Co., a consulting firm dedicated to \nexecutive compensation, does an annual survey of the largest 250 companies in the S&P 500. Exhibit 42 \nshows the results. In recent years, TSR has emerged as the most common incentive metric, followed by \nmeasures of profit and capital efficiency.104  \n \nExhibit 42: Most Commonly Used Long-Term Incentive Metrics \n \nSource: Frederic W. Cook & Co., \u201cThe 2015 Top 250 Report: Long-Term Incentive Grant Practices for Executives,\u201d December 2015. \n \nOn the surface it may appear encouraging that TSR is on top of the list. But there are a couple of reasons for \ncaution. Using TSR as an incentive metric doesn\u2019t really matter if a company doesn\u2019t know how to create \nvalue. Having the right goal isn\u2019t helpful if you don\u2019t know how to achieve that goal. And since TSR is absolute \nversus relative to some benchmark, external factors may play a bigger role in compensation than company-\nspecific factors. So unless TSR is relative to an appropriate benchmark, it fails to reflect the efforts of the firm.  \n \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT team built a scorecard to assess the quality of management incentives. Unlike the \nFrederic W. Cook & Co. survey, the HOLT approach is to award points for positive incentive measures such \nas operational drivers, return on capital, relative TSR, and long-term plans, and to deduct points for negative \nmeasures including no disclosure, absence of financial targets, substantial option expense, and no long-term \nplan. The sample includes most of the top 1,000 companies in the U.S.105  \n \n2015\n2014\n2013\nTotal shareholder return\n54%\n58%\n54%\nProfit (EPS, etc.)\n51\n50\n49\nCapital efficiency\n41\n41\n40\nRevenue\n20\n21\n20\nCash flow\n11\n13\n12\nOther\n14\n15\n17\n"

The key is to look for a company that \nseeks to build long-term value per share with the belief that the stock market will ultimately follow that value. If \nthe market fails to reflect that value, management can take action by sharpening communication or buying \nback stock.   \n \nThere are three elements to an incentive compensation program that supports judicious capital allocation.106 \nThe first is to compensate senior executives with stock options or restricted stock units that are indexed to \neither the market overall or an appropriate peer group.  Presuming that exogenous factors affect peers in a \nsimilar fashion as the target firm, indexing takes a large step toward isolating management skill and reducing \nthe role of luck. Only individuals who can influence the stock price should be paid in equity, which limits the \nnumber of eligible executives.  \n \nSecond, executives who run operating units, as well as front line employees, should be paid for exceeding \nlong-term goals for the operating value drivers. These include sales growth, operating profit margins, and \nsome measure of return on invested capital. Broader value drivers can be further broken down into leading \nindicators of value, performance measures that roll up to the value drivers.  \n \nFor example, if a retailer has a goal of opening five new stores in a year, a leading indicator of value might \ninclude finding a store location and signing a lease. Here again, the incentives are awarded based on what the \nindividual employees can control. Warren Buffett explains that a good plan \u201cshould be (1) tailored to the \neconomics of the specific operating business; (2) simple in character so that the degree to which they are \nbeing realized can be easily measured; and (3) directly related to the daily activities of the plan participants.\u201d107 \n \n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nInformation Technology\nTelecommunication Services\nUtilities\nEnergy\nFinancials\nConsumer Discretionary\nHealthcare\nIndustrials\nConsumer Staples\nMaterials\n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n52 \nFinally, recognize that the debate about the short term versus the long term is an empty one. Instead, \nacknowledge that the goal is to maximize long-term value per share. This applies to activities that \nmanagement expects to pay off quickly or in the distant future.108 Amazon.com is a company that appears \ncomfortable taking a long-term view. The company\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, argues that there is less competition \nfor long-term initiatives. He says, \u201cIf everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you\u2019re \ncompeting against a lot of people. But if you\u2019re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you\u2019re now \ncompeting against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by \nlengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon \nwe like things to work in five to seven years.\u201d109 \n \nIncentives are an important determinant of behavior. Examine whether a management team is committed to \nbuilding long-term value by examining their words, incentives, and actions. Agency costs are alive and well, \nand in many cases companies try to boost their stock price using artificial or superficial methods versus \nboosting underlying long-term value through the proper conception and execution of a strategic plan.  \n \nFive Principles of Capital Allocation. In their book, The Value Imperative, James McTaggart, Peter Kontes, \nand Michael Mankins describe four principles of resource allocation that apply readily to our discussion about \ncapital allocation.110 We added one to expand the list to five and believe that these principles are a sound \nbenchmark that you can use to measure management\u2019s mindset regarding their capital allocation practices.111  \n  \n1. Zero-based capital allocation. Companies generally think about capital allocation on an incremental \nbasis. For example, a study of more than 1,600 U.S. companies by McKinsey found that there was a \n0.92 correlation between how much capital a business unit received in one year and the next. For one-\nthird of the companies, that correlation was 0.99.112 In other words, inertia appears to play a large role in \ncapital allocation.  \n \nThe proper approach is zero-based, which simply asks, \u201cWhat is the right amount of capital (and the right \nnumber of people) to have in this business in order to support the strategy that will create the most \nwealth?\u201d113 There is no reference to how much the company has already invested in the business, only \nhow much should be invested.  \n \nResearch by McKinsey suggests that those companies that showed a zero-based allocation mindset, and \nhence were the most proactive in reallocating resources, delivered higher TSRs than the companies that \ntook more of an incremental approach.114 Further, academic research shows that those companies that \nare good at internal capital allocation tend to be good at external allocation as well.115     \n \n2. Fund strategies, not projects. The idea here is that capital allocation is not about assessing and \napproving projects, but rather assessing and approving strategies and determining the projects that \nsupport the strategies. Practitioners and academics sometimes fail to make this vital distinction.116 There \ncan be value-creating projects within a failed strategy, and value-destroying projects within a solid strategy.  \n \nAnother reason to be cautious about a project approach is that it is easy to game the system. It is \ncommon for companies to have thresholds for project approval. For instance, a plant manager can \napprove small projects, business unit heads larger ones, the CEO bigger ones still, and the board of \ndirectors the largest investments. But at each level, analysts can manipulate the numbers to look good. \nOne of the aspects of the institutional imperative, as Buffett describes it, is, \u201cAny business craving of the \nleader, however foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared \nby his troops.\u201d117 \n \n"

      "text": "October 19, 2016  \n \nCapital Allocation \n53 \nThe key to this principle is recognizing that a business strategy is a bundle of projects and that the value of \nthe bundle is what matters. The CEO and board must evaluate alternative strategies and consider the \nfinancial prospects of each.   \n \n3. No capital rationing. The attitude at many companies, which the results of surveys support, is that \ncapital is \u201cscarce but free.\u201d The sense is that the business generates a limited amount of capital which \nmakes it \u201cscarce,\u201d but since it comes from within it is \u201cfree.\u201d   \n \nThe primary source of capital for companies in the U.S. is the cash they generate. The patterns of \nspending on the various uses of capital indicate the attitude of managements. Capital expenditures, R&D, \nand dividends receive priority, and M&A and share buybacks are considered when economic results are \ngood. Internal capital allocation tends to be very stable from year to year, and inertia plays a large role. \nBusiness units may jockey for more capital but, as we have seen, the changes in year-to-year allocation \ntend to be modest. These observations are consistent with the \u201cscarce but free\u201d mindset. \n \nA better mindset is that capital is plentiful but expensive. There are two sources of capital that companies \ncan tap beyond the cash generated internally. The first is redeploying capital from businesses that do not \nearn sufficient returns. Management can execute this inside the company or sell the underperforming \nbusinesses and redeploy the proceeds. The second is the capital markets. When executives have value-\ncreating strategies that need capital, the markets are there to fund them in all but the most challenging \nenvironments.    \n \nThe notion that internally generated capital is free is also problematic. Thoughtful capital allocators \nrecognize that all capital has an opportunity cost, whether the source is internal or external. As a \nconsequence, managers should explicitly account for the cost of capital in all capital allocation decisions. \nToo frequently, companies select actions that add to earnings or earnings per share without properly \nreckoning for value. \n \nThe limiting resource for many companies is not access to capital but rather access to talent. Finding \nexecutives with the proper skills for success, including an aptitude for allocating capital, is not easy. This is \na valid challenge but relates to recruiting and development, not access to capital. \n \n4. Zero tolerance for bad growth. Companies that wish to grow will inevitably make investments that do \nnot pay off. The failure rate of new businesses and new products is high. Seeing an investment flop is no \nsin; indeed it is essential to the process of creating value. What is a sin is remaining committed to a \nstrategy that has no prospects to create value, hence draining human and financial resources. \n \nExecutives who follow this principle invest in innovation but are ruthless in cutting losses when they see \nthat a strategy is unlikely to pay off. Many companies have the opportunity to create substantial value by \nexiting businesses where they have no advantage. This reduces cross-subsidization within the organization \nand allows for the best managers to work for the businesses that create the most value.  \n \n5. Know the value of assets, and be ready to take action to create value. Intelligent capital allocation \nis similar to managing a portfolio of stocks in that it is very useful to have a sense of the difference, if any, \nbetween the value and price of each asset. This includes the value of the company and its stock price. \nNaturally, such analysis must include considerations such as taxes.  \n \nWith a ready sense of value and price, management should be prepared to take action to create value. \nSometimes that means acquiring, other times that means divesting, and frequently there are no clear gaps \n"

In the 1960s, in \u201cA Modest Proposal,\u201d I suggested that companies should be \nrequired to pay out 100% of their net income as cash dividends.

Investors would do that \nonly if they were happy both with the dividends they\u2019d received and the future prospects of the company. \nMarkets as a whole know more than any individual or group of individuals. So the best way to allocate capital \nis to let the market do it, rather than the management of each company.

One exception is the surge in \u201cinversions,\u201d cases \nwhere U.S. companies change domiciles after acquiring foreign targets to reduce their taxes. Congress \npassed a law in 2004 that was meant to stop inversions, but companies figured out how to circumvent the \nrules a few years ago. This led to a mini-boom in inversions, including more than 20 since 2012. See Zachary \nMider and Jesse Drucker, \u201cTax Inversion: How U.S. Companies Buy Tax Breaks,\u201d Bloomberg.com, April 6, \n2016.

Assume a buyer has a market capitalization of $2,000 and a seller has a pre-deal \nmarket capitalization of $800. Say that the buyer bids $1,000 (a $200 premium, or 25 percent) in cash but \nthat the true synergy is $400. The value of the buyer would rise to $2,200 as the synergy exceeds the \npremium by $200. Now assume the same starting point but that the buyer is using stock for the deal. The \nbuyer will end up with two-thirds percent of the combined entity, and two-thirds of the $200 in additional value \nwill flow to the buyer and one-third will go to the seller. \n30 For a more detailed, and likely more accurate, approach see Bruce C. N. Greenwald, Judd Kahn, Paul D. \nSonkin, and Michael van Biema, Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond (Hoboken, NJ: John \nWiley & Sons, 2001), 96. Specifically, they recommend three steps: 1. Calculate the ratio of gross property, \nplant, and equipment (PPE) to sales for each of the past five years and find the average; 2. Use this to \nindicate the dollars of PPE it takes to support each dollar of sales; 3. Multiply this ratio by the growth (or \ndecrease) in sales dollars the company achieved in the current year. The result of that calculation is capital \nexpenditures dedicated to growth.  \n31 For a general framework for competitive strategy analysis, see Michael J.

Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default \nvariables and incorporated into the algorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and \nearnings data provided by outside data vendors are subject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying \neconomics of firm performance. These adjustments provide consistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies \nacross industries or national borders. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline \nvaluation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce alternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional \ninformation about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request. \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT \nvaluation model establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default \nvariables may also be adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur.
