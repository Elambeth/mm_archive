      "text": "April 25, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Gross Profitability \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nBenjamin Graham, the father of security analysis, spent some time with an aeronautical engineer named \nJames Rea in the 1970s. Together, they developed a screen to find attractive stocks that had ten criteria. \nBecause it was toward the end of Graham\u2019s life, some refer to the list as Graham\u2019s \u201clast will.\u201d2 About one-half \nof the measures were based on valuation, consistent with Graham\u2019s value orientation. But the other half of the \ncriteria addressed quality. So a company that passed the screen would be both statistically cheap and of high \nquality.  \n \nThis installment in our base rate series examines gross profitability, a measure of a company\u2019s ability to make \nmoney that has attracted the attention of academics and practitioners in recent years. Prior reports include \ntwo dedicated to the income statement, sales growth and net income growth, and one to Cash Flow Return \non Investment (CFROI\u00ae), a measure of economic profitability.3  \n \nRobert Novy-Marx, a professor of finance at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester, \ndefines gross profitability as revenues minus cost of goods sold, scaled by the book value of total assets. In \nother words, gross profitability is gross profit divided by assets. Investors can use gross profitability as a proxy \nfor quality and it is not positively correlated with classic measures of value.4 \n \nResearch shows that gross profitability is highly persistent in the short and long run. This means that you can \nmake a reasonable estimate of future profitability based on the past. Academic research also shows that firms \nwith high gross profitability deliver better total shareholder returns than those with low profitability. This is \ndespite the fact that they start with loftier price-to-book ratios.5  \n \nMany academics and practitioners now incorporate gross profitability into their asset pricing models. For \ninstance, Eugene Fama, a professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the Nobel Prize, and \nKenneth French, a professor of finance at the Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College, include \nprofitability as one of the factors that helps explain changes in asset prices. The others include beta (a \nmeasure of the sensitivity of an asset\u2019s returns to market returns), size, valuation, and investment.6 The \ndefinition of profitability that Fama and French use differs somewhat from that of Novy-Marx but captures the \nsame essence. \n \nThe power of profitability to explain total shareholder returns appears to be a global phenomenon.7 Using \nCompustat data (July 1963 to December 2010) and Compustat Global data (July 1990 to October 2009), \nNovy-Marx found that the stocks of more profitable firms outperformed the stocks of less profitable firms in \nthe United States as well as in developed markets outside the U.S. Both samples exclude stocks of \ncompanies in the financial services sector. These results are consistent with a study that examined the effect \nof gross profitability on total shareholder returns in 41 countries from 1980 to 2010.8  \n \nGross profitability may also be a useful factor to screen for in a search for attractive stocks. Profitability can \nprovide a very different signal than a price-earnings (P/E) multiple, which is the most common metric analysts \nuse to value stocks. A stock that appears unattractive using a P/E multiple may look attractive using gross \nprofitability, and a stock that appears unattractive using gross profitability may look attractive using a P/E \nmultiple. \n \nTake Amazon.com as a case. The stock had a trailing P/E multiple of roughly 540 at year-end 2015 based \non a price of $676 on December 31 and full-year reported earnings per share of $1.25. For context, the P/E \nmultiple was 20 for the S&P 500 at the same time. Based purely on its P/E multiple, the valuation of \nAmazon.com appeared high.  \n"

      "text": "April 25, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Gross Profitability \n3 \nThe company\u2019s gross profitability told a different story. For 2015, Amazon.com\u2019s gross profitability was 0.54 \n(gross profit of $35 billion and total assets of $65 billion). According to Novy-Marx, gross profitability of 0.33 \nor higher is generally attractive.9 Not only did Amazon.com\u2019s recent gross profitability surpass that level easily, \nit has been well above that threshold for most of the company\u2019s history (see Exhibit 1). \n \nExhibit 1: Amazon.com\u2019s Gross Profitability, 1997-2015 \n \nSource: FactSet. \n \nBase Rate of Gross Profitability \n \nTwo common ways of making a forecast include bottom-up research (known as the \u201cinside view\u201d), which is \nthe most natural approach, and application of a base rate (\u201coutside view\u201d) to see what the results have been \nfor an appropriate reference class. The research in decision making shows that the bottom-up approach is \nsubject to biases and that incorporating the base rate generally improves the accuracy of the forecast.10 You \nwant to combine the two approaches intelligently.  \n \nThere is a technique to blend the approaches that we apply to gross profitability.11 The basic idea is if an \noutcome in the present is consistent with the past, you can place more weight on the inside view. On the \nother hand, if the present outcome is very different than the past, you should place greater emphasis on the \noutside view.  \n \nThe key to the method is correlation, which measures the degree of the linear relationship between variables \nin a pair of distributions. The value of a correlation coefficient can fall between -1.0 (the rise in one variable \nperfectly correlates with the fall of the other) to 1.0 (both variables move in tandem). A zero correlation \nindicates randomness. Correlations for gross profitability are high and positive.  \n \nIf the correlation between two distributions is high, then what happened before gives you a really good sense \nof what will follow. For example, the correlation between the expense ratio for U.S. equity mutual funds today \nand three years ago is about 0.98. Provided that correlation persists, you can forecast a mutual fund\u2019s future \nexpense ratio with a great deal of accuracy if you know the ratio today.12 The bottom-up work is highly \nrelevant. \n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015\nGross Profitability \n"

      "text": "April 25, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Gross Profitability \n4 \nIf the correlation is low, what happened before provides little sense of what will happen next. Alpha, a measure \nof a fund\u2019s risk-adjusted excess return, is a good example. For U.S. mutual funds that invest in stocks of large \ncapitalization companies, the correlation between the three-year periods of alpha is 0.05. That means knowing \na mutual find\u2019s alpha from 2010-2012 would tell you little about the fund\u2019s alpha from 2013-2015. As a \nconsequence, your best forecast for future alpha is close to the average of the reference class.  \n  \nExhibit 2 shows that the Novy-Marx definition of gross profitability is very persistent over one-, three-, and \nfive-year periods. For example, the correlation between profitability in the current year and three years in the \nfuture has a coefficient, r, of 0.89 (middle panel of Exhibit 2). But even the five-year correlation is high at \n0.82 (right panel).  \n \nThis universe includes the top 1,000 firms in the world from 1950 to 2014 as measured by market \ncapitalization. The sample includes dead companies but excludes firms in the financial services and utilities \nsectors. The data include nearly 40,000 company years, and there is no need to take into account inflation \nbecause profitability is expressed as a ratio. \n \nExhibit 2: Persistence of Gross Profitability \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae. \n \nExhibit 3 shows the stability of gross profitability. We start by sorting companies into quintiles based on gross \nprofitability at the beginning of a year. We then follow the gross profitability for each of the five cohorts. There \nis very little regression toward the mean. The spread from the highest to the lowest quintile shrinks only \nslightly, from 0.55 to 0.50. Given this stability, a sensible forecast is to start with last year\u2019s profitability and \nseek reasons to move away from it.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\nGross Profitability Next Year\nGross Profitability\nr = 0.95\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\nGross Profitability in 3 Years\nGross Profitability\nr = 0.89\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\nGross Profitability in 5 Years\nGross Profitability\nr = 0.82\n"

Two aspects of the \nexhibit are worth highlighting. The first is the ordering of r from high to low. This gives you a sense of the rate \nof regression toward the mean by sector.

Keep in mind that regression toward the mean works \non a population but not necessarily on every individual company.  \n \nThe third and fourth columns show the median and mean, or average, gross profitability for each sector. We \ninclude medians because the gross profitability in many sectors does not follow a normal distribution. (When \nthe average is higher than the median, the distribution is skewed to the right.) Still, the means are only 5-10 \npercent higher than the medians.  \n \nThe two columns at the right show measures of variability. The coefficient of variation, a normalized measure, \ncaptures dispersion. The coefficient of variation equals the standard deviation of gross profitability divided by \naverage gross profitability.
