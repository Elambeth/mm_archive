Invested capital, the denominator of ROIC, seeks \nto reflect the cumulative amount of that investment spending.  \n\u201cMake money\u201d is captured in net operating profit after taxes \n(NOPAT), the numerator of ROIC. ROIC is therefore how much \nmoney a company makes divided by how much it spent to make \nit. A high ROIC indicates that a company is generating a healthy \nlevel of profits on its investment. \nHowever, simply making money is too modest a goal. The reason \nis that the investment could have produced a profit by being spent \nelsewhere. The foregone profit from the next best alternative is an \nopportunity cost. For example, a company that earns five percent \non an investment that could have earned seven percent \nelsewhere destroys value because of the missed opportunity.  \nThe opportunity cost of capital is therefore the hurdle rate for an \ninvestment. Because most firms finance their operations with debt \nand equity, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the \nthreshold of return a company must meet to create value.3            \nIn cases where a company\u2019s ROIC is equal to its WACC, an \ninvestment of one dollar is worth one dollar. For example, if the \nROIC and WACC are 7 percent, a $100 investment that generates \na perpetual return of $7 would be valued in the market at $100 \n($7/.07). No value is created or lost.   \nBy extension, if the company invests one dollar at an ROIC that is \nabove the cost of capital, it becomes worth more than one dollar \nin the market.4 Conversely, investments below the cost of capital \ndestroy value.   \nThe dollar bill test makes perfect sense in theory. The issue is \nwhether the market reflects it in practice.5 Arriving at a definitive \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Further, \ncompanies grow at various rates. That means companies with equivalent spreads between ROIC and WACC \nmight have ratios of market value to invested capital that differ because of that growth potential. \nExhibit 1 shows the relationship between ROIC \u2013 WACC and the ratio of enterprise value to invested capital. \nEnterprise value is the book value of debt plus the market value of equity minus cash. The data reveal that the \nmarket does a decent job of recognizing and rewarding the spread between ROIC and WACC.  \nExhibit 1: The One Dollar Test for the Top 500 Companies by Sales, 2022  \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Top 500 by sales in the Russell 3000 excluding financials and real estate; ROIC and WACC based on calendar year, \nand ROIC adjusted to reflect intangible investments; Enterprise value as of 12/31/22; Truncated axes for visualization. \nThe correlation coefficient, r, is a measure of the degree of linear relationship between two variables in a pair of \ndistributions. Positive correlations take a value of zero to 1.0. Zero means there is no relationship at all and 1.0 \nindicates the relationship is perfect. The r between ROIC \u2013 WACC and enterprise value to invested capital is \n0.58. That figure rises to 0.78 when the consensus for each company\u2019s expected sales growth for the next 2 \nyears is added as a second independent variable.  \nROIC helps us understand the free cash flows of tomorrow, which is important because the value of a financial \nasset is the present value of future free cash flows. Free cash flow for a given year equals NOPAT minus \ninvestment in future growth. NOPAT is the numerator of ROIC and change in invested capital is the investment \nin future growth. If you have a good estimate for ROIC and a forecast for growth, you have the ingredients to \nestimate free cash flows. \nThe stock market reflects expectations about future financial results.6 What matters for an investor is anticipating \nrevisions in expectations. This requires understanding what is priced in today and how the market\u2019s view of key \nvalue drivers, including sales, operating profit margins, and investment needs, are likely to change.  \nThis report extends our analysis of the ROICs for public companies in the U.S. and updates the data to cover \nthe years 1990 to 2022. We start by providing the latest ROIC figures, then examine the link between changes \nin ROICs and total shareholder returns (TSRs), and finish by reviewing elements of competitive strategy as well \nas persistence of ROIC by sector.  \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n-25 -20 -15 -10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\nEnterprise Value to Invested Capital\nROIC - WACC (Percent)\nr = 0.58\n"

The Russell 3000 tracks the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. public \ncompanies. By convention, we exclude certain industries because their accounting is different than the rest. \nData are also missing for some companies. These adjustments reduce our sample size to the range of roughly \n1,600 to 2,100 for each year. \nWe calculate ROIC two ways. The first is the traditional approach, where we derive NOPAT and invested capital \nfrom the financial statements that companies report. The second includes an adjustment that considers some \nfraction of research and development (R&D) and non-R&D selling, general, and administrative (non-R&D SG&A) \nexpense as intangible investments. We reflect these investments on the balance sheet and amortize them over \ntheir assumed asset lives. The percentage of R&D and non-R&D SG&A that are treated as an expense, as well \nas the asset lives, vary by industry.7 This adjustment increases NOPAT and investment (and by definition \ninvested capital) but leaves free cash flow unchanged. \nExhibit 2 shows the cross-sectional distributions of ROIC for the selected companies in the Russell 3000 from \n1990 to 2022. The shaded bars reflect the calculation using the traditional method, and the solid bars show the \nadjusted approach. The averages and medians are similar for the two distributions, but the adjusted method has \nfar fewer extreme values. The adjustments for intangible investments tend to pull ROICs toward the average.8  \nExhibit 2: Distributions of ROICs for the Russell 3000, 1990-2022 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate. \nExhibit 3 shows the time series of aggregate traditional and adjusted ROIC for the selected firms in the Russell \n3000 from 1990 to 2022. The annual average for the traditional ROIC calculation is 9.5 percent over the full \nperiod, slightly higher than the 9.2 percent for the adjusted ROIC. Further, the traditional calculation of ROIC \nhas a modestly lower standard deviation, a measure of dispersion, than that of adjusted ROIC. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n<(20)\n(20)-(15) (15)-(10) (10)-(5)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n25-30\n>30\nFrequency (Percent of Total)\nROIC (Percent)\nTraditional\nAdjusted\n"

Consistent with the analysis summarized in exhibits 2 and 3, we see that \nthe change produces results that are less diffuse. While the middle three quintiles are similar with or without the \nmodification, the median ROICs for the highest and lowest quintiles are much closer to the average following \nthe adjustment. Reflecting intangibles should also help allay concerns about high ROICs as the result of \nexcessive market power, the ability to set the price of a good or service above its marginal cost.9 \nExhibit 4: Median ROIC by Quintile, Traditional and Adjusted, for the Russell 3000, 1990-2022 \n \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global.  \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate; Truncated y-axis of traditional ROIC chart (left) for visualization. \nThe importance of the intangible adjustment varies significantly by industry. Some industries largely depend on \nintangible investments, such as R&D for drug development or advertising for building consumer brands. Other \nindustries are more reliant on tangible investments, and reckoning for intangibles has little impact on ROIC.  \nExhibit 5 shows ROICs by industry from 1990 to 2022, ranked from highest (left) to lowest (right) based on the \ntraditional ROIC calculation.

Public companies create value in total when the spread is positive. Exhibit \n6 shows aggregate adjusted ROIC, WACC, and ROIC \u2013 WACC for the chosen companies in the Russell 3000 \nfrom 1990 to 2022.  \nIn the last two decades or so, the spread dipped into negative territory following the recession in the early 2000s \nand during the Great Recession that ended in 2009. ROICs also dropped sharply in 2020 due to the brief \nrecession brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. But the response by central banks made WACC fall nearly in \nlockstep, which allowed the spread to remain relatively stable. ROIC \u2013 WACC reached a 30-year high in 2021, \nonly to fall sharply in 2022 as ROICs declined slightly and the cost of capital surged higher.      \nExhibit 6: Adjusted ROIC, WACC, and ROIC-WACC for the Russell 3000, 1990-2022 \n \nSource: FactSet; Counterpoint Global; Moody\u2019s; Aswath Damodaran; FRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate; Capital structure reflects book value of total long- and short-term debt and market \nvalue of equity; Cost of debt is the Moody's Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield; Cost of equity = yield on 10-year U.S. \nTreasury note + equity risk premium. \nEconomic profit, defined as ROIC \u2013 WACC times invested capital, translates value creation from percentages \nto dollars. For example, if ROIC is 12 percent, the WACC 7 percent, and a company has $1,000 in invested \ncapital, the economic profit is $50 ($50 = [0.12 \u2013 0.07] X $1,000).  \nExhibit 7 shows aggregate adjusted economic profit for the selected companies in the Russell 3000 from 1990 \nto 2022. The figures are in 2022 dollars to remove the effect of inflation and use average invested capital in each \nyear. Economic profit in 2022 was less than one-half that of 2021, although it remained healthy relative to history. \nExhibit 8 shows the distribution of the average annual economic profit by decile for companies in the Russell \n3000 from 2018-2022. The total average annual economic profit is $723 billion. The lowest decile had an average \nannual economic profit of -$270 billion, the top decile $890 billion, and the 8 deciles between them $103 billion. \nThe large values are in the extreme deciles. \nOne of the benefits of economic profit relative to ROIC is that it combines the ROIC to WACC spread with the \namount of capital the company can invest at that spread. To illustrate, two companies may have the same five \npercentage point positive spread between ROIC and WACC, but the company that can invest more at that \nspread will create a greater amount of value.     \n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nPercent\nROIC-WACC\nROIC\nWACC\n"

The reason is that a stock price reflects the market\u2019s expectations about a company\u2019s \nfuture financial results. Excess returns are the result of revisions in expectations. Of course, actual financial \nresults shape and reshape expectations. But the stock of a company with a high ROIC will not deliver attractive \nreturns if it fails to exceed expectations over time.    \nWe can examine the link between changes in ROIC and TSR to see how this plays out in the market. One \nstarting point is to ask what would happen if an investor simply bought the stocks of companies in the highest to \nlowest ROIC quintiles and held them for three years. The risk-adjusted returns since 1990 would have been \nsimilar for four of the five quintiles. The exception is the quintile with the lowest ROICs, which produced markedly \nlower TSRs than the others. A sensible explanation for this outcome is that the market is broadly effective at \ndiscerning the quality of businesses and valuing them accordingly.  \nThe next question is what happens when ROICs get better or worse over time. Exhibit 9 shows these results \nfrom 1990-2022. The vertical axis shows the ROICs of companies ranked from best to worst by quintile in the \nbeginning year. The horizontal axis shows the ROICs, also ranked from best to worst by quintile, in the ending \nyear. The body of the table is the TSRs for each transition combination over three years. For instance, companies \nthat started in the 4th quartile and ended in the 3rd delivered a compound annual TSR of 6 percent over 3 years.  \nExhibit 9: Annual 3-Year TSRs for Combinations of Beginning and Ending Quintiles, 1990-2022 \n  \n  \nEnding Quintile \n  \n  \n(Best) 5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n(Worst) 1 \nBeginning \nQuintile \n   (Best) 5   \n20% \n7% \n0% \n-4% \n-11% \n              4 \n25% \n14% \n6% \n0% \n-10% \n              3 \n28% \n18% \n10% \n2% \n-6% \n              2 \n28% \n20% \n14% \n6% \n-5% \n (Worst) 1   \n33% \n23% \n15% \n8% \n-3% \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate; Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \nThe results show what common sense suggests: Rising ROICs tend to be good for shareholders and falling \nROICs tend to be bad. For example, companies that started in the bottom quintile and ended in the top one \n(bottom left corner) generated TSRs of 33 percent. Companies that started in the top quintile and ended in the \nbottom one (upper right corner) generated TSRs of -11 percent.  \nThese results naturally prompt the question of the rate of transition from one quintile to another over time. Exhibit \n10 shows those results for 3-year periods from 1990 to 2022. The most common outcome for a company within \na starting quintile is to end up in the same quintile.  \n \n \n"

On the left is the average adjusted ROIC, 28 percent, for companies in the top quintile \nin 2019. On the right is the distribution of ROICs for that population of companies in 2022, along with the \ncompound annual TSRs from 2020 to 2022 by quintile. Note that the average of the distribution in 2022 is lower \nthan that for 2019. Investors in high ROIC companies should keep this chart in mind, recognizing that the \nchallenge is to find the companies that can defy expectations by maintaining, or even improving, their ROICs. \nExhibit 11: Annual TSRs for Companies that Start in the Highest Quintile of ROIC, 2019-2022 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nFrequency (Percent)\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nROIC Bin (Percent)\n>50\n40-50\n30-40\n20-30\n10-20\n0-10\n(10)-0\n(20)-(10)\n<(20)\nQ5 TSR= \n11.7%\nQ4 TSR= \n6.0%\nQ3 TSR= \n-8.5%\nQ2 TSR= \n-3.6%\nQ1 TSR= \n-15.7%\nAverage \nROIC\n"

All rights reserved. \n5711101 Exp. 6/30/2024 \n15\n \n \nWe also examined whether differentiation or cost leadership was more represented among the firms that \ndelivered high and sustained ROICs. We set a high bar by identifying only those companies that had ROICs in \nthe top quintile for ten straight years over the span of 1990 to 2022. There were 469 occurrences in total, with \nsome companies appearing multiple times. We then studied whether high NOPAT margins, or high invested \ncapital turnover, distinguished the companies from the pack (see the appendix for details). \nIt turns out the companies are above the average overall in both drivers of ROIC, but the contribution of NOPAT \nmargin was substantially more important. For example, of the 34 companies that made the list in 2022, the \naverage NOPAT margin was 2.7 times that of the universe, whereas the average invested capital turnover was \n1.5 times. This is consistent with prior research on sustainable excess returns.15    \nConclusion \nThere is an old adage that you have to spend money to make money. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is one \nway to measure spending money (invested capital) and making money (net operating profit after taxes). ROIC, \nin turn, informs us about the value of a business, which is the present value of future free cash flows. Following \nthe adage, free cash flow is the money you make minus what you spend to make it. The components of ROIC \ntranslate into the drivers of value. \nA company creates value when its ROIC is in excess of its cost of capital. Stated differently, a company, through \nits activities, makes one dollar worth of investment worth more than one dollar in market value. We show that \nthe market broadly appreciates this, especially when growth in the business is considered as an additional \nvariable. \nMeasuring ROIC accurately has become more of a challenge in recent decades as the result of the rise of \nintangible investments relative to tangible investments. Internal intangible investments appear as an expense \non the income statement but do not show up on the balance sheet, which means that earnings and invested \ncapital are understated.  \nTo correct for this, we capitalize intangible investments and amortize them over an estimate of their useful lives. \nA comparison between ROICs calculated the traditional way and adjusted for intangibles shows that the median \nand average figures are quite close for a large sample of U.S. public companies. What differs are the extremes. \nThe adjustment to ROIC has the effect of reducing dispersion, which means that very high and low ROICs move \ntoward the average of the population.  \nInvestors earn excess returns when they correctly anticipate revisions in expectations for a company\u2019s financial \nresults. In this spirit, we examine the relationship between changes in ROIC and total shareholder returns \n(TSRs). The broad pattern is that increases in ROIC are associated with attractive TSRs and decreases with \npoor TSRs. We also examined the movement of companies from one quintile of ROIC to another over three \nyears. Companies commonly end up in the same quintile in which they started, but those that meaningfully \nchange their ranking often provide opportunity for outsized returns. \nMarkets are akin to an ecosystem where investors fill various niches. Investors with a short-term horizon tend \nto focus on near-term financial metrics such as sales and earnings. Investors with a long-term horizon focus on \ncompetitive advantage and the size of the market opportunity.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n5711101 Exp. 6/30/2024 \n16\n \n \nROIC provides a glimpse into the generic strategies that companies pursue to create value. A differentiation \nstrategy entails pricing a good or service above the average of the industry and shows up as a high NOPAT/sales \nmargin. A cost leadership strategy means pricing below the industry average and is commonly supported by the \nefficient use of capital as measured by the ratio of sales/invested capital. We can break down each company\u2019s \nROIC by these two components and infer the pursued strategy. This insight can help guide strategic analysis. \nRegression toward the mean (RTM) is a powerful force in business and finance. We quantified the rate of RTM \nfor various sectors. Understanding RTM can offer insight into the appropriate set of expectations for a given \nbusiness and help explain why companies in certain sectors trade at higher valuations than those in other \nsectors, given the same spread between ROIC and WACC.  \nFinally, we looked at companies that delivered high and sustained ROICs and found that while they exceeded \ntheir peers in both NOPAT margin and invested capital turnover, NOPAT margin was a significantly more \nimportant driver. This suggests that companies that pursue a differentiation strategy have been more \nrepresented among companies delivering superior returns over time.    \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 29-31 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Mauboussin and Alfred Rappaport, Expectations Investing: Reading Stock Prices for Better Returns \n\u2013 Revised and Updated (New York: Columbia Business School Publishing, 2021).  \n7 We use the assumptions in Aneel Iqbal, Shivaram Rajgopal, Anup Srivastava, and Rong Zhao, \u201cValue of \nInternally Generated Intangible Capital,\u201d Working Paper, February 2022. \n8 Here\u2019s the way to think about it: For businesses with a high ROIC, the adjustment increases NOPAT and \ninvestment by the same amount in a given year but also captures all past intangible investments net of \namortization. The result is a small increase in NOPAT and a relatively large increase in invested capital. For \nbusinesses with a negative ROIC, the adjustment ends up being a relatively large increase in NOPAT and a \ncomparatively small increase in invested capital. For a more detailed explanation, see Mauboussin and \nCallahan, \u201cReturn on Invested Capital,\u201d 33-34. \n9 For examples of concern, see Jan De Loecker, Jan Eeckhout, Gabriel Unger, \u201cThe Rise of Market Power and \nthe Macroeconomic Implications,\u201d Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 135, No. 2, May 2020, 561-644; Jan \nEeckhout, The Profit Paradox: How Thriving Firms Threaten the Future of Work (Princeton, NJ: Princeton \nUniversity Press, 2021); Gauti B.

For an example of allaying that concern, see Meghana Ayyagari, Asli \nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Vojislav Maksimovic, \u201cThe Rise of Star Firms: Intangible Capital and Competition,\u201d Review \nof Financial Studies, forthcoming.  \n10 To state the obvious, smaller changes in ROIC levels lead to more movement among the middle three quintiles \nbecause the range of ROICs in those quintiles is much smaller than it is in either the highest or lowest quintiles. \nCompanies in the extreme quintiles can have large changes in ROIC and remain in their respective quintiles, \nbut relatively small changes will bump a company in the middle quintiles up or down.   \n11 Joan Magretta, Understanding Michael Porter: The Essential Guide to Competition and Strategy (Boston, MA: \nHarvard Business Review Press, 2012), 114-115. \n12 Michael J.
