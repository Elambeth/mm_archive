We always, of \ncourse, hope to earn more money in the short-term. But when short-term and long-term \nconflict, widening the moat must take precedence. If a management makes bad decisions in \norder to hit short-term earnings targets . . . no amount of subsequent brilliance will overcome \nthe damage that has been inflicted.  \n \nWarren E. Buffett \nBerkshire Hathaway Letter to Shareholders (2005) 1 \n \nWall Street has a tendency to overemphasize short-term benefits at the expense of long-term \nbenefits . . . There is a reward given to pursue short-term actions that provide a short-term \nbenefit at the expense of long-term value to your company. \n \nDoug Geoga \nHyatt Hotels 2 \n \nShort Termism  \n \nYou see it all the time: a baseball fan\u2019s mood rises or falls based on a ten-game stretch in a \nlong season; an investment manager is heralded or derided for a quarter\u2019s results; investors \ndump, or euphorically buy, a stock after an earnings release. These scenarios share a \ncommon feature\u2014a heavy focus on short-term results. In every case, a short-term emphasis \ncan hinder intelligent long-term decisions and perspective. \n \nLaments about short termism come from many quarters, yet no person or group appears able \nto stop its inexorable pull. But the swell in short-term thinking presents an opportunity as well \nas a challenge. Individuals who can, under the proper conditions, think and act with a long-\nterm perspective stand to benefit from the short-term focus of others. \n \nCompanies, investors, and investment managers are the main actors involved in capital \nmarkets short termism. The interaction between these groups, their respective and often \nconflicting incentives, and today\u2019s information torrent all combine to shape behavior.        \n \nThe Causes . . .  \n \nBefore discussing how to take advantage of short termism, it\u2019s worth discussing why a \nmyopic view is so prevalent today. Doing so, we can point to at least four sources, which are \nnot mutually exclusive: \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \nPAGE 2 \n \nLEGG MASON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \nIncentives. That individuals respond to incentives is one of the most powerful lessons in \neconomics. In recent decades, three noteworthy changes shifted incentives, encouraging a short-\nterm focus. First, many companies revamped executive compensation. Second, investors \nincreasingly outsourced investment decisions to external advisors, instead of making the \ndecisions themselves. Finally, many investment firms changed their ownership structure from \npartnerships to financial conglomerates. \n \nWe will discuss these incentive shifts in detail to observe how they prompted a change in \nbehavior. Also, the continuous interaction of companies, investors, and investment managers \nmeans that one group\u2019s behavioral change can, and often does, affect the others.  \n \nPsychology.  A fascinating and relevant line of research addresses the effects of stress. For most \nanimals, physical threats trigger the stress response. If and when the threat passes, the animal \nsettles back to a balanced state. Humans generally face psychological stress, though we still \nrespond physically by pumping blood, releasing adrenaline, sharpening senses, shutting down \nlong-term operations like digestion, reproduction, and the immune system. The problem for \nhumans: psychological stress is often chronic. As a result, the body finds itself in crisis every day. \nStress\u2019s normal symptoms\u2014high blood pressure, reproductive problems, and frequent illness\u2014\nreflect this mostly-human condition. \n \nMoreover, stress mobilizes you for the short term and ignores the long term. Just as there\u2019s no \nuse worrying about next week if a lion is chasing you, there\u2019s no need to consider three-year \ninvestment returns if you\u2019re likely to get fired for poor three-month results. 3 Heightened stress \nundoubtedly encourages a short-term mindset.  \n \nPsychology also comes into play when individuals intend to make good decisions but fall prey to \ncertain decision-making pitfalls, including the availability bias, the recency bias, and loss \naversion. We will point out how these biases undermine the decision making of each group.  \n \nInformation.  The media, companies, and financial advisors churn out an extraordinary amount of \ninformation every day. Naturally, an investor requires information to make decisions. But \ninvestors must also make a crucial distinction between noise and signal.  \n \nConsider the metaphor of a series of coin tosses. Assuming a fair coin, the long-term signal is an \nevenly-split ratio between heads and tails, revealing itself with repeated trials. However, a short \nseries of tosses may show a ratio vastly different than fifty-fifty. Investors operating in the realm of \nnoise have a hard time making reasoned long-term judgments. \n \nThe media, Wall Street analysts, and other financial pundits are paid to generate information. But \nthe vast majority of it is noise. As Nassim Taleb puts it, \u201cPeople do not realize that the media is \npaid to get your attention. For a journalist, silence rarely surpasses any word.\u201d 4 More information \ncreates more noise and more market reaction, without generating insight or value. \n \nRate of change.  The apparent acceleration of the rate of change for businesses creates a final \nsource of shorter time horizons. For example, the average asset life in corporate America \ndeclined by a third in the last thirty years or so. Said differently, a chief financial officer today \nneeds to generate an appropriate rate of return over roughly ten years, while his mid-1970s \npredecessor could wait fifteen years.  \n \nFurther, empirical studies suggest U.S. companies face a shrinking period of sustainable \ncompetitive advantage\u2014a shift that is not limited to technology companies. 5 On one level a \nshorter time horizon makes sense, but markets still appear to have too much needless activity. \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \nPAGE 3 \n \nLEGG MASON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \nThe Costs . . .  \n \nWhy should we care if the world is more short-term oriented? First, more activity is costly. \nResearch shows that active trading, which economists often attribute to overconfidence, leads to \nlower portfolio returns. 6 The resulting performance degradation reflects transaction and market \nimpact costs. Estimates suggest these costs are 70 basis points a year for the average mutual \nfund\u2014with a higher total for active traders and a lower amount for less active funds. 7  \n \nNext, in a probabilistic field like investing, a short-term focus doesn\u2019t allow you to capture the \nsystem\u2019s signal. We can liken this to predicting a baseball team\u2019s full season record based on a \nsample of a few games. Humans, as natural pattern seekers, have a well-documented tendency \nto believe that a small series of numbers, or results, reflect the larger series. Psychologists show \nhow this belief leads to suboptimal decisions. 8 \n \nFinally, corporate managers who make decisions to bolster short-term results at the expense of \nlong-term performance risk damaging the value of the businesses they run. Trade loading is a \ngood example of this behavior. In the 1980s some cigarette manufacturers sold excessive \ninventory to their customers in advance of cigarette price increases. The extra volume goosed \nshort-term earnings but forfeited future sales, accelerated excise tax payments, extended \ncustomer payment terms, and provided customers with a stale product. 9 Similar behavior \ncontinues today. As Buffett suggests in the opening quotation, decisions to make short-term \ntargets at the expense of a business\u2019s long-term competitive position can inflict irreversible \ndamage.  \n \nThe Caveats . . .  \n \nBefore continuing, two points merit attention. First, the short-term actions of market participants \nremain distinct from the horizon of the market itself. To understand the market\u2019s time horizon, you \nneed to look directly at asset prices. Studies of asset prices show the market reflects ten or more \nyears of future cash flows in today\u2019s prices. For example, the expected dividends over the next \nfive years account for less than 20 percent of the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In \nsum, investors make short-term bets on what are ultimately long-term outcomes. \n \nSecond, not all market participants should be long-term oriented all of the time. Indeed, there are \nsuccessful short-term investment strategies. And if all investors were long-term oriented, markets \nwould lose diversity\u2014a crucial ingredient in market efficiency. 10 The problem arises when \ninvestors confuse their objective with their strategies. Too often, investors mix an objective to \ndeliver superior long-term returns with strategies and behaviors rooted in short termism.  \n \nWe now turn to the three groups, and discuss the changes they have seen and what those \nchanges mean for a shortening time horizon.  \n \nCorporations   \n \nAs early as the 1930s, researchers pointed out potential conflicts of interest between professional \nbusiness managers and the owners, or shareholders. 11 Michael Jensen and William Meckling \nformalized the idea of agency costs in a famous 1976 paper, where they noted, \u201cthere is good \nreason to believe that the agent [manager] will not always act in the best interests of the principal \n[owner].\u201d 12 In plain words, what may be good for the executive may not be good for the \nshareholders.  \n \nThough it often appears in today\u2019s headlines, the chasm between CEO wealth and shareholder \nwealth is by no means a new topic. In 1990, Jensen and Kevin Murphy wrote, \u201cOur analysis of \nperformance pay and top-management incentives for more than 2,000 CEOs in three samples \nspanning five decades indicates that the relation between CEO wealth and shareholder wealth is \nsmall and has fallen by an order of magnitude in the last 50 years.\u201d 13  \n"

      "text": " \nPAGE 4 \n \nLEGG MASON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \nConcerns over agency costs waned somewhat in the 1980s, as many observers believed an \nactive market for corporate control would mitigate these costs. The active market for corporate \ncontrol also gave rise to a major shift in executive compensation: boards started tying \nmanagement pay directly to the stock price. Exhibit 1 shows this evolution over the past twenty \nyears or so. In the mid-1980s, virtually no chief executive pay was tied to the stock price. By the \nmid-1990s, that ratio\u2014fueled by employee stock option grants\u2014surpassed 40 percent. Today, \napproximately 60 percent of CEO pay is market-related. \n \nExhibit 1: CEO Pay is More Tied to the Stock Price than Ever Before \n \nSource: Brian J. Hall and Jeffrey B. Liebman, \u201cAre CEOs Really Paid Like Bureaucrats?\u201d NBER Working Paper 6213, October 1997; \u201c2004 CEO \nCompensation Survey and Trends,\u201d Wall Street Journal/Mercer Human Resource Consulting, May 2005; LMCM estimates. \n \nWith their paychecks linked to stock price performance, CEOs quite naturally sought to maximize \nthe value of their stock price. Along the way, many of them have gone badly awry by fixating on \nthe single metric they believe drives value: earnings per share growth. This fixation evolved \ndespite voluminous evidence in the academic literature showing the tenuous link between EPS \ngrowth and value creation. 14 \n \nWe believe the focus on EPS growth results from what psychologists call the availability bias, or \nthe tendency to base assessments on widely-available, versus relevant, information. A financial \nexecutive survey by John Graham, Campbell Harvey, and Shiva Rajgopal provides sobering \nevidence of the laser-like focus on EPS. 15 The executives report the relative importance of \n\u201cearnings are in a class by themselves\u201d for financial reporting. The executives cite four reasons: \n \n1. Investors need a simple metric that summarizes corporate performance. \n2. EPS gets the broadest distribution and coverage by the media. \n3. Focus on EPS makes the analyst\u2019s task easier. \n4. Analysts evaluate a firm\u2019s progress based on whether a company hits consensus EPS. \n \nA focus on EPS may not be bad because EPS growth and value creation are clearly not mutually \nexclusive. But a more alarming survey finding is that almost 80 percent of the executives said \nthey would give up economic value in exchange for smooth earnings. Clearly, shareholders do \nnot benefit from the trade of accounting results for value creation over the long term. \n \nIs the managerial focus on EPS a problem? We think so. Our concerns are based on a number of \nresearch findings and practical considerations. \n \nFirst, academic research shows companies that tied CEO compensation more closely to the \nvalue of the stock and option holdings in the 1990s saw greater use of discretionary accruals to \nmanipulate EPS.16 The researchers define accruals as the difference between earnings and cash \nflow from operations. While the researchers don\u2019t dismiss stock-based incentives, they conclude \nthat \u201chigh-powered incentives based on stock price performance seem likely to work best when  \n1985 \n2005 \n1995\nTied to stock \nmarket \n43%\nTied to stock \nmarket \n   1% \nTied to stock \nmarket \n60% \n"

(See Exhibit 2.) \nTransient institutions have high turnover and small stakes. Quasi-indexers have low turnover and \nsmall stakes. Low turnover and large investment stakes characterize dedicated institutions.  \n \nExhibit 2: Percentage Breakdown of Institutional Investor Categories \n \nQuasi-indexers  \n \n61 % \nTransients \n \n \n31 \nDedicated  \n \n \n  8 \nTotal \n \n                        100% \n \nSource: Brian Bushee, \u201cIdentifying and Attracting the \u2018Right\u2019 Investors: Evidence on the Behavior of Institutional Investors,\u201d Journal of Applied \nCorporate Finance, Vol. 16, 4, Fall 2004, 28-35. \n \nBushee\u2019s analysis shows that companies with active investor relations efforts, including frequent \nearnings guidance and news, attract transient investors. These investors, however, are quick to \nsell when a string of favorable earnings breaks. Further, his research suggests firms with a large \npercentage of transient investors will more likely manage EPS by cutting research and \ndevelopment spending.  \n   \nWhile the causality may not be crystal clear\u2014companies that manage EPS attract transient \ninvestors or transient investors compel companies to manage EPS\u2014the evidence suggests \ncompanies kick off the feedback loop. Disclosure policies above and beyond legal requirements \nare a corporate choice. Bushee summarizes by suggesting, \u201cperhaps the most important step that \nmanagers could take would be to discourage transient ownership by refusing to manage (that is, \nsmooth) reported earnings.\u201d \n \nNotwithstanding the substantial costs associated with issuing earnings guidance, two-thirds of \ncompanies continue to do so today. 18 While guidance is perceived to enhance communication, \ncompanies also point to lower volatility and peer group participation as reasons to offer forecasts.  \n \nThe empirical results, however, do not square with corporate perception. A recent McKinsey \nstudy failed to find any improvement in valuation, shareholder returns, or volatility as a result of \nguidance. 19 Further, the researchers found when companies start earnings guidance, their \nstock\u2019s trading volume increases, consistent with elevated interest of transient investors. The \nstudy\u2019s authors instead advocate disclosing information that relates to the underlying business \nvalue drivers. \n \nAcademics also found that companies engaging in frequent earnings guidance will more likely \nsacrifice long-term growth in order to satisfy short-term earnings objectives. This analysis focuses \nprimarily on changes in R&D spending. 20   \n \nResearch also shows companies ceasing EPS guidance tend to have weak earnings and stock \nprice performance. The analysis suggests poor performance more likely motivates managers to \ngive up guidance rather than other \u201caltruistic\u201d reasons. The study concludes elimination of \nguidance hurts prices more because of a negative signal about future financial performance than \nbecause of the guidance cessation itself. 21 \n \nFinally, a recent study shows the stock market premium for companies meeting or slightly beating \nconsensus EPS has vanished in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley world. This finding holds with the view \ninvestors are more skeptical of firms meeting or beating EPS estimates subsequent to the wave \nof corporate scandals in the early 2000s. 22 \n"

      "text": " \nPAGE 6 \n \nLEGG MASON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \n \nIn summary, corporations today focus more on the short term than they did in the past. This is \npartially appropriate, as the shift in the global competitive landscape has reduced asset lives. \nFurther, companies focused on the short term may be willing to face and address problems on a \ntimelier basis than a company focused on the long term. 23  \n \nIronically, many of today\u2019s issues reflect unintended consequences of trying to minimize agency \ncosts. Starting earnestly in the 1980s, companies recognized the importance of delivering \nshareholder returns. The result has been a massive increase in the percentage of CEO pay tied to \nstock price results. But rather than internalizing the principles of shareholder value, many \nmanagers\u2014because of the availability bias\u2014defaulted to a near-messianic focus on EPS growth. 24 \nThe companies most focused on earnings growth attracted transient investors who, in turn, \ndemanded more guidance and growth, fueling an untenable cycle.  \n \nInvestment Management \n \nCorporate finance researchers have long recognized the importance of agency costs. \nSurprisingly, academics have not fully recognized agency costs in the investment business\u2014\nessentially the role of financial institutions. 25 Clearly, the interests of investors and investment \nmanagers are not perfectly aligned, and evidence suggests principal/agent relationships have an \nimpact on asset pricing beyond what standard models capture. 26 \n \nThe dearth of discussion about the delegated agent may reflect the relative recency of the issue. \n(See Exhibit 3.) In 1950, individuals directly controlled over 90 percent of corporate equities. \nToday, individuals hold less than 40 percent of equities with the bulk now held by mutual funds, \npension funds, and insurance companies.

A logical place \nto start is the distinction between the investment profession and business. 27 The investment \nprofession is dedicated to delivering superior results for fund shareholders; practitioners tend to \nbe long-term oriented, contrarian, and patient.

Specifically, problems occur when delivering \ninvestment returns takes a back seat to generating fees for the investment firm. Marketing takes \nprecedence over markets. Industry luminaries, including Jack Bogle and David Swensen, have \nargued this point forcefully. 28  \n \nBogle marshals two pieces of evidence to show the detrimental effects of this shift for fund \nholders. He starts by noting one proxy for differentiating a marketing firm from a management firm \nis the number of funds they offer. Using data prepared by Fidelity Investments covering 54 of the \nlargest investment firms (representing about 85 percent of the industry\u2019s assets) from 1994 to \n2003, Bogle compared the overall investment performance of the firms with fewer funds versus \nthose with an extensive offering. (See Exhibit 4.) He found the focused firms performed much \nbetter, and that 36 of the 37 lowest ranked spots belonged to marketing-oriented organizations. \n \nExhibit 4: Number of Funds versus Investment Returns \n \nShading highlights firms that manage fifteen or fewer funds \n \n \nSource: Fidelity Investments.

Equal-weighted outperformance rankings ignore the impact of sales charges and include only A-class shares. \n \nAccording to Bogle\u2019s analysis, ownership of investment firms has also been important in shaping \nincentives. Of the 30 largest mutual fund companies today (based on year-end 2005 assets), only \nfour are private. Of the other 26, financial conglomerates own 19 and the other 7 are publicly \nheld. Large financial conglomerates tend to focus more on generating earnings than do the \nprivate investment firms that focus more on the profession. The data here also seem to strongly \nsupport this notion: the vast majority of the best-performing fund families were privately held, and \npublic firms sat in 32 of the bottom 34 slots. 29 (See Exhibit 5.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFirm\nEqual-Weighted \nOutperformance\nNo. of \nFunds\nFirm\nEqual-Weighted \nOutperformance\nNo. of \nFunds\nFirm\nEqual-Weighted \nOutperformance\nNo. of \nFunds\nDodge & Cox\n98\n4\nWaddell & Reed\n61\n45\nEaton Vance\n49\n73\nFirst Eagle\n97\n5\nUSAA\n61\n31\nMorgan Stanley Adv.\n49\n50\nCalamos\n91\n8\nOppenheimer\n60\n48\nGoldman Sachs\n49\n34\nSo.

      "text": " \nPAGE 9 \n \nLEGG MASON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \n \nAsset pricing models generally assume either rational investors or a no-arbitrage assumption to \nattain market efficiency. While neither case provides fully for the role of agency costs, intriguing \nevidence suggests agent behavior may play an important role in asset pricing. \n \nOne line of thinking follows the relationship between the financial institutions garnering the lion\u2019s \nshare of investor dollars and asset performance. The data show the outperformance of large \ncapitalization stocks from 1980 to 2000 coincides directly with the rise of large financial institutions. \nThe researchers argue the compositional shift in asset management increased the demand for \nlarge capitalization stocks and decreased the demand for small capitalization stocks, potentially \naccounting for 230 basis points of annual return premium for the large cap stocks. 32  \n \nThe 2000s, of course, show a much different picture with much of the incremental asset growth \ncoming in hedge funds. Estimates suggest the number of hedge funds has doubled since 2000, \nwhile the industry increased assets under management by $1 trillion. The 2000s have also seen \nsmall capitalization stocks sharply outperform large capitalization stocks; this relative gain, no \ndoubt, also reflects the overvaluation of the large cap stocks in 2000.  \n \nKeeping with the idea that the structure of the investment industry shapes investment outcomes, \nit is intriguing to note 43 percent of hedge fund equity holdings are in stocks with market \ncapitalizations of $5 billion or less (versus less than 26 percent for mutual funds) and almost 60 \npercent of hedge fund assets are in companies with market caps $10 billion or less (compared \nwith 37 percent for mutual funds). 33 Has the rise in hedge funds played a role in distorting the \nmarkets, just as the large institutions did in the 1990s? \n \nInvestors \n \nJack Bogle provides what may be the most sobering statistic in the investment industry: from \n1983-2003, index funds tracking the S&P 500 returned 12.8 percent and the average mutual fund \ngained 10.0 percent annually. Meanwhile, the average investor only earned 6.3 percent annual \nreturns. 34 This seemingly impossible result is attributable to one crucial variable: market timing. \nThe Bogle data refer to average percentage changes, not dollar-weighted changes. When you \nconsider the extraordinary proclivity for investors to invest in the wrong place at the wrong time, \nthe data start to make sense. \n \nFor example, at the height of the technology and telecom bubble in the first quarter of 2000, \ninvestors poured a record $140 billion into growth funds while pulling $40 billion out of value \nfunds. In the subsequent five years, value funds substantially outperformed growth funds. 35   \n \nUsing over twenty years of market data, Evergreen Capital Management paired mutual fund flows \nwith a valuation measure to generate buy and sell signals. High inflows and high valuation \ntriggers a sell signal, while large outflows and cheap valuations mean buy. Following a sell \nsignal\u2014across various investment styles\u2014the return of the investment strategy underperformed \nthe S&P 500 by an average of 490 basis points over the subsequent two-year period. Buy signals \ngenerated an even more impressive 870 basis points of excess returns in two years. As \nnoteworthy, the sell signal was reliable nearly 80 percent of the time, while the buy signal was \naccurate over 90 percent of the time. 36   \n  \nWhy do investors make this mistake? The most likely explanation is the recency bias, which says \nindividuals tend to extrapolate recent outcomes without giving full weight to the full time series or \nprevailing circumstances. This bias defines one of the most reliable sources of inefficiency in the \nmarket. Recent academic research, spanning twenty years of data, shows the buying and selling \npatterns of individual investors provide a hard-to-beat contrary indicator. More specifically, \nresearchers found heavy buying leads to above-average short-term results and below-market \nreturns in the subsequent year. The mirror image holds true for stocks individuals sell. 37    \n \n"

      "text": " \nPAGE 10 \n \nLEGG MASON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \nTime will tell, but we can see evidence for recency bias and questionable investor flows in today\u2019s \nmarkets. (See Exhibit 7.) Funds dedicated to retail investors are seeing strong inflows in the \nsectors that have done well in the past five years, while interest in the groups that have done \npoorly is sparse. As Bill Miller noted, \u201cPeople want to buy today what they should have bought 5 \nor 6 years ago; call it the 5 year psychological cycle.\u201d 38  \n \nExhibit 7: The Recency Bias in Action? \n \n \nNote: All Data as of 3/31/06 \n \nSource: Bloomberg and S&P. \n  \nTaking Advantage of Short Termism \n \nNow we have a clear picture of why short-term thinking pervades investing. First, competition is \naccelerating, requiring companies to be more nimble. Second, psychological factors, including the \navailability bias and the recency bias, encourage suboptimal behavior. Third, as the nature of \nexecutive compensation and the structure of the investment industry have changed, so too have \nincentives. Companies fixate more on short-term EPS, often to the detriment of long-term value, \nand some investment managers prioritize asset gathering over investment results. Finally, the \ncost of activity has dropped: investors can move assets around with less friction today than at any \ntime in the past. \n \nSo how can an investor take advantage of short termism? One approach focuses on time \narbitrage. Time horizon is a crucial consideration in any probabilistic field. In these systems, \nshort-term results show mostly noise\u2014the noise-to-signal ratio is very high. Over time, the signal \nreveals itself, and the noise-to-signal ratio drops. Short-term investors dwell mostly in the world of \nnoise.  \n \nLet\u2019s go back to our simple coin-tossing example to demonstrate this point. Exhibit 8\u2019s left panel \nis the result of a 20-toss trial, and shows that 35 percent of the tosses came up heads. (We \nsimulated these results with a random number generator). The panel on the right continues with \nthe next 80 tosses in the series, and shows that the ratio settles very close to 50 percent over 100 \nflips. Even though we know the long-term signal is 50 percent, short-term noise can deviate \nsubstantially from long-term signal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLast 5 year \nannual gain\nRydex Weighting\nS&P 500 \nWeighting \nEnergy\nPrecious Metals\nTechnology\nFinancials\nOverweight\nUnderweight\n12.5%\n25.4%\n27.2%\n18.9%\n10.2%\n0.6%\n-0.5%\n2.8%\n16.0%\n7.2%\n2.9%\n21.1%\n"
