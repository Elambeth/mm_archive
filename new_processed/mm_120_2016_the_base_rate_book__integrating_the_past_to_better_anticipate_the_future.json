As a result, investing requires a clear sense of \nwhat\u2019s priced in today and possible future results.   \n \n The natural and intuitive way to create forecasts is to focus on an issue, gather information, search for \nevidence based on our experience, and extrapolate with some adjustment. This is what psychologists call \nthe \u201cinside view.\u201d It is common for the inside view to lead to a forecast that is too optimistic. \n \n Another way to make a forecast is to consider the outcomes of a relevant reference class. This is called \nthe \u201coutside view.\u201d Rather than emphasizing differences, as the inside view does, the outside view relies \non similarity. Using the outside view can be unnatural because you have to set aside your own \ninformation and experience as well as find and appeal to an appropriate reference class, or base rate.    \n \n Most executives and investors rely on their memory of prior instances as a basis for comparison. For \nexample, they may deem this private equity deal similar to that prior deal, and hence assume the return \non investment will be similar. An appropriate reference class is one that has a sample size that is \nsufficient to be robust but is similar enough to the class you are examining to be relevant.    \n \n Research in psychology shows that the most accurate forecasts are a thoughtful blend of the inside and \nthe outside views. Here\u2019s a helpful guide: If skill determines the outcome, you can rely more on the \ninside view. If luck plays a large role, you should place more weight on the outside view.  \n \n Regression toward the mean is a tricky concept that most investors believe in but few fully understand. \nThe concept says that outcomes that are far from average will be followed by outcomes with an expected \nvalue closer to the average. Examining correlations allows us to not only acknowledge the role of \nregression toward the mean, but also to understand its pace. The data in this book not only offer a basis \nfor an assessment of the rate of regression toward the mean, but also document the mean, or average, \nto which results regress.  \n \n This book provides the base rates of corporate performance for sales growth, gross profitability (gross \nprofits/assets), operating leverage, operating profit margin, earnings growth, and cash flow return on \ninvestment (CFROI\u00ae\r). In most cases, the data go back to 1950 and include dead companies. It also \nexamines stocks that have declined or risen sharply, and shows the subsequent price performance based \non how the stocks screen on momentum, valuation, and quality. \n \n Integrating the outside view allows an executive or investor to improve the quality of his or her forecast. It \nalso serves as a valuable reality check on the claims of others.  \n \n This report is the result of a deep collaboration with our HOLT team. HOLT\u00ae aims to remove the vagaries \nof accounting in order to allow comparison of corporate performance across a portfolio, a market, or a \nuniverse (cross sectional) as well as over time (longitudinal). \n \n                                                 \n \n\r CFROI\n\u00ae is a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding the United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse \nGroup AG or its affiliates. \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n5 \nIntroduction  \n \nThe objective of a fundamental investor is to find a gap between the financial performance implied by an asset \nprice and the results that will ultimately be revealed. A useful analogy is pari-mutuel betting in horse racing. \nThe odds provide the probability that a horse will win (implied performance) and the running of the race \ndetermines the outcome (actual performance). The goal is not to pick the winner of the race but rather the \nhorse that has odds that are mispriced relative to its likelihood of winning.  \n \nAs a result, investing requires a clear sense of what\u2019s priced in today and possible future results. Today\u2019s \nstock price, for example, combines a company\u2019s past financial performance with expectations of how the \ncompany will perform in the future. Market psychology also comes into play. The fundamental analyst has to \nhave a sense of a company\u2019s future performance to invest intelligently.    \n \nThere is a natural and intuitive approach to creating a forecast of any kind. We focus on an issue, gather \ninformation, search for evidence based on our experience, and extrapolate with some adjustment. \nPsychologists call this approach the \u201cinside view.\u201d  \n \nAn important feature of the inside view is that we dwell on what is unique about the situation.2 Indeed, Daniel \nGilbert, a psychologist at Harvard University, suggests that \u201cwe tend to think of people as more different from \none another than they actually are.\u201d3 Likewise, we think of the things we are trying to forecast as being more \nunique than they are. The inside view commonly leads to a forecast that is too optimistic, whether it\u2019s the likely \nsuccess of a new business venture, the cost and time it will take to build a bridge, or when a term paper will \nbe ready to be submitted.  \n \nThe \u201coutside view\u201d considers a specific forecast in the context of a larger reference class. Rather than \nemphasizing differences, as the inside view does, the outside view relies on similarity. The outside view asks, \n\u201cWhat happened when others were in this situation?\u201d This approach is also called \u201creference class forecasting.\u201d \nPsychologists have shown that our forecasts improve when we thoughtfully incorporate the outside view.4  \n \nAnalysis of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) provides a good example of these contrasting approaches. The \nexecutives at the companies that are merging will dwell on the strategic strength of the combined entities and \nthe synergies they expect. The uniqueness of the combined businesses is front and center in the minds of the \ndealmakers, who almost always feel genuinely good about the deal. That\u2019s the inside view. \n \nThe outside view asks not about the details of a specific deal but rather how all deals tend to do. Historically, \nabout 60 percent of deals have failed to create value for the acquiring company.5 If you know nothing about a \nspecific M&A deal, the outside view would have you assume a success rate similar to all deals. \n \nConsidering the outside view is useful but most executives and investors fail to do so. Dan Lovallo, Carmina \nClarke, and Colin Camerer, academics who study decision making, examined how executives make strategic \nchoices and found that they frequently rely either on a single analogy or a handful of cases that come to \nmind.6 Investors likely do the same.  \n \nUsing an analogy or a small sample of cases from memory has the benefit of being easy. But the cost is that \nit prevents a decision maker from properly incorporating the outside view.  \n \nYet not all instances in a reference class are equally informative. For instance, M&A deals financed with cash \ntend to do better than those funded with equity. Therefore, a proper analogy, or set of cases, may be a better \nmatch with the current decision than a broad base rate. You trade sample size for specificity.   \n"

This is a common approach that substantially over-represents the \ninside view. As a result, it frequently yields assessments that are too optimistic. \n \n\u201cCase-based decision theory,\u201d the bottom left corner, reflects instances when an executive recalls a handful of \ncase studies that seem similar to the relevant decision. The executive assesses how comparable the cases are \nto the focal decision and weights the cases appropriately. \n \nThe top right corner is reference class forecasting.14 Here, a decision maker considers an unbiased reference \nclass, determines the distribution of that reference class, makes an estimate of the outcome for the focal \ndecision, and then corrects the intuitive forecast based on the reference class. The decision maker weights \nequally all of the events in the reference class.   \n \nLovallo, Clarke, and Camerer advocate \u201csimilarity-based forecasting,\u201d the bottom right corner, which starts \nwith an unbiased reference class but assigns more weight to the cases that are similar to the focal problem \nwithout discarding the cases that are less relevant. Done correctly, this approach is the best of both worlds as \nit considers a large reference class as well as a means to weight relevance. \n   \nThe scientists ran a pair of experiments to test the empirical validity of their approach. In one, they asked \nprivate equity investors to consider a current deal, including key steps to success, performance milestones, \nand the expected rate of return.

Every subject wrote a rate of return for the focal project that \nwas equal to or higher than the comparable projects.  \n \nOver 80 percent of subjects who had higher forecasts for the focal project revised down their forecasts when \ngiven the opportunity. The prompt to consider the outside view tempered their estimates of the rate of return \nfor the deal under consideration. It is not hard to imagine similar results for corporate executives or investors in \npublic markets. \n \nIf the outside view is so useful, why do so few forecasters use it? There are a couple of reasons. Integrating \nthe outside view means less reliance on the inside view. We are reluctant to place less weight on the inside \nview because it reflects the information we have gathered as well as our experience. Further, we don\u2019t always \nhave access to the statistics of the appropriate reference class. As a result, even if we want to incorporate the \noutside view we do not have the data to do so. \n \nThis book provides a deep, empirical repository for the outside view, or base rates, for a number of the key \ndrivers of corporate performance. These include sales growth, gross profitability, operating profit margins, net \nincome growth, and rates of fade for cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae). It also offers data for how \nstocks perform following big moves down or up versus the stock market.  \n \nHow to Combine the Inside and Outside Views  \n \nDaniel Kahneman, a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002, wrote a paper with his \ncolleague Amos Tversky called \u201cOn the Psychology of Prediction.\u201d The paper, published in Psychological \nReview in 1973, argues that there are three types of information relevant to a statistical prediction: the base \nrate (outside view), the specifics about the case (inside view), and the relative weights you should assign to \neach.7 \n \nOne way to determine the relative weighting of the outside and inside views is based on where the activity lies \non the luck-skill continuum.8 Imagine a continuum where luck alone determines results on one end and where \nskill solely defines outcomes on the other end (see Exhibit 2). A blend of luck and skill reflects the results of \nmost activities, and the relative contributions of luck and skill provide insight into the weighting of the outside \nversus the inside view. \n \nFor reference, the exhibit shows where professional sports leagues fall on the continuum based on one \nseason. The National Basketball Association is the furthest from luck and the National Hockey League is the \nclosest to it.  \n \nExhibit 2: The Luck-Skill Continuum \n \nSource: Michael J.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n8 \nFor activities where skill dominates, the inside view should receive the greatest weight. Suppose you first listen \nto a song played by a concert pianist followed by a tune played by a novice. Playing music is predominantly a \nmatter of skill, so you can base the prediction of the quality of the next piece played by each musician on the \ninside view. The outside view has little or no bearing. \n \nBy contrast, when luck dominates the best prediction of the next outcome should stick closely to the base rate. \nFor example, money management has a lot of luck, especially in the short run. So if a fund has a particularly \ngood year, a reasonable forecast for the subsequent year would be a result closer to the average of all funds.  \n \nThere are two analytical concepts that can help you improve your judgment. The first is an equation that allows \nyou to estimate true skill:9 \n \nEstimated true skill = grand average + shrinkage factor (observed average \u2013 grand average) \n \nThe shrinkage factor has a range of zero to 1.0. Zero indicates complete regression toward the mean and 1.0 \nimplies no regression toward the mean at all.10 In this equation, the shrinkage factor tells us how much we \nshould regress the results toward the mean, and the grand average tells us the mean to which we should \nregress. \n   \nHere is an example to make this concrete. Assume that you want to estimate the true skill of a mutual fund \nmanager based on an annual result. The grand average would be the average return for all mutual funds in a \nsimilar category, adjusted for risk. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s eight percent. The observed average would be the fund\u2019s \nresult. We\u2019ll assume 12 percent. In this case, the shrinkage factor is close to zero, reflecting the high dose of \nluck in short-term results for mutual fund managers. You will use a shrinkage factor for one-year risk-adjusted \nexcess return of .10. The estimate of the manager\u2019s true skill based on these inputs is 8.4 percent, calculated \nas follows: \n \n8.4% = 8% + .10(12% - 8%) \n \nThe second concept, intimately related to the first, is how to come up with an estimate for the shrinkage factor. \nIt turns out that the correlation coefficient, r, a measure of the degree of linear relationship between two \nvariables in a pair of distributions, is a good proxy for the shrinkage factor.11 Positive correlations take a value \nof zero to 1.0.  \n \nSay you had a population of violinists, from beginners to concert-hall performers, and on a Monday rated the \nquality of their playing numerically from 1 (the worst) to 10 (the best). You then have them come back on \nTuesday and rate them again. The correlation coefficient would be very close to 1.0\u2014the best violinists would \nplay well both days, and the worst would be consistently bad. There is very little need to appeal to the outside \nview. The inside view correctly receives the preponderance of the weight in forecasting results.       \n \nUnlike the violinists, the correlation of excess returns of mutual funds is low.12 That means that in the short run, \nreturns that are well above or below average may not be a reliable indicator of skill. So it makes sense to use \na shrinkage factor that is much closer to zero than to 1.0. You accord the outside view most of the weight in \nyour forecast. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n9 \nTo summarize, here are the steps to integrate the outside view:13 \n \n Choose an appropriate reference class. The goal is to find a reference class that is large enough to \nbe statistically useful but sufficiently narrow to be applicable to the decision you face. In the world of \ninvesting and corporate performance, there is a rich amount of reference class data.  \n \n Assess the distribution of outcomes. These distributions are the heart of this book. Not all outcomes \nfollow a normal, bell-shaped distribution. For example, of the roughly 2,900 initial public offerings (IPOs) \nin technology since 1980, a small fraction of the companies have created the vast preponderance of the \nvalue. So while this is a relevant reference class, the outcomes are heavily skewed.  \n \n Make a prediction. With data from the reference class and knowledge of the distribution, make an \nestimate using the inside view. At this juncture you should be ready to consider a range of probabilities \nand outcomes.  \n \n Assess the reliability of your prediction and adjust as appropriate. This last step is a crucial one, \nas it takes into account how much you should regress your estimate toward the average. In cases where \ncorrelation is low, indicating low reliability, it is appropriate to regress your estimate substantially toward \nthe mean.  \n \nRegression toward the Mean \n \nRegression toward the mean is a tricky concept that most investors believe in but few fully understand.14 The \nconcept says that an outcome that is far from average will be followed by an outcome with an expected value \ncloser to the average. Here\u2019s an example to make the idea clearer. Say a teacher assigns her students 100 \npieces of information to study, and one particular student learns 80 of them. The teacher then creates a test \nby selecting 20 pieces of information at random. The student will score an 80 on average, but it is possible, \nalbeit extremely unlikely, that he will score 100 or 0.  \n \nAssume he scores 90. You could say that his skill contributed 80 and that good luck added 10. If the \nfollowing test has the same setup, what score would you expect? The answer, of course, is 80. You could \nassume that his skill of 80 would persist and that his luck, which is transitory, would be zero. Naturally, there\u2019s \nno way to know if luck will be zero. In fact, the student may get luckier on the second test. On average, \nhowever, the student\u2019s score will be closer to his skill. \n \nAny time the correlation coefficient between two measures of the same quantity over time is less than one, \nyou will see regression toward the mean. The additional insight is that the correlation coefficient indicates the \nrate of regression toward the mean. High correlations mean that you should expect modest regression while \nlow correlations suggest rapid regression. \n \nThe illusion of causality and the illusion of declining variance are two major errors in thinking commonly \nassociated with regression toward the mean. These illusions cause a lot of confusion for investors and even \ntrained economists. We will show how these apply to business in a moment, but we will start with a classic \nexample of human height. \n \nExhibit 3 shows the heights of more than 1,000 fathers and sons relative to the average of each population. \nThe left side of the exhibit shows regression toward the mean. Tall fathers have tall sons, but the tallest \nfathers are about eight inches taller than the average of all fathers while the tallest sons are only about four \ninches taller than the average of all sons.  \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n10 \nMore formally, the correlation coefficient is 0.50. Using the equation above, a son\u2019s height is expected to be \nhalfway between his father\u2019s height and the average. A son has an expected height of 73 inches if his father \nis 76 inches tall and the average for the male population is 70 inches (73 = 70 + 0.50(76-70)). \n \nExhibit 3: Heights of Fathers and Sons, and Sons and Fathers \n \nSource: Karl Pearson and Alice Lee, \u201cOn the Laws of Inheritance in Man: I. Inheritance of Physical Characteristics,\u201d Biometrika, Vol. 2, No. 4, \nNovember 1903, 357-462.  \n \nBut regression toward the mean implies something that doesn\u2019t make as much sense: because the \nphenomenon is the result of imperfect correlation, the arrow of time doesn\u2019t matter. So tall sons have tall \nfathers, but the sons have a greater difference between their heights and the average than their fathers do. \nThe same relationship is true for short sons and fathers. The right side of exhibit 3 shows this.  \n \nThat the arrow of time can point in either direction reveals the risk of falsely attributing causality. While it is \ntrue that tall fathers cause tall sons, it makes no sense to say that tall sons cause tall fathers. We find it \ndifficult to refrain from assigning causality, even though regression toward the mean doesn\u2019t require it. \n \nRegression toward the mean also seems to convey the sense that the difference between the extremes \nshrinks over time. But that sense is deceptive. The way to think about it is that the values that are far from \naverage basically have nowhere to go but toward the average, and the values that are close to average don\u2019t \nshow much change in the aggregate as large moves up and down cancel out one another.  \n \nAn examination of the dispersion of values is the best way to evaluate whether the distribution has changed. \nYou can do that by measuring the standard deviation of the distribution or, even better, the coefficient of \nvariation. A normalized measure of dispersion, the coefficient of variation equals the standard deviation divided \nby the mean. Exhibit 4 shows the distribution of the heights of fathers and sons. While the distributions are \ndifferent at the top, the tails are remarkably similar. The coefficient of variation is nearly identical. The heights \nof the sons are no more clustered toward the average than those of the fathers. \n \n \n \n \n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\nDifference in Height (inches)\nHeight (inches)\nAverage height\nFather\nFather\nSon\nSon\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\nDifference in Height (inches)\nHeight (inches)\nAverage height\nSon\nSon\nFather\nFather\n"

Inheritance of Physical Characteristics,\" Biometrika, Vol. 2, No. 4, \nNovember 1903, 357-462.  \n \nIf you ask a group of executives or investors to explain why companies with high CFROIs have lower CFROIs \nin the future, and companies with low CFROIs have higher prospective CFROIs, you will likely hear them chant \nthe word \u201ccompetition\u201d in unison. The thinking is straightforward. Companies with high CFROIs attract \ncompetition, driving down returns. Companies with low CFROIs disinvest and commonly consolidate, lifting \nreturns. This is basic microeconomics. \n \nThe left side of exhibit 5 shows this for roughly 6,600 global companies excluding the financial services and \nutilities sectors. We start by ranking companies by quintile based on CFROI less the median return for the \nuniverse. We then follow the companies over a decade. The cohort of companies with the highest returns \nrealizes an overall decline, while the cohort with the lowest returns sees its returns rise over the period. Just as \nwith the height data, this comes as no surprise. This is especially the case given the perceived role of \ncompetition. \n \nThe right side of exhibit 5 is less intuitive. It starts by ranking companies based on the CFROI for the most \nrecent year. It then tracks CFROI from 2015 to 2005, or back through time. We see the same pattern. While \nit makes sense to suggest that competition causes the regression in the left panel, it makes no sense to \nsuggest that competition works backward in time. This is true simply because the correlation is less than one \nbetween CFROIs from one period to the next. Regression toward the mean does not rely on the arrow of time. \nThis also demonstrates that competition is not the sole explanation for regression toward the mean.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n(10)-(8) (8)-(6) (6)-(4) (4)-(2)\n(2)-0\n0-2\n2-4\n4-6\n6-8\n8-10\nFrequency\nDifference from Average (inches)\nSon\nFather\n"

Microsoft\u2019s CFROI was 16.1 percent in the most recent fiscal year, the mean CFROI for the \ninformation technology sector was 9.0 percent from 1983-2015, and the four-year r for the sector is 0.50. \nBased on the formula, Microsoft\u2019s projected CFROI in four years is 12.6 percent, calculated as follows: \n \n12.6% = 9.0% + 0.50(16.1% \u2013 9.0%) \n \nAfter five years, we can assume that about one-half of Microsoft\u2019s excess CFROI will be gone, either as a \nresult of internal or external factors.  \n \nIt is important to underscore that this is not a specific prediction about Microsoft.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n16 \nEstimating the Mean to Which Results Regress  \n \nThe second issue we must address is the mean, or average, to which results regress. For some measures, \nsuch as sports statistics and the heights of parents and children, the means remain relatively stable over time. \nBut for other measures, including corporate performance, the mean can change from one period to the next. \n \nIn assessing the stability of the mean, you want to answer a couple of questions. The first is: How stable has \nthe mean been in the past? In cases where the average has been consistent over time and the environment \nisn\u2019t expected to change much, you can safely use past averages to anticipate future averages. \n \nThe blue lines in the middle of each chart of exhibit 11 are the mean (solid) and median (dashed) CFROI for \neach year for the consumer staples and energy sectors. The consumer staples sector had an average CFROI \nof 9.3 percent from 1983-2015, with a standard deviation of 0.6 percent. The energy sector had an average \nCFROI of 4.9 percent, with a standard deviation of 1.7 percent over the same period. So the CFROI in the \nenergy sector was lower than that for consumer staples and moved around a lot more.  \n \nIt comes as no surprise that the CFROI for energy is lower and more volatile than that for consumer staples. \nThis helps explain why regression toward the mean in energy is more rapid than that for consumer staples. \nYou can associate high volatility and low CFROIs with low valuation multiples, and low volatility and high \nCFROIs with high valuation multiples. This is what we see empirically for these sectors. \n \nAlso in exhibit 11 are gray dashed lines that capture the CFROI for the 75th and 25th percentile companies \nwithin the sector. If you ranked 100 companies in a sector from 100 (the highest) to 1 (the lowest) based on \nCFROI, the 75th percentile would be the CFROI of company number 75. So plotting the percentiles allows you \nto see the dispersion in CFROIs for the sector.  \n \nAnother way to show dispersion is with the coefficient of variation, which is the standard deviation of the \nCFROIs divided by the mean of the CFROIs. The coefficient of variation for 1983-2015 was 0.07 for \nconsumer staples and 0.34 for energy. For every 100 basis points of CFROI, there\u2019s much more variance in \nenergy than in consumer staples. \n \nExhibit 11: Mean and Median CFROI and 75th and 25th Percentiles \u2013 Consumer Staples and Energy  \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: Global companies, live and dead, with market capitalizations of $250 million-plus scaled, 1983-2015; Winsorized at 1st and 99th percentiles. \n \n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1983\n1991\n1999\n2007\n2015\nCFROI (Percent)\nConsumer Staples\n75th %\nMean\nMedian\n25th %\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1983\n1991\n1999\n2007\n2015\nCFROI (Percent)\nEnergy\n75th %\nMean\nMedian\n25th %\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n17 \nThe second question is: What are the factors that affect the mean CFROI? For example, the CFROI for the \nenergy sector might be correlated to swings in oil prices, or returns for the financial sector might be dictated \nby changes in regulations. Analysts must answer this question sector by sector. \n \nAs regression toward the mean is a concept that applies wherever correlations are less than perfect, thinking \nabout this second question can frame debates. Currently, for instance, there\u2019s a heated discussion about \nwhether operating profit margins in the U.S. are sustainable. The answer lies in what factors drive the level of \nprofit margins\u2014including labor costs and depreciation expense\u2014and what is happening to each factor. \n \nThere is regression toward the mean for the operating profit margins of companies within a sector or industry. \nThe question is whether average operating profit margins will rise, remain stable, or fall in coming years.  \n \nWe examine base rates for six categories of corporate performance and two categories of stock price \nmovement. For corporate performance, we consider: \n \n Sales growth. This is the most important driver of corporate value. Changes in sales, both in magnitude \nand composition, have a material influence on profitability and are generally larger than those for cost \nsavings or investment efficiencies. Changes in sales growth rates are particularly important for companies \nthat create shareholder value and have high expectations. \n \n Gross profitability. Gross profitability, defined as gross profit divided by assets, is a measure of a \ncompany\u2019s ability to make money. Academic research also shows that firms with high gross profitability \ndeliver better total shareholder returns than those with low profitability.  \n \n Operating leverage. Analysts are commonly too optimistic about earnings growth and often miss \nestimates by a wide margin. Operating leverage measures the change in operating profit as a function of \nthe change in sales. Operating leverage is high when a company realizes a relatively large change in \noperating profit for every dollar of change in sales. \n \n Operating profit margin. Operating profit margin, the ratio of operating income to sales, is one of the crucial \nindicators of profitability. Operating profit is the number from which you subtract cash taxes to calculate a \ncompany\u2019s net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). NOPAT is the number from which you subtract investments \nto calculate a company\u2019s free cash flow, and the numerator of a return on invested capital (ROIC) calculation.        \n \n Earnings growth. Executives and investors perceive that earnings are the best indicator of corporate \nresults. Nearly two-thirds of chief financial officers say that earnings are the most important measure that \nthey report to outsiders, giving it a vastly higher rating than other financial metrics such as revenue growth \nand cash flow from operations. Investors indicate that disclosure of quarterly earnings is the most \nsignificant of all releases. \n    \n CFROI. CFROI reflects a company\u2019s economic return on capital deployed by considering a company\u2019s \ninflation-adjusted cash flow and operating assets. CFROI removes the vagaries of accounting in order to \nprovide a metric that allows for comparison of corporate performance across a portfolio, a market, or a \nuniverse (cross sectional) as well as over time (longitudinal). CFROI shows which companies are creating \neconomic value and allows you to get a sense of market expectations. \n \n \n \n"

Revisions in sales \nforecasts are generally larger than those for cost savings or investment efficiencies. Changes in sales growth \nrates are particularly important for companies with high expectations that create shareholder value. Investors \nand executives are often too optimistic about growth rates companies will achieve.  \n \nResearchers who study forecasts of this nature find that two biases, optimism and overconfidence, are \ncommon. Optimism about personal predictions has value for encouraging perseverance in the face of \nchallenges but distorts assessments of likely outcomes.2 For example, notwithstanding that only about 50 \npercent of new businesses survive five or more years, a survey of thousands of entrepreneurs found that more \nthan 8 of 10 of them rated their odds of success at 70 percent or higher, and fully one-third did not allow for \nany probability of failure at all.3 The bottom line on optimism: \u201cPeople frequently believe that their preferred \noutcomes are more likely than is merited.\u201d4 \n \nOverconfidence bias also distorts the ability to make sound predictions. This bias reveals itself when an \nindividual\u2019s confidence in his or her subjective judgments is higher than the objective outcomes warrant. For \ninstance, nearly two thousand people answered 50 true-false questions and provided a confidence level for \neach. They were correct about 60 percent of the time but indicated confidence in their answers of 70 \npercent.5 Most people, including financial analysts, place too much weight on their own information.6  \n \nThe classic way that overconfidence shows up in forecasts is with ranges of outcomes that are too narrow. As \na case in point, researchers asked chief financial officers to predict the results for the stock market, including \nhigh and low growth rates within which the executives were 80 percent sure the results would land. They were \ncorrect only one-third of the time.7  \n \nExhibit 1 shows how this bias manifests in forecasts. Both are distributions of sales growth rates annualized \nover three years for roughly 1,000 of the largest companies by market capitalization in the world. The \ndistribution with the lower peak reflects the actual results since 1950, and the distribution with the higher peak \nis the set of growth rates that analysts are currently forecasting. We adjust both distributions to remove the \neffect of inflation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n23 \nWhile the data for the full sample are a start, you want to hone the reference class of base rates to make the \nresults more relevant and applicable. One approach is to break the universe into deciles based on a \ncompany\u2019s sales in the prior year. Within each size decile, we sort the observations of growth rates into bins in \nincrements of five percentage points (except for the tails).  \n \nThere is a modest survivorship bias because each sample includes only the firms that survived for that \nspecified period. For example, a company in our 10-year sample would have had to have survived for 10 years. \nAbout one-half of all public companies cease to exist within ten years of being listed.10 \n \nThe heart of this analysis is exhibit 4, which shows each decile, the total population, and an additional analysis \nof mega companies (those with sales in excess of $50 billion). Here\u2019s how you use the exhibit. Determine the \nbase sales level for the company that you want to model. Then go to the appropriate decile based on that size. \nYou now have the proper reference class and the distribution of growth rates over the various horizons.   \n \nLet\u2019s use Tesla as an example. In February 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer, said he hoped to \ngrow sales 50 percent per year for the next decade from an estimated sales base of $6 billion.11 How would \nyou assess the plausibility of that goal? Using the inside view, you would build a bottom-up model of the \nautomobile and battery businesses, considering the size of the markets, how they will likely grow, and what \nmarket shares Tesla might achieve.    \n \nThe outside view simply looks to see if growth at this rate is common in an appropriate reference class. Go to \nexhibit 4. You must first find the correct reference class, which is the decile that has a sales base of $4.5 - \n$7 billion. Next you examine the row of growth that is marked \u201c>45,\u201d representing sales growth of 45 percent \nor more. Going to the column \u201c10-Yr,\u201d you will see that no companies achieved this feat. Indeed, you have to \ngo down to 30-35 percent growth to see any companies, and even there it is only one-fifth of 1 percent of the \nsample. \n \n"

The appendix contains the sample sizes for \neach of the reference classes. Bear in mind that these data are adjusted for inflation and that most forecasts \nreflect inflation expectations. We will show how to incorporate these base rates into your forecasts for sales \ngrowth in a moment. For now, it\u2019s useful to acknowledge the utility of these data as an analytical guide and a \nvaluable reality check. \n \nGetting to the proper reference class is crucial, but there are some useful observations about the whole that \nare worth noting. To begin, as firm size increases the mean and median growth rates decline, as does the \nstandard deviation of the growth rates. This point has been well established empirically.12 Exhibit 5 shows this \npattern for annualized growth rates over three years. The lesson is to temper expectations about sales growth \nas companies get larger. \n \nExhibit 5: Growth Rates and Standard Deviations Decline with Size \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae. \nNote: Growth rates are annualized over three years. \n \nExhibit 6 shows that sales growth follows gross domestic product (GDP) reasonably closely. U.S. GDP growth \nand the median sales growth in the same year have a correlation coefficient of 0.66. (Positive correlations fall \nin the range of 0 to 1.0, where 0 is random and 1.0 is a perfect correlation.) From 1950-2015, U.S. GDP \ngrew at 3.2 percent per year, adjusted for inflation, with a standard deviation of 2.4 percent.  \n \nCorporate sales growth was higher than that of the broader economy for a few reasons. First, companies \ngrowing rapidly often need access to capital and hence choose to go public, likely creating a selection bias. \nSecond, some companies, including contract manufacturers, generate growth that is not captured in the GDP \nfigures. Finally, some companies grow outside the U.S., which shows up in sales growth but fails to be \nreflected in GDP.13 \n \n \n \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n>$50B\n>$100B\nFull\nUniverse\nSales 3-Year CAGR (Percent)\nDecile (Smallest to Largest by Sales)\nMean\nMedian\nStandard Deviation\nMega\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n28 \nUsing Base Rates to Model Sales Growth \n \nStudying base rates for sales growth is logical for two reasons. First, sales growth is the most important driver \nof value for most companies. Second, sales growth has a higher correlation from year to year than does \nearnings growth, which is the most commonly discussed item on the income statement.15 Sales growth is \nimportant and more predictable than profit growth.  \n \nAs we discussed in the introduction, we can examine the correlation coefficient (r) to gain insight into the rate \nof regression toward the mean. In this case, we consider the correlation in sales growth rates over two \ndifferent periods. Recall that a correlation near zero implies rapid regression toward the mean and a correlation \nnear one implies very modest regression.  \n \nExhibit 8 shows that the correlation coefficient is 0.30 for the year-to-year sales growth rate.16 This includes \nthe top 1,000 global companies by market capitalization from 1950 to 2015. Roughly 55,000 company years \nare in the data, and all of the figures are adjusted for inflation. \n \nExhibit 8: Correlation of One-Year Sales Growth Rates \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae and Credit Suisse. \nNote: Data winsorized at 2nd and 98th percentiles. \n \nNot surprisingly, the correlations are lower for longer time periods. Exhibit 9 shows the correlations for one-, \nthree-, and five-year horizons for the full population of companies. The base rate for the reference classes, \nthe median growth rate, should receive the majority of the weight for forecasts of three years or longer. In fact, \nyou might start with the base rate and seek reasons to move away from it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-30\n-15\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\n75\n-30\n-15\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\n75\n90\nSales Growth Next Year (Percent)\nSales Growth 1 Year (Percent)\nr = 0.30\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \n34 \nWhy Gross Profitability Is Important \n \nBenjamin Graham, the father of security analysis, spent some time with an aeronautical engineer named \nJames Rea in the 1970s. Together, they developed a screen to find attractive stocks that had ten criteria. \nBecause it was toward the end of Graham\u2019s life, some refer to the list as Graham\u2019s \u201clast will.\u201d1 About one-half \nof the measures were based on valuation, consistent with Graham\u2019s value orientation. But the other half \naddressed quality. So a company that passed the screen would be both statistically cheap and of high quality.  \n \nGross profitability is a measure of a company\u2019s ability to make money. Robert Novy-Marx, a professor of \nfinance at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester, defines gross profitability as revenues \nminus cost of goods sold, scaled by the book value of total assets. In other words, gross profitability is gross \nprofit divided by assets. Investors can use gross profitability as a proxy for quality and it is not positively \ncorrelated with classic measures of value.2 \n \nResearch shows that gross profitability is highly persistent in the short and long run. This means that you can \nmake a reasonable estimate of future profitability based on the past. Academic research also shows that firms \nwith high gross profitability deliver better total shareholder returns than those with low profitability. This is \ndespite the fact that they start with loftier price-to-book ratios.3 \n \nMany academics and practitioners now incorporate gross profitability into their asset pricing models. For \ninstance, Eugene Fama, a professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the Nobel Prize, and \nKenneth French, a professor of finance at the Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College, include \nprofitability as one of the factors that helps explain changes in asset prices. The others include beta (a \nmeasure of the sensitivity of an asset\u2019s returns to market returns), size, valuation, and investment.4 The \ndefinition of profitability that Fama and French use differs somewhat from that of Novy-Marx but captures the \nsame essence. \n \nThe power of profitability to explain total shareholder returns appears to be a global phenomenon.5 Using \nCompustat data (July 1963 to December 2010) and Compustat Global data (July 1990 to October 2009), \nNovy-Marx found that the stocks of more profitable firms outperformed the stocks of less profitable firms in \nthe United States as well as in developed markets outside the U.S. Both samples exclude stocks of \ncompanies in the financial services sector. These results are consistent with a study that examined the effect \nof gross profitability on total shareholder returns in 41 countries from 1980 to 2010.6  \n \nGross profitability may also be a useful factor to screen for in a search for attractive stocks. Profitability can \nprovide a very different signal than a price-earnings (P/E) multiple, which is the most common metric analysts \nuse to value stocks. A stock that appears unattractive using a P/E multiple may look attractive using gross \nprofitability, and a stock that appears unattractive using gross profitability may look attractive using a P/E \nmultiple. \n \nTake Amazon.com as a case. The stock had a trailing P/E multiple of roughly 540 at year-end 2015 based \non a price of $676 on December 31 and full-year reported earnings per share of $1.25. For context, the P/E \nmultiple was 20 for the S&P 500 at the same time. Based purely on its P/E multiple, the valuation of \nAmazon.com appeared high.  \n \nThe company\u2019s gross profitability told a different story. For 2015, Amazon.com\u2019s gross profitability was 0.54 \n(gross profit of $35 billion and total assets of $65 billion). According to Novy-Marx, gross profitability of 0.33 \nor higher is generally attractive.7 Not only did Amazon.com\u2019s recent gross profitability surpass that level easily, \nit has been well above that threshold for most of the company\u2019s history (see Exhibit 1). \n"

For example, the correlation between profitability in the current year and three years in the \nfuture has a coefficient, r, of 0.89 (middle panel of Exhibit 2). But even the five-year correlation is high at \n0.82 (right panel).  \n \nThis universe includes the top 1,000 firms in the world from 1950 to 2015 as measured by market \ncapitalization.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n41 \nWhy Operating Leverage Is Important \n \nSources of revisions in expectations include fundamental outcomes (typically earnings revisions) and an \nassessment of how the market will value those fundamentals (multiple expansion or contraction).1 Investors \nwho are able to forecast earnings in a year\u2019s time that are substantially different than today\u2019s expectations can \nearn meaningful excess returns.2  \n \nAnalysts are commonly too optimistic about earnings growth and often miss estimates by a wide margin.3 This \nis especially pronounced for companies that have high operating leverage and surprise the market with weak \nsales.4 Buy-side analysts are generally more optimistic and less accurate than sell-side analysts.5   \n \nOperating leverage measures the change in operating profit as a function of the change in sales. Operating \nleverage is high when a company realizes a relatively large change in operating profit for every dollar of change \nin sales. Operating leverage is low when operating profit is mostly unchanged for every dollar of change in \nsales. Operating profit is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and is the same as operating income.  \n \nWe outline a systematic way to assess earnings revisions with a specific emphasis on operating leverage. The \ngoal is to be able to better anticipate revisions in expectations. The issue of operating leverage does not \nreceive enough attention, in our view, and it can provide insight into excess returns. For instance, there is \nempirical evidence that operating leverage can help explain the value premium.6 \n \nExhibit 1 is the roadmap for this analysis. The process starts on the left side with an analysis of the change in \nsales. Sales changes, in turn, can be refined using \u201cvalue factors\u201d to determine the impact on operating profit. \nThe value factors are based on established microeconomic principles. Consideration of sales changes and the \nrole of the value factors allows you to calculate operating leverage, or \u201coperating margin beta (\u03b2).\u201d You can \nthen incorporate the degree of financial leverage to determine the variability of earnings.  \n \nThe main utility of exhibit 1 is to allow you to understand the cause and effect of changes in earnings. The \ninteraction between sales and operating profit is crucial. Not all sales growth has the same effect on \nprofitability. Note that you can use the roadmap to analyze the past as well as to anticipate the future.     \n \nExhibit 1: Framework for Assessing Operating Leverage \n \nSource: Alfred Rappaport and Michael J.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n42 \nThe easiest way to think about operating leverage is as the ratio of fixed to variable costs. Fixed costs are \ncosts that a company must bear irrespective of its sales level. If sales shrink, fixed costs don\u2019t budge and \nprofits fall sharply. Conversely, profits rise substantially if sales grow. Theme parks are an example of a \nbusiness with high operating leverage. Roughly three-quarters of the costs for that business are fixed, with \nlabor as the largest component.7  \n \nVariable costs are linked to output. These costs rise and fall in tandem with sales. The commissions a \ncompany pays to its sales force are an example of a variable cost. Commissions move together with sales, \nlimiting the degree of operating leverage.    \n \nExhibit 2 illustrates the impact that sales changes have on operating profit margins for businesses with high \n(75 percent) or low (25 percent) fixed costs. The operating profit margin is 20 percent for both businesses \nwhen sales are $10 million. At $25 million of sales, the high-fixed-cost business sees its operating profit \nmargin soar to nearly 60 percent, while the low-fixed-cost business has an operating profit margin of only \nslightly above 30 percent. At $5 million of sales, however, the business with high fixed costs loses money and \nrecords a margin of -40 percent, while the business with low variable costs breaks even.    \n \nExhibit 2: Cost Structure Composition and Operating Profit Scalability \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.  \nNote: Cost structure based on $10 million in sales. \n \nExhibit 3 shows the ratio of fixed assets to total assets by sector.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n46 \nIndustry growth is the primary factor that analysts consider when they make sales forecasts.11 There are a \nnumber of issues to consider when assessing industry growth.12 The first is where the industry is in its life \ncycle.13 Industry growth tends to follow an S-curve, where there is rapid sales growth for a time followed by \nflattened sales growth. Industries have different rates of growth as well as variations in growth rates.14 \n \nOne common analytical mistake is to extrapolate high growth in the middle of an S-curve. One famous \nexample is the production of color television sets, which were launched in the late 1950s and reached a sales \npeak in 1968. The industry grew rapidly in the 1960s, which encouraged manufacturers to add capacity. But \nthey extrapolated the sharp growth and failed to recognize the top of the S-curve. The result was \nmanufacturing capacity in the later 1960s of 14 million units and peak unit sales of 6 million units. A sensible \njudgment of the number of potential customers multiplied by the revenue per customer informs the \nassessment of industry size.  \n    \nMergers and acquisitions (M&A) are also important in determining sales growth. One study of the sales growth \nof large companies found that M&A accounted for about one-third of total top-line gain.15 Large M&A deals \nmerit careful analysis because they can change the nature of a company\u2019s operating leverage. However, the \nevidence shows it is challenging to create substantial value through M&A.16   \n \nChanges in a company\u2019s market share within an industry also influence sales growth rates. Market shares \ntend to be volatile in emerging industries, as technological change is rapid and entry and exit is rampant.17 But \nmarket shares tend to settle down as an industry matures. There is a positive correlation between market \nshare and profitability. But there is also evidence that corporate objectives focused on competitors, including \nmarket share targets, are mostly harmful to a firm\u2019s profitability.18   \n \nSales growth is the most important value driver for most companies because it is the largest source of cash \nand affects four of the value factors. But it is important to emphasize that sales growth, profit growth, and \nvalue creation are distinct. Sales growth only creates value when a company earns a rate of return on \ninvestment that is above the cost of capital. As a result, companies can grow profits without creating value. \nIndeed, sales growth destroys value for a company earning a return below the cost of capital. \n \nThe threshold margin is the level of operating profit margin at which a company earns its cost of capital.22 To \nbreak even in terms of economic value, a company with higher capital intensity requires a higher operating \nprofit margin than a company with lower capital intensity. So threshold margin is an analytically sound way to \nmake the connection between sales growth, profits, and value creation. Appendix A defines threshold margin \nand incremental threshold margin. Appendix B shows that the overall rise in operating profit margin has been \ndriven by companies in the highest margin quintile and documents the history of operating profit margin by \nsector. \n \nThe Factors That Determine Operating Leverage \n \nSales changes can have varying effects on operating profit margins. Careful consideration of the value factors, \nincluding volume, price and mix, operating leverage, and economies of scale, will allow you to sort out cause \nand effect. Here\u2019s a quick description of the value factors:19 \n \n Volume. Volume captures the potential revision in expectations for the number of units a company sells. \nVolume changes lead to sales changes and can influence operating profit margins through operating \nleverage and economies of scale.  \n \n"

If a \ncompany can raise its price in an amount greater than its incremental cost, margins will rise. Warren \nBuffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the most successful \ninvestors in the past half century, argued that \u201cthe single most important decision in evaluating a business \nis pricing power.\u201d This is not just relevant for established businesses. Marc Andreessen, co-founder and \ngeneral partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, recently said \u201cprobably the single \nnumber one thing we try to get our companies to do is raise prices.\u201d20  \n \nPrice elasticity, a measure of the change in the demand for the quantity of a good or service relative to a \nchange in price, is one way to assess pricing power. Goods or services that are inelastic (e.g., cigarettes \nand gasoline) have small changes in demand for a given price change, whereas price changes create \nlarge changes in demand for elastic goods (e.g., leisure airline travel and high-end spirits). One study of \nprice elasticity for a sample of roughly 370 goods found that a 1 percent change in price would lead to \nan average of a 1.76 percent change in demand.21      \n \nPrice mix captures the change in sales of high- and low-margin products. Goodyear Tire & Rubber is an \nexample of a company that has had a positive sales mix in recent years. Goodyear\u2019s sales in 2015 were \n28 percent lower than those in 2011 and its total unit volume was 8 percent less. Both sales and volume \ndeclined in each year since 2011 with the exception of 2015 for volume. Yet the company\u2019s operating \nincome rose nearly 50 percent over that period, while its operating profit margin expanded 6 percentage \npoints. A shift in mix from low-margin commodity tires to high-margin premium tires allowed the company \nto increase operating margins.22 Exhibit 7 summarizes these figures. \n \nExhibit 7: Goodyear Tire & Rubber Change in Sales Mix (2011-2015) \n \nSource: Company reports. \n \n Operating Leverage. Businesses almost always invest money before they can generate sales and \nprofits. These outlays are called \u201cpreproduction costs.\u201d For some companies, including those in the \nchemical, steel, and utility businesses, the costs relate to physical facilities. These investments are \ncapitalized on the balance sheet and the accountants depreciate their value on the income statement \nover time. Other companies, such as those in the biotechnology or software industries, make huge \ninvestments in research and development or in writing code but expense most of those investments.  \n \nPreproduction costs lower operating profit margins in the short run. But as subsequent sales of the good \nor service occur, margins rise.

A company enjoys economies of scale when it can perform key activities at a \nlower cost per unit as its volume increases. These tasks include purchasing, production, marketing, sales, \nand distribution. Economies of scale lead to greater efficiency as volume increases. This is distinct from \noperating leverage, where margin improvement is the result of spreading preproduction costs over larger \nvolumes. Mistaking operating leverage for economies of scale may lead to the incorrect conclusion that \nunit costs will decline even as the company expands to meet new demand. \n \nThe financial results of Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer in the United States, are an \nexample of economies of scale. Home Depot\u2019s gross margins expanded from 27.7 percent in fiscal \n1996 to 29.9 percent in fiscal 2001 as it added incremental sales in excess of $30 billion. The company \nattributed the improvement in its profitability to the ability to use its size to get better prices from suppliers. \n \n Cost Efficiencies. Cost efficiencies can also affect operating profit margin but are unrelated to sales \nchanges and hence not relevant to a discussion of operating leverage. Still, you must account for \noperating margin changes as the result of cost efficiencies. These efficiencies come about in two ways. \nA company can either reduce costs within an activity or it can reconfigure its activities.23  \n \nThe discussion of sales changes and the value factors provides you with a framework to consider operating \nleverage, or how operating profit rises or falls as a function of a change in sales. We now turn to an empirical \nexamination of operating leverage by sector to understand the past and to get a sense of where operating \nleverage is most pronounced. \n \nEmpirical Results for Operating Leverage \n \nWe measure operating leverage by examining the relationship between the change in sales and the change in \noperating profit in a particular period. Exhibit 10 shows this calculation for the top 1,000 global companies by \nmarket capitalization, excluding companies in the financial services and utilities industries, over 1- and 3-year \nperiods from 1950 through 2015. We call the slope of the least-squares regression line the \u201coperating margin \nbeta (\u03b2),\u201d and it is a good proxy for the degree of operating leverage. The operating margin \u03b2 for both periods \nis about 0.11, and is slightly higher for the one-year change. The way to interpret the \u03b2 is that for every $1.00 \nchange in sales, operating profit changes by approximately $0.11.  \n \nExhibit 10: Operating Leverage for the Top 1,000 Global Companies, 1950-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae. \nNote: All amounts in 2015 U.S. dollars; winsorized at 2nd and 98th percentiles. \ny = 0.104x - 0.010\n-2,000\n-1,000\n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n-10,000\n0\n10,000\n20,000\n30,000\n3-Year Change in Operating Income\n3-Year Change in Sales\ny = 0.115x + 1.833\n-1,500\n-1,000\n-500\n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n-5,000\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n1-Year Change in Operating Income\n1-Year Change in Sales\n"

The process involves \nconsideration of macroeconomic outcomes and microeconomic factors, informed by empirical results. This \nanalysis is the basis for \u201casset beta,\u201d the risk of a company based on the volatility of operating income and \nwithout regard for financial policy. We now introduce the role of financial leverage as a final step to understand \nvolatility in earnings.       \n \nThe Role of Financial Leverage in Earnings Volatility \n \nEarnings volatility for a company is determined by the combination of volatility in operating profit and financial \nleverage. Financial leverage captures the amount of debt a company assumes, net of the cash that it holds. \nLots of debt increases the volatility of earnings because a company has to pay interest expense, which you \ncan think of as another fixed cost. As a result, financial leverage amplifies changes in operating income. In \nexhibit 1, we refer to this as \u201cfinancial leverage beta (\u03b2).\u201d  \n \nTo illustrate the impact of financial leverage \u03b2, consider two companies, A and B, which have the same \nscenarios for operating profit next year: \n \n \n \nSince A is free of debt, the variability of pretax profit mirrors that of operating profit. In this case, the highest \nprofit scenario ($120) is 50 percent greater than the lowest ($80). \n \n \n \nB has debt and hence interest expense. The variability of pretax profit for B is much higher than that for A. \nThe highest profit ($90) is 80 percent greater than the lowest profit ($50). The addition of debt creates more \nvolatility in earnings and may suggest different values for the businesses.   \n \nExhibit 13 shows the debt-to-total capital ratios by sector. This ratio uses the book value of debt and the \nmarket value of equity and reflects an adjustment for leases. Higher ratios of debt to total capital are \nconsistent with higher financial leverage. However, the substantial increase in cash holdings distorts this \nrelationship. For example, Apple\u2019s debt-to-total-capital ratio was approximately 14 percent on June 30, 2016 \n(debt of $85 billion and market value of equity of $515 billion). But the company had a cash balance in excess \nof $200 billion. This means that the company\u2019s net cash position was in excess of $100 billion even after \nconsidering the taxes the company would pay if it repatriated the money. \n \n \nCompany A\nOperating profit\nInterest expense\nPretax profit\nBullish scenario\n$120\n$0\n$120\nBase case scenario\n100\n0\n100\nBearish scenario\n80\n0\n80\nCompany B\nOperating profit\nInterest expense\nPretax profit\nBullish scenario\n$120\n$30\n$90\nBase case scenario\n100\n30\n70\nBearish scenario\n80\n30\n50\n"

One way to do this is to calculate the threshold margin, or the level of operating profit margin at \nwhich a company earns its cost of capital. To break even in terms of economic value, a company with higher \ncapital intensity requires a higher margin than a company with lower capital intensity.29 \n \nLet\u2019s examine a simple example. Assume a company has the following financial characteristics:  \n \nBase sales \n$100  \nSales growth \n8.0% \nOperating profit margin (base) \n8.4% \nOperating profit margin (incremental) \n8.4% \nIncremental fixed capital rate \n35% \nIncremental working capital rate \n25% \nTax rate \n35% \nCost of capital \n10% \n \nThe definitions for sales growth, operating profit margin, tax rate, and the cost of capital are straightforward. \nThe incremental fixed capital rate captures how much a company will spend on incremental investments in \nfixed capital (more formally, capital expenditures minus depreciation) and is measured as a percentage change \nin sales.  \n \nFor example, if sales grow by $10 and the incremental fixed capital rate is 35 percent, the company\u2019s capital \nexpenditure, net of depreciation, is $3.5. The same idea applies to working capital. For every incremental \ndollar in sales, the incremental working capital rate measures the percent a company needs to reinvest in \nworking capital.  \n \nWe get these figures if we apply the numbers to five years of free cash flow: \n \nYear 0 \nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nYear 3 \nYear 4 \nYear 5 \nSales \n$100.0 \n108.0 \n116.6 \n126.0 \n136.0 \n146.9 \nOperating income \n8.4 \n9.1 \n9.8 \n10.6 \n11.4 \n12.3 \nTaxes \n3.2 \n3.4 \n3.7 \n4.0 \n4.3 \nIncremental fixed capital  \n2.8 \n3.0 \n3.3 \n3.5 \n3.8 \nIncremental fixed capital  \n2.0 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n2.7 \nFree cash flow \n1.1 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.5 \n \nWe can see that the company is growing modestly. But the question is whether it is creating shareholder value. \nWe can only assess that by determining whether the company earns a return on its incremental investments \nthat exceeds the cost of capital.  \n \nThe answer is that this company is value neutral (see the column \u201cshareholder value added\u201d at the far right \nbelow). It earns its cost of capital on its investments. This demonstrates that growth does not equal value \ncreation.  \n \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n59 \nWhy Operating Profit Margin Is Important \n \nA company creates value when it generates earnings in excess of the opportunity cost of the capital it deploys. \nOperating profit margin, which is the ratio of operating income to sales, is one of the crucial indicators of \nprofitability. Since our figures capture reported results, the data reflect stock-based compensation only when \nthe accounting rules have required companies to record it as an expense. This occurred around 2005 for most \nlarge companies.  \n \nOperating profit is the number from which you subtract cash taxes in order to calculate a company\u2019s net \noperating profit after tax (NOPAT). NOPAT is a central figure in valuation. NOPAT is the number from which \nyou subtract investments to calculate a company\u2019s free cash flow (FCF). FCF is the cash that is distributable \nto a company\u2019s debtors and equity holders, and hence is the lifeblood of corporate value. NOPAT is also the \nnumerator of a return on invested capital (ROIC) calculation.        \n \nYou can decompose ROIC, or a variant such as CFROI, into two parts: profitability (NOPAT/sales) and capital \nvelocity (sales/invested capital). Generally speaking, companies pursuing a cost leadership strategy have low \nmargins and high capital velocity. Think of Wal-Mart Stores as an example. The company does not make \nmuch money on each item it sells, but it sells a lot of items. Companies that pursue a differentiation strategy \nhave high margins and low capital velocity. Consider Tiffany & Company, the luxury jewelry retailer, which \nmakes a lot on the items it sells, but does not sell that many items. Operating profit margin is important \nbecause it not only measures profitability but it also gives you a sense of a company\u2019s competitive positioning.  \n \nPersistence of Operating Profit Margin \n \nExhibit 1 shows that the operating profit margin is very persistent over one-, three-, and five-year periods. For \nexample, the correlation between operating margin in the current year and three years in the future has a \ncoefficient, r, of 0.79 (middle panel). But even the five-year correlation is relatively high at 0.72 (right panel).  \n \nThis universe includes the top 1,000 firms in the world from 1950 to 2015, measured by market capitalization. \nThe sample includes dead companies but excludes firms in the financial and utilities sectors. The data include \nmore than 40,000 company years and there is no need to take into account inflation because operating \nmargin is expressed as a ratio. \n \nExhibit 1: Persistence of Operating Profit Margin \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nData winsorized at 2n and 98th percentile. \n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nOperating Margin in 5 Years (Percent)\nOperating Margin (Percent)\nr = 0.72\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nOperating Margin in 3 Years (Percent)\nOperating Margin (Percent)\nr = 0.79\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nOperating Margin Next Year (Percent)\nOperating Margin (Percent)\nr = 0.91\n"

We start by sorting companies into quintiles based on \noperating profit margin at the beginning of a year. For each of the 5 cohorts, we follow the operating profit \nmargin less the median for the full population over 10 years. There is only slight regression toward the mean. \nThe spread from the highest to the lowest quintile only shrinks from 0.21 to 0.15.

This reduces the size of \nthe sample but increases its relevance. We present a guide for calculating the rate of regression toward the \nmean, as well as the proper mean to use, for eight sectors. We exclude the financial and utilities sectors.  \n \nExhibit 3 examines operating margin in the consumer staples and energy sectors.

The sample excludes companies in the financial services and utility industries. The \naggregate margin is total operating profit divided by total sales for the companies in the sample. The decline in \noperating profit margin from 1950 through the early 1980s is the result of increased global competition in an \neconomy dominated by manufacturing.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n68 \nWhy Earnings Growth Is Important \n \nExecutives and investors perceive that earnings are the best indicator of corporate results. In a survey of \nfinancial executives, nearly two-thirds said that earnings are the most important measure that they report to \noutsiders and gave it a vastly higher rating than other financial metrics such as revenue growth and cash flow \nfrom operations.1 In a separate survey, a majority of investors indicated that quarterly earnings is the disclosure \nthat is most significant.2 Consistent with these views, many companies provide some form of earnings \nguidance, and the price-earnings multiple is the most popular way to assign a value to a company\u2019s stock.3   \n \nYet earnings have severe limitations as a measure of shareholder value. The main reasons include the fact \nthat management can use alternative accounting methods to calculate earnings, that earnings fail to capture \nthe capital needs of the business, and that earnings don\u2019t reflect the cost of capital. As a result, it is possible \nto increase earnings without creating value.4   \n \nThe popularity of earnings has spawned extensive research on the link between earnings per share (EPS) and \nstock prices.5 Studies from the late 1960s show that annual earnings announcements convey information to \nthe market, as measured by a rise in trading volume and stock price volatility.6 Public companies in the United \nStates were not required to file quarterly income statements, through Form 10-Q, until 1970. Further, \ncompanies outside the U.S. realized an increase in the information content of their earnings announcements \nfollowing the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.7  \n \nRecent work on the impact of earnings not only confirms the original finding, but also shows that the \ninformation content of earnings has risen since 2001.8 One plausible explanation is that since the adoption of \nRegulation Fair Disclosure in 2000, which ensures that all investors receive financial information at the same \ntime, companies convey less information between earnings reports. Other researchers find that earnings are \nless relevant today as a result of a broad shift from tangible to intangible investment.9 To add context to this \ndiscussion, researchers estimate that each quarterly earnings announcement reflects one to two percent of \nthe total new information available in each year.10     \n \nCompanies can increase the information content of their earnings disclosure and guidance by providing more \ndetail about the components of earnings. That detail leads to more timely revisions by analysts, more frequent \nrevisions, and a lower dispersion of forecasts among the analysts. Academics have found that about 40 \npercent of large companies in the U.S. provide no earnings guidance and less than a quarter provide revenue, \nexpense, and earnings forecasts.11  \n \nFurther, studies show that there has been a growing rift between \u201cStreet\u201d earnings and earnings based on \ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In recent decades, companies have been more liberal in \nexcluding \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cnon-cash items\u201d from GAAP earnings to come up with Street earnings. Potential \nmotivations for emphasizing Street earnings include an effort by managers and investors to boost corporate \nvalue and an attempt to remove transitory elements from earnings so as to improve the ability to estimate \nfuture cash flows. While it is unclear which motivation is dominant, the research does demonstrate that Street \nEPS have a higher correlation with stock price movement than GAAP EPS do.12   \n \nEPS are ubiquitous and provide some information that affect stock prices. Growth in EPS creates shareholder \nvalue when a company makes investments that earn a return in excess of the cost of capital. In general, there \nis a positive correlation between EPS growth and total shareholder return. Indeed, investors who can anticipate \nearnings in 12 months that are substantially different than today\u2019s forecast stand to earn substantial excess \nreturns.13   \n \n"

You can improve your earnings forecasts by carefully considering accruals. Accruals \nthat are less reliable, such as an estimate for the collection of accounts receivable, are associated with lower \nearnings persistence than accruals with more persistence such as accounts payable.15 \n \nThe goal of this report is to help guide thinking with regard to earnings growth.16 This is especially true for \ngrowth companies, where analysts tend to be optimistic about the future. Indeed, when sentiment is bullish, \nearnings forecasts by analysts tend to be optimistic, especially for firms that are difficult to value using \nconventional measures.17 \n \nAnalysts tend to be too sanguine when they forecast net income growth.18 Consistent with the overconfidence \nbias, exhibit 1 shows that the range of expected outcomes is narrower than what the results of the past \nsuggest is reasonable. Both are distributions of net income growth rates annualized over three years for \nroughly 1,000 of the largest companies by market capitalization in the world. The distribution with the lower \npeak reflects the actual results since 1950, and the distribution with the higher peak is the set of growth rates \nthat analysts are currently forecasting. We adjust both distributions to remove the effect of inflation.  \n \nSpecifically, the standard deviation of estimates is 19.2 percent versus a standard deviation of 34.6 percent \nfor the past growth rates. Forecasts are commonly too optimistic and too narrow. The best explanations for \nthe pattern of faulty forecasts include behavioral biases and distortions encouraged by incentives. \n \nExhibit 1: Overconfidence\u2014Range of Net Income Growth Rates Too Narrow \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae and FactSet. \nNote: I/B/E/S consensus estimates as of September 19, 2016; Sample excludes companies with negative beginning or ending net income. \n \nBase Rates of Earnings Growth \n \nAn investor\u2019s primary task is to determine whether the expectations for future financial performance, as \nimplied by the stock price, are too optimistic or pessimistic relative to how the company is likely to perform.

Sales growth is more persistent than earnings growth, but less \npredictive of total shareholder return.20 The sample throughout this report includes the net income growth of \nthe top 1,000 global companies by market capitalization since 1950. These companies currently represent \nabout 60 percent of the global market capitalization. The data include all sectors. The sample size is \nsomewhat smaller than 1,000 in the early years but reaches 1,000 by the late 1960s. The population includes \ncompanies that are now dead. \n \nWe use a definition of net income that is before extraordinary items. We calculate the compound annual \ngrowth rates (CAGR) of net income for 1, 3, 5, and 10 years for each firm. We adjust all of the figures to \nremove the effects of inflation, which translates all of the numbers to 2015 dollars.  \n \nExhibit 2 shows the results for the full sample. In the panel on the left, the rows show net income growth rates \nand the columns reflect time periods. Say you want to know what percent of the universe grew net income at \na CAGR of 10-20 percent for five years. You start with the row marked \u201c10-20\u201d and slide to the right to find \nthe column \u201c5-Yr.\u201d There, you\u2019ll see that 20.3 percent of the companies achieved that rate of growth.

One way to do that is to break the universe into deciles based on a \ncompany\u2019s starting annual sales. Within each size decile, we sort the observations of growth rates into bins in \nincrements of 10 percentage points (except for the tails). \n \nThe heart of this analysis is exhibit 4, which shows each decile, the total population, and an additional analysis \nof mega companies (those with sales in excess of $50 billion). Here\u2019s how you use the exhibit. Determine the \nbase sales level for the company that you want to model. Then go to the appropriate decile based on that size. \nYou now have the proper reference class and the distribution of growth rates for the various time horizons.   \n \nLet\u2019s use Alphabet Inc. as an example. As of early September 2016, the consensus for net income growth \nover the next three years, according to the I/B/E/S consolidated estimate of analysts, is about 15 percent per \nyear after accounting for inflation. We first find the correct reference class. In this case, it\u2019s the bin that has a \nsales base in excess of $50 billion. Next we examine the row of growth that is marked \u201c10-20,\u201d representing \na net income growth rate of between 10 and 20 percent. Going out to the column under \u201c3-Yr,\u201d we see that \n15.4 percent of companies achieved this feat.  \n \nIn total, exhibit 4 shows results for 44 reference classes (11 size ranges times 4 time horizons) that should \ncover the vast majority of possible outcomes for net income growth. The appendix contains the sample sizes \nfor each of the reference classes.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n75 \nNext, net income growth follows gross domestic product (GDP) growth reasonably closely in the U.S. (see \nExhibit 7). The correlation coefficient is 0.48 between annual GDP growth and after-tax corporate profit from \nthe national income and product accounts (NIPA). Over the 69-year period from 1947 to 2015, U.S. GDP \ngrew 3.2 percent per year, adjusted for inflation, with a standard deviation of 2.6 percent. Net income, also \nadjusted for inflation, grew at 3.2 percent with a standard deviation of 13.1 percent.  \n \nExhibit 7: Net Income Growth Rate Is Correlated with GDP Growth (1947-2015) \n \nSource: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, September 8, 2016: Real Gross Domestic \nProduct, Corporate Profits After Tax (without IVA and CCAdj), and Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator. \n \nWarren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, admonishes companies to avoid predicting \nrapid growth. Here\u2019s what he wrote in his letter to shareholders in 2000:22 \n \nCharlie [Munger] and I think it is both deceptive and dangerous for CEOs to predict growth rates for \ntheir companies. They are, of course, frequently egged on to do so by both analysts and their own \ninvestor relations departments. They should resist, however, because too often these predictions lead \nto trouble. \n \nIt\u2019s fine for a CEO to have his own internal goals and, in our view, it\u2019s even appropriate for the CEO to \npublicly express some hopes about the future, if these expectations are accompanied by sensible \ncaveats. But for a major corporation to predict that its per-share earnings will grow over the long term \nat, say, 15% annually is to court trouble. \n \nThat\u2019s true because a growth rate of that magnitude can only be maintained by a very small \npercentage of large businesses. Here\u2019s a test: Examine the record of, say, the 200 highest earning \ncompanies from 1970 or 1980 and tabulate how many have increased per-share earnings by 15% \nannually since those dates. You will find that only a handful have. I would wager you a very significant \nsum that fewer than 10 of the 200 most profitable companies in 2000 will attain 15% annual growth \nin earnings-per-share over the next 20 years. \n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\nAnnual Real Corporate Profit Growth (Percent)\nAnnual Real GDP Growth (Percent)\nr = 0.48\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n76 \nWe ran a version of Buffett\u2019s test. We started by identifying the 200 companies with the highest net income in \n1990. By 2000, only 162 of those companies were still around (mergers and acquisitions claimed most of the \nothers). Of those, less than 9 percent (14 of 162) grew net income at a rate of 15 percent or more from \n1990-1999. None of those 14 companies grew at higher than a 15 percent rate for the decade ended in \n2009. Buffett\u2019s sense of the base rate is accurate. \n \nThe reason that unrealistic expectations are worrisome is that executives may start to change their behavior \nfor the worse. His letter continues: \n \nThe problem arising from lofty predictions is not just that they spread unwarranted optimism. Even \nmore troublesome is the fact that they corrode CEO behavior. Over the years, Charlie and I have \nobserved many instances in which CEOs engaged in uneconomic operating maneuvers so that they \ncould meet earnings targets they had announced. Worse still, after exhausting all that operating \nacrobatics would do, they sometimes played a wide variety of accounting games to \u201cmake the \nnumbers.\u201d These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing: Once a company moves \nearnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to engage in \nfurther accounting maneuvers that must be even more \u201cheroic.\u201d These can turn fudging into fraud. \n(More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.) \n \nCharlie and I tend to be leery of companies run by CEOs who woo investors with fancy predictions. A \nfew of these managers will prove prophetic \u2014 but others will turn out to be congenital optimists, or \neven charlatans. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not easy for investors to know in advance which species they are \ndealing with. \n \nFinally, notwithstanding our natural tendency to anticipate growth, 33 percent of the companies in the sample \nhad a negative growth rate in net income year over year, after an adjustment for inflation. Further, 31 percent \nof the firms realized lower net income for 3 years, 29 percent for 5 years, and 24 percent for 10 years.   \n \nEarnings and Total Shareholder Returns \n \nNet income is hard to forecast but there is a solid positive correlation between net income growth and total \nshareholder return. Exhibit 8 shows that the correlation coefficient is 0.20 for 1 year, 0.39 for 3 years, and \n0.40 for 5 years. So there is a potential payoff from successfully predicting net income growth, but the ability \nto do so is challenging.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

First, net income growth, despite its \nflaws, is the most popular measure of corporate results. Second, net income growth does have a decent \ncorrelation with total shareholder return. Net income growth is not persistent, but it is predictive of changes in \nstock price. Finally, earnings are a significant component of many incentive compensation programs.  \n \nExhibit 9 shows that the correlation coefficient is -0.05 for the year-to-year net income growth rate. This \nincludes the top 1,000 global companies by market capitalization from 1950 to 2015. Nearly 50,000 \ncompany years are in the data, and all of the figures are adjusted for inflation.  \n \nYou can interpret this result as follows: for a population of companies with net income growth that is far from \naverage in a particular year, the expected value of the next year\u2019s net income growth is close to the average. \nFor companies with high growth, the expected value is actually slightly below the average growth rate, and for \ncompanies with low growth the expected value is slightly above the average growth rate.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n83 \nWhy CFROI Is Important \n  \nCash Flow Return on Investment (CFROI) reflects a company\u2019s economic return on capital deployed by \nconsidering a company\u2019s inflation-adjusted cash flow and operating assets. CFROI aims to remove the \nvagaries of accounting figures in order to provide a metric that allows for comparison of corporate \nperformance across a portfolio, a market, or a universe (cross sectional) as well as over time (longitudinal).1  \n \nCFROI is important for a few reasons. First, it shows which companies are creating value using a sound \neconomic framework. The model also allows you to get a sense of market expectations, or what is priced into \nthe shares. Finally, CFROI provides for direct comparability across time, industries, and geographies. \n \nThe calculation of CFROI starts with a measure of inflation-adjusted gross cash flows available to all capital \nowners and compares that to the inflation-adjusted gross investment made by the capital owners. It then \ntranslates this ratio into an internal rate of return by recognizing the finite economic life of depreciating assets \nand the residual value of non-depreciating assets.  \n \nCFROI is appropriate for industrial and service firms. However, Cash Flow Return on Equity (CFROE\u00ae) is a \nbetter measure for financial companies. Similar to CFROI, CFROE reflects economic adjustments but also \nreflects that lenders utilize the liability side of the balance sheet to generate value.  \n \nPersistence of CFROI \n \nExhibit 1 shows that CFROI is reasonably persistent over one- and four-year periods. The correlation between \nCFROI in the current year and four years in the future has a coefficient, r, of 0.56 (right panel of Exhibit 1). The \none-year correlation is even higher, at 0.78 (left panel).  \n \nThis universe includes global companies with a market cap of $250 million scaled over time and covers the years \n1983-2015. The sample includes dead companies. \n \nExhibit 1: Persistence of CFROI, 1983-2015 \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: Global companies, live and dead, with market capitalizations of $250 million-plus scaled; Winsorized at 1st and 99th percentiles. \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n84 \nExhibit 2 shows the stability of CFROI.2 We start by sorting companies into quintiles based on CFROI minus the \nmedian of the universe at the beginning of a year. For example, if a company has a 17 percent CFROI and the \nmedian is 6 percent, the spread would be 11 percentage points and the company would be in the highest quintile. \nWe then follow the CFROI for each of the 5 cohorts for 10 years. There is modest regression toward the mean. The \nspread from the highest to the lowest quintile shrinks from 18 to 9 percentage points.  \n \nExhibit 2: Regression toward the Mean for CFROI \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: Global companies excluding the financial services and utilities sectors; no size limit; Data reflects fiscal years; updated as of September 19, 2016. \n \nBase Rates of CFROI by Sector \n \nWe can refine our analysis by examining CFROI at the sector level. This reduces the size of the sample but \nincreases its relevance. We present a guide for calculating the rate of regression toward the mean, as well as the \nproper mean to use, for ten sectors. \n \nExhibit 3 examines operating margin in the consumer staples and energy sectors. The panels at the top show the \npersistence of CFROI for the consumer staples sector. On the left, we see that the correlation coefficient (r) \nbetween CFROI from one year to the next is 0.89, and on the right we observe that the correlation between the \ncurrent year and four years in the future is 0.78.  \n \nThe panels at the bottom of exhibit 3 show the same relationships for the energy sector. On the left, we see that the \ncorrelation between CFROI from one year to the next is 0.64, and on the right we observe that the correlation \nbetween the current year and four years in the future is just 0.35. Intuitively, you would expect that a sector with \nstable demand, such as consumer staples, would have a higher r than an industry exposed to commodity markets, \nsuch as energy. This is precisely what the data show. \n \n \n \n \n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nCFROI Minus Median (Percent)\nYear\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n85 \nExhibit 3: Correlation Coefficients for CFROI in Consumer Staples and Energy, 1983-2015 \n \n \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT.  \nNote: Global companies, live and dead, with market capitalizations of $250 million-plus scaled; Winsorized at 1st and 99th percentiles. \n \nNote that the correlation coefficient for the four-year change in CFROI is higher than what you would expect \nby looking solely at the r for the one-year change. Take consumer staples as an illustration. Say a company \nhas a CFROI that is 10 percentage points above average. Using the one-year r, you\u2019d forecast the excess \nCFROI spread in 4 years to be 6.3 (0.894 * 10 = 6.3). But using the four-year r, you\u2019d forecast the spread to \nbe 7.8 (0.78 * 10 = 7.8). So using a one-year correlation coefficient overstates the rate of regression toward \nthe mean.3 \n \nExhibit 4 shows the average correlation coefficient for the four-year change in CFROI for ten sectors from \n1983-2015, as well as the standard deviation for each series. There are two aspects of the exhibit worth \nemphasizing. The first is the ranking of r from the highest to the lowest. This provides a sense of the rate of \nregression toward the mean by sector. Consumer-oriented sectors are generally at the top of the list, and \nthose sectors that have exposure to commodities tend to be at the bottom.  \n \nAlso important is how the r\u2019s change from year to year. While the ranking is reasonably consistent through \ntime, there is a large range in the standard deviation of r for each sector.

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n87 \nEstimating the Mean to Which Results Regress  \n \nThe second issue we must address is the mean, or average, to which results regress. For some measures, \nsuch as sports statistics and the heights of parents and children, the means remain relatively stable over time. \nBut for other measures, including corporate performance, the mean can change from one period to the next. \n \nIn assessing the stability of the mean, you want to answer two questions. The first is: How stable has the \nmean been in the past? In cases where the average has been consistent over time and the environment isn\u2019t \nexpected to change much, you can safely use past averages to anticipate future averages. \n \nThe blue lines in the middle of each chart of exhibit 6 are the mean (solid) and median (dashed) CFROI for \neach year for the consumer staples and energy sectors. The consumer staples sector had an average CFROI \nof 9.3 percent from 1983-2015, with a standard deviation of 0.6 percent. The energy sector had an average \nCFROI of 4.9 percent, with a standard deviation of 1.7 percent over the same period. So the CFROI in the \nenergy sector was lower than that for consumer staples and moved around a lot more.  \n \nIt comes as no surprise that the CFROI for energy is lower and more volatile than that for consumer staples. \nThis helps explain why regression toward the mean in energy is more rapid than that for consumer staples. \nYou can associate high volatility and low CFROIs with low valuation multiples, and low volatility and high \nCFROIs with high valuation multiples. This is what we see empirically for these sectors. \n \nAlso in exhibit 6 are gray dashed lines that capture the CFROI for the 75th and 25th percentile companies \nwithin the sector. If you ranked 100 companies in a sector from 100 (the highest) to 1 (the lowest) based on \nCFROI, the 75th percentile would be the CFROI of company number 75. So plotting the percentiles allows you \nto see the dispersion in CFROIs for the sector. Appendix B shows the same chart for all ten sectors.  \n \nAnother way to show dispersion is with the coefficient of variation, which is the standard deviation of the \nCFROIs divided by the mean of the CFROIs. The coefficient of variation for 1983-2015 was 0.07 for \nconsumer staples and 0.34 for energy. For every 100 basis points of CFROI, there\u2019s much more variance in \nenergy than in consumer staples.  \n \nExhibit 6: Mean and Median CFROI and 75th and 25th Percentiles \u2013 Consumer Staples and Energy  \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: Global companies, live and dead, with market capitalizations of $250 million-plus scaled; Winsorized at 1st and 99th percentiles. \n \n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1983\n1991\n1999\n2007\n2015\nCFROI (Percent)\nConsumer Staples\n75th %\nMean\nMedian\n25th %\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1983\n1991\n1999\n2007\n2015\nCFROI (Percent)\nEnergy\n75th %\nMean\nMedian\n25th %\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n88 \nThe second question is: What are the factors that affect the mean CFROI? For example, the CFROI for the \nenergy sector might be correlated to swings in oil prices, or returns for the financial sector might be dictated \nby changes in regulations. Analysts must answer this question sector by sector. \n \nAs regression toward the mean is a concept that applies wherever correlations are less than perfect, thinking \nabout this second question can frame debates. Currently, for instance, there\u2019s a contested debate about \nwhether operating profit margins in the U.S. are sustainable.16 The answer lies in what factors drive the level \nof profit margins\u2014including labor costs, depreciation expense, financing costs, and tax rates\u2014and what is \nhappening to each. There will obviously be regression toward the mean for the operating profit margins of \ncompanies within a sector or industry. The question is whether aggregate profit margins will decline in coming \nyears following a strong rise since the depths of the recession.   \n \nExhibit 7 presents guidelines on the rate of regression toward the mean, as well as the proper mean to use, \nfor ten sectors based on more than twenty years of data. \n \nExhibit 7: Rate of Regression and toward What Mean CFROIs Revert for Ten Sectors, 1983-2015  \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: \u201cStandard deviation\u201d is the standard deviation of the annual average CFROI for the sector; Includes global companies, live and dead, with market \ncapitalizations of $250 million-plus scaled; Winsorized at 1st and 99th percentiles. \n \nThe second column shows the average correlation coefficient, r, based on four-year changes in CFROI for \neach sector from 1983-2015. These correlations tend to be reasonably stable and hence are a useful \napproximation for the rate of regression toward the mean over a multi-year period. You can plug these r\u2019s into \nthe formula to forecast expected outcomes. Remember that regression works on a population, not necessarily \non every individual company. \n \nThe third and fourth columns of the exhibit show the historical medians and means, and the fifth column \nshows the standard deviation of the annual means. We show medians as well as means because the CFROIs \nin many of these sectors do not match a normal distribution. Still, you can use the means and medians \ninterchangeably in most cases as they tend to be close to one another.  \n \nIn some sectors, including consumer staples and consumer discretionary, the mean CFROIs are stable. Others, \nincluding information technology and telecommunication services, have a great deal of volatility. For sectors \nwith CFROIs that have a low standard deviation, it is reasonable to assume that the historical mean is the \nnumber to which CFROIs regress.  \nHow Much  Regression?\nSector\nFour-Year Correlation \nCoefficient\nMedian (%) Average (%)\nStandard \nDeviation (%)\nCoefficient  \nof Variation\nConsumer Staples\n0.78\n8.1\n9.3\n0.6\n0.07\nConsumer Discretionary\n0.67\n8.0\n9.1\n0.6\n0.07\nHealth Care\n0.64\n8.3\n7.6\n1.1\n0.15\nIndustrials\n0.62\n6.7\n7.6\n1.0\n0.12\nUtilities\n0.57\n3.5\n4.1\n0.8\n0.20\nTelecommunication Services\n0.55\n5.7\n5.3\n1.4\n0.27\nInformation Technology\n0.50\n8.5\n9.0\n1.6\n0.18\nFinancials\n0.43\n7.5\n8.3\n1.5\n0.18\nMaterials\n0.41\n4.6\n4.7\n0.9\n0.19\nEnergy\n0.35\n5.0\n4.9\n1.7\n0.34\nToward What  Mean?\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n96 \nThe Value of a Framework under Adversity \n \nA key part of successful investing is the ability to keep emotions in check in the face of adversity. One \nexample, the focus of this report, is when one of the stocks in your portfolio drops sharply. If you are the \nportfolio manager, you might feel frustrated, upset about the hit to returns, and worried about the business \nimplications. If you are the analyst, you might feel anger, disappointment, and shame. None of those feelings \nare conducive to good decision making.    \n \nThis kind of event precipitates what has been called a \u201cman overboard\u201d moment.1 These moments demand \nimmediate attention, are stressful, and require swift action. In an investment firm it is common for a number of \nprofessionals to stop what they are doing in order to discern a suitable course of action.   \n \nThe use of a checklist is one approach to making good decisions under pressure. In his superb book, The \nChecklist Manifesto, Dr. Atul Gawande describes two types of checklists.2 The first is called DO-CONFIRM. \nHere you do your job from memory but pause periodically to make sure that you have done everything you\u2019re \nsupposed to do. The second is called READ-DO. Here, you simply read the checklist and do what it says. \nREAD-DO checklists are particularly helpful in stressful situations because they prevent you from being \novercome by emotion as you decide how to act.   \n \nYou can think of your emotional state and the ability to make good decisions as sitting on opposite sides of a \nseesaw. If your state of emotional arousal is high, your capacity to decide well is low. A checklist helps take \nout the emotion and moves you toward a proper choice. It also keeps you from succumbing to decision \nparalysis. A psychologist studying emergency checklists in aviation said the goal is to \u201cminimize the need for a \nlot of effortful analysis when time may be limited and workload is high.\u201d3  \n \nThe goal of this report is to provide you with analytical guidance if one of your stocks declines 10 percent or \nmore, relative to the S&P 500, in one day. More directly, we want to answer the question of whether you \nshould buy, hold, or sell the stock following one of these big down moves.     \n \nExhibit 1 shows the number of such observations from January 1990 through mid-2014. There were more \nthan 5,400 occurrences in all, with clusters around the deflating of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and \nthe financial crisis in 2008-2009. The bubble periods contain about 40 percent of the observations. These \nsharp drops happen frequently enough that they deserve a thoughtful process to deal with them but \ninfrequently enough that few investment firms have developed such a process.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

To do this, we calculate the \n\u201ccumulative abnormal return\u201d for the 30, 60, and 90 trading days after the time of the decline. An abnormal \nreturn is the difference between the total shareholder return and the expected return. A stock\u2019s expected \nreturn reflects the change in a broader stock market index, the S&P 500 in our case, adjusted for risk. The \ncumulative abnormal return, then, is simply the sum of the abnormal returns during the period we measure.       \n \nWe refine the large sample into relevant categories in an effort to increase the usefulness of the base rates.4 \nThe first refinement is to segregate earnings and non-earnings announcements. Earnings releases constitute \nabout one-quarter of our sample. Non-earnings announcements include releases of information that are \nscheduled, such as same-store sales updates, as well as unanticipated announcements, including a change in \nmanagement or an earnings warning. In general, the cumulative abnormal returns following disappointing \nearnings releases are worse than for other announcements. \n \nThe second refinement is the introduction of three factors\u2014momentum, valuation, and quality\u2014that consider \ncorporate fundamentals and stock market measures. All companies receive a score for each factor. The \nscores are relative to a company\u2019s peers in the same sector. You can find a detailed definition of the factors in \nAppendix A, but here\u2019s a quick summary: \n \n Momentum predominantly considers two drivers, change in cash flow return on investment (CFROI) as \nthe result of earnings revisions, and stock price momentum. Good momentum is associated with rising \nCFROI and strong stock price appreciation. \n \n Valuation reflects the gap between the current stock price and the warranted value in the HOLT\u00ae model. \nValuation also incorporates adjusted measures of price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. Together, \nthese metrics help assess whether a stock is relatively cheap or expensive.  \n \n Quality captures the company\u2019s recent level of CFROI and whether the company has consistently made \ninvestments that create value. Firms with high CFROIs and strong value creation score well on quality. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n1990\n1993\n1996\n1999\n2002\n2005\n2008\n2011\n2014\nNumber of Observations\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n98 \nThe final refinement is a separation between the full sample and the periods excluding the bubbles. We show \nthe full sample including all events in exhibits 2 and 3, and the narrower sample excluding the bubble periods \nin exhibits 12 and 13. The bubble periods correlate with high volatility in the market, as measured by the \nChicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX). When you compare the full sample to the ex-\nbubble sample for earnings announcements, you will see that the average stock price changes for the \nequivalent branches are directionally the same more than 80 percent of the time. For the other events, the \ndirectional overlap is close to 90 percent.  \n \nThe upside of adding refinements is that you can find a base rate that closely matches the case you are \nconsidering. The downside is that the sample size (N) shrinks with each refinement. We have tried to maintain \nhealthy sample sizes even in the end branches, and we display the Ns along the way so that you can assess \nthe trade-off between fit and prior occurrences. \n \nWe are almost ready to turn to the checklist and numbers, but we need to cover one additional item. All of our \nsummary exhibits show the average, or mean, stock price return. That average represents a full distribution of \nresults. For most of the distributions, the median return\u2014the return that separates the top half from the \nbottom half of the sample\u2014is less than the mean, which suggests the distributions have a right skew.  \n \nFurther, the standard deviations of most of the distributions are in the range of 35-45 percent. While our \nsummary figures show a tidy average, recognize that the figure belies a rich distribution. Appendix B shows \nthe distributions for a handful of events. The base rate data can be extremely helpful in making a sound \ndecision even if the outcome is probabilistic.  \n \nWe\u2019re now ready to turn to the checklist and the numbers that show the base rates. \n \n \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n99 \nThe Checklist \n \nYou come into the office and one of the stocks in your portfolio is down 10 percent or more relative to the \nS&P 500. Here\u2019s what you do: \n \n Earnings or non-earnings. Determine whether the precipitating announcement is an earnings release or \na non-earnings disclosure and go to the appropriate exhibit;  \n \n Momentum. Check the HOLT Lens\u2122 screen to determine if the stock had strong, weak, or neutral \nmomentum going into the announcement. You can either go to the momentum section of the exhibit or \ncontinue;   \n \nValuation. Check to see if the valuation is cheap, expensive, or neutral. You can either go to the section in \nthe exhibit that combines momentum and valuation or continue;   \n \n Quality. Check to see if the quality is high, low, or neutral. Go to section in the exhibit that incorporates all \nof the factors.  \n \nWe have two detailed case studies that we\u2019ll present in a moment, but let\u2019s run through an example to see \nhow this works. The first item is to determine whether the announcement was a scheduled earnings release or \nnot. Let\u2019s say it was an earnings event. That means we would refer to the data in exhibit 2. \n \nStep two is to assess the momentum. We\u2019ll assume that momentum is strong. If you look at the left side of \nthe exhibit you\u2019ll see the section that reflects momentum. If you focus on the results of the companies with \nstrong momentum, you\u2019ll see a few figures. You\u2019ll notice that the 408 stocks in that reference class declined \n14.9 percent, on average, the day of the event. You\u2019ll also see that those stocks modestly underperformed \nthe market, with a cumulative abnormal return of -1.6 percent, in the prior 30 trading days. \n \nYou\u2019ll also see that the stocks in that class struggled in the subsequent quarter, with cumulative abnormal \nreturns of -1.5 percent in the next 30 trading days, -1.9 percent in 60 trading days, and -0.6 percent in 90 \ntrading days. We selected 90 trading days as the extent of this analysis because we felt it is a sufficient \namount of time for an investment team to thoroughly reassess the stock\u2019s merit. We designed the READ-DO \nchecklist to provide immediate guidance.  \n \nWe now turn to valuation, which you can find in the middle of the exhibit, to see if we can sharpen the analysis. \nLet\u2019s assume the valuation was expensive. If we look 60 days out, we see that the 167 stocks in this group \nhave an average cumulative abnormal return of -4.5 percent.    \n \nAs a final check, we consider quality, which you can find on the right of the exhibit. Let\u2019s say quality is high. \nWe\u2019ve now shrunk our sample size to 62, and see that the 60-day cumulative abnormal return is -3.5 percent.    \n"

The following day, March 21, the stock declined from $20.905 \nto $18.20, or 12.9 percent. The S&P 500 was down 0.3 percent. This was a non-earnings event. \n \nSince we use cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for all of the stock performance data, it is worth taking a \nmoment to explain the methodology. We calculate daily abnormal return using a simplified market model, \nwhich compares the actual return of a stock to its expected return. The expected return equals the total \nshareholder return of the benchmark, the S&P 500, times the stock\u2019s beta. The abnormal return is the \ndifference between the actual return and the expected return. \n \nWe calculate beta by doing a regression analysis with the S&P 500\u2019s total returns as the independent variable \n(x-axis) and Symantec\u2019s total returns as the dependent variable (y-axis). We use monthly total returns for the \nprior 60 months. Beta is the slope of the best-fit line. Exhibit 4 shows that the beta for Symantec for the 60 \nmonths ended February 2014 was about 0.8. This is the beta we use for our calculations of daily abnormal \nreturns during the month of March 2014. \n \nExhibit 4: Beta Calculation for Symantec \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \n \n \n \n \n \ny = 0.812x - 0.005\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nSymantec\nS&P 500\nMonthly Returns\nMarch 2009 - February 2014\n"

(Please contact your HOLT or Credit Suisse representative if you do not have access to Lens \nand would like to use it.) At the welcome page, search for the company of the stock under consideration. This \ntakes you to the homepage for that company, which includes a Relative Wealth Chart. Toward the top of the \npage you will find a link called \u201cScorecard Percentile.\u201d If you click on it, you will see numerical scores, from 0 \nto 100, on momentum, valuation, and operational quality, among other items.  \n \nTo best align with the base rates, which reflect factor scores from before the price gain, it is appropriate to use \nthe Scorecard on the day of the event as opposed to the days afterwards. On the day of the event, the factors \ndo not yet incorporate the price gain\u2014HOLT makes those adjustments overnight. For the purposes of this \nanalysis, a score of 66 or more reflects strong momentum, cheap valuation, and high quality. A score of 33 or \nless means weak momentum, expensive valuation, and low quality. Numbers from 34 to 65 are neutral for the \nfactors. Exhibit 6 shows you what this screen looked like for Symantec.   \n \nExhibit 6: Symantec\u2019s Factor Scores \n \nSource: HOLT Lens. \n \nWe see that momentum is weak (23), valuation is cheap (80), and quality is high (71).

Exhibit 10 shows the scores. \n \nExhibit 10: Tenet Healthcare\u2019s Factor Scores \n \nSource: HOLT Lens. \n \nFor Tenet Healthcare, we see that momentum is at the low end of strong (66), valuation is expensive (9), and \nquality is low (4). Despite Tenet Healthcare\u2019s weak stock price in the short term, the overall momentum score \nremained strong because of excellent stock price results, relative to peers, in the 52 weeks leading up to the \nannouncement. While the momentum factor barely qualified as strong, scores for valuation and quality are \nunattractive. Exhibit 11 shows the branches in exhibit 2 that are relevant for Tenet Healthcare.  \n \nExhibit 11: The Branches that Lead to Tenet Healthcare\u2019s Appropriate Reference Class \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \n \nThe cumulative abnormal returns are consistently negative for each branch of the tree for all of the time \nperiods we consider. The final branch, with a sample size of 56 events, shows a -2.9 percent CAR for 30 days, \n-6.3 percent for 60 days, and -1.4 percent for 90 days. In this case, the base rate would suggest selling the \nstock on the day following the decline. \n \nWe can compare these base rates with what actually happened. The CAR for Tenet Healthcare\u2019s shares was  \n-60.9 percent in the 30 trading days following the event, -54.4 percent for 60 days, and -51.2 percent for 90 \ndays. Exhibit 9 reflects these returns. Once again, note that there is a distribution of returns for that reference \nclass, and the best we can do is make a probabilistic assessment.  \nTENET HEALTHCARE CORP Scorecard Analysis\nOverall Percentile\nInvestment Style\nMomentum Trap\nOperational Quality\nMomentum\nValuation\n8\n4\n66\n9\nMomentum\nValuation\nQuality\nDays\n-30\nEvent\nN =\n+30\n+60\n+90\nDays\nDays\n-30\nEvent\nN =\n+30\n+60\n+90\n-30\nEvent\nN =\n+30\n+60\n+90\nStrong\n-1.6% -14.9%\n408\n-1.5% -1.9%\n-0.6%\nExpensive\n-1.2%\n-15.4%\n167\n-2.4% -4.5%\n-3.2%\nLow\n-1.3%\n-14.6%\n56\n-2.9% -6.3% -1.4%\nDays\nDays\nDays\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n109 \nSummary: Buy, Sell, or Hold \n \nThe goal of this analysis is to provide you with useful base rates in the case that you see a sharp drop\u2014a \n\u201cman overboard\u201d moment\u2014in one of the stocks in your portfolio. These base rates are meant to offer some \nguidance in determining whether you should buy, sell, or do nothing the day following the event. You should \nkeep this report handy, and when an event occurs you can pull it out and follow the steps in the checklist. The \nresults contained here are a useful complement to fundamental analysis.   \n \nBecause these events tend to be infrequent, most investors don\u2019t have a systematic approach, or data, to \nmake a sound judgment. Further, large price drops almost always evoke a strong emotional reaction, which \ncomplicates the process of decision making even more.   \n \nOur examination of exhibits 2 and 3 suggests that the following characteristics are consistent with buy and sell \nsignals: \n \nBuy. For earnings releases, there is a clear and convincing buy signal for stocks with weak momentum prior to \nthe event. This buy signal is strengthened if the stock has a cheap valuation and is of high quality.  \n \nThe buy signal for stocks with weak momentum is even more pronounced for non-earnings events than it is \nfor earnings releases, although these stocks had worse shareholder returns leading up to the event. This \nsignal is stronger for stocks that have a cheap valuation, and is further amplified if the companies are of high \nor neutral quality. Symantec, the subject of our first case study, was a non-earnings event with weak \nmomentum, cheap valuation, and high quality, and hence the data suggested a buy. \n \nSell. For earnings releases, momentum alone does not indicate a strong buy or sell pattern. But there is a \nfairly strong sell signal for stocks that have the combination of strong momentum and expensive valuation. The \nsell signal holds for stocks with strong momentum, expensive valuation, and any quality score. Tenet \nHealthcare, our second case, had strong momentum, expensive valuation, and low quality\u2014factors that \nsuggested selling the shares.  \n \nFor non-earnings events, the cumulative abnormal returns following an event are largely positive. But we must \nnote that these stocks as a group performed poorly prior to the event, down more than five percentage points \nrelative to the market. There are a couple of combinations that suggest selling the stock. The strongest sell \nsignal is for companies that combine strong or neutral momentum, expensive valuation, and high quality. \nStrong or neutral momentum and expensive valuation alone do not indicate a sell signal.  \n \nMaking decisions in the face of uncertainty is always a challenge, but it is inherent to investing. Deciding what \nto do with a stock following a sharp decline is particularly difficult because emotions tend to run high after \nthose events. This report provides grounding in the form of base rates in an effort to better inform decisions.  \n \n \n \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n112 \nAppendix A: Definition of the Factors  \n \nMomentum: Momentum is a gauge of market sentiment. Stocks that score well have rising levels of \nexpected CFROI as the result of upward earnings revisions, positive stock price momentum, and good liquidity.  \n CFROI Key Momentum, 13-week (60%) - CFROI Key Momentum measures change in the level of \nexpected CFROI following revisions in consensus earnings per share.  \n Price Momentum (52-week) (30%) - Price Momentum is based on the percentage change in \nmarket value over the past 52 weeks.  \n Daily Liquidity Average (10%) - Daily Liquidity Average reflects the number of shares traded in the \nlast quarter, divided by 63 trading days, multiplied by the stock price at the end of the most recent \nweek, divided by market capitalization.  \n \nValuation: Valuation assesses the difference between the stock\u2019s warranted value, based on the HOLT \nframework\u00ae, and the stock\u2019s current market price. Stocks with the most upside are cheap, and those with the \nleast upside, or downside, are expensive.  \n Percentage Change to Best Price (50%) - Percentage Change to Best Price measures the \ndifference between HOLT\u2019s warranted value and the current stock price. By using a discounted cash \nflow approach that standardizes financial figures, the HOLT model generates values that allow for the \ncomparison of firms across regions, sectors, and accounting standards.  \n Economic P/E (30%) \u2013 Economic P/E is HOLT\u2019s version of a price-to-earnings ratio. You can \ncompare Economic P/E across companies and industries because the value-to-cost ratio is divided by \nCFROI, normalizing results. Specifically, Economic P/E = (Enterprise Value / Inflation Adjusted Net \nAssets) / CFROI. \n Value-to-Cost Ratio (10%) \u2013 Value-to-Cost Ratio is analogous to price/book value, but reflects a \nnumber of adjustments that reduce volatility and better reflect firm value. These include inflation \nadjustments for old plant and inventory in gross investment, capitalized research and development \n(R&D), capitalized operating leases, the reflection of the contingent claim for stock options in debt, \npension debt, preferred stock, and liabilities related to capitalized operating leases. The Value-to-Cost \nRatio = (Market Value of Equity + Minority Interest + HOLT Debt) / Inflation Adjusted Net Assets  \n Dividend Yield (10%) \u2013 Dividend Yield is the dividends paid in the last 12 months divided by the \nmost recent share price.  \n \nQuality: Quality measures a company\u2019s record of generating cash and managing growth, independent of \nexpectations about the future. Firms that score well have high CFROIs and have shown the ability to grow \nprofitable businesses or the willingness to shrink unprofitable ones.  \n CFROI Last Fiscal Year (50%) - CFROI Last Fiscal Year is the ratio of gross cash flow to gross \ninvestment and is expressed as an internal rate of return. We use the CFROI for the last reported \nfiscal year.  \n Managing for Value (30%) - Managing for Value equals the spread between CFROI and the \nDiscount Rate, multiplied by the inflation-adjusted gross investment. This allows us to determine \nwhether the company\u2019s growth creates value and is sustainable. Growth in businesses that earn a \nCFROI in excess of the cost of capital is value creating, while growth in businesses with a negative \nspread destroys value.  \n Change in Value Creation (20%) - Change in Value Creation measures the improvement in \neconomic profit in the most recent fiscal year. A positive value indicates the company either increased \nthe spread between CFROI and the discount rate, or grew in a business with a positive spread. \nChange in Value Creation = (CFROI \u2013 Discount Rate * Growth Rate) \u2013 Prior Fiscal Year Spread. \n \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n119 \nThe Value of a Framework under Success \n \nA key to investing successfully is the ability to manage emotions in the face of highs and lows. The focus of \nthis report is when one of the stocks in your portfolio rises sharply relative to the market and is not an \nacquisition target. As a portfolio manager you are likely to be pleased about the boost to investment returns \nand flush with a sense of success. As the analyst you might feel proud and self-assured. Enjoying \nachievement is fine to a point. But high emotional arousal is not conducive to good decision making.  \n \nA big winner can create what we call a \u201ccelebrating the summit\u201d moment.1 The idea comes from Laurence \nGonzales, an author and expert on survival in extreme situations, who warns against excessive congratulation \nafter reaching a goal.2 He points out that mountain climbers commonly celebrate too much at the peak. This \ncauses them to let their guard down just as they are approaching the part of the expedition that may be the \nmost challenging. Gonzales points out that descent is technically more difficult than ascent and that most \nmountaineering accidents occur on the way down. Likewise, selling can be harder than buying. \n \nYou can use a checklist to help make good decisions when emotions are running high. Atul Gawande \ndescribes two types of checklists in his book, The Checklist Manifesto.3 The first is called DO-CONFIRM. \nHere you do your job from memory but pause periodically to make sure that you have done everything you are \nsupposed to do. The second is called READ-DO. Here, you simply read the checklist and do what it says. \nREAD-DO checklists are particularly helpful when you are in the state of high emotional arousal because they \nprevent you from being overcome by emotion as you decide how to act. \n   \nYou can think of your emotional state and the ability to make good decisions as sitting on opposite sides of a \nseesaw. If your state of emotional arousal is high, your capacity to decide well is low. A checklist helps take \nout the emotion and moves you toward a proper choice. It also keeps you from succumbing to decision \nparalysis. A psychologist studying emergency checklists in aviation said the goal is to \u201cminimize the need for a \nlot of effortful analysis when time may be limited and workload is high.\u201d4   \n \nThis report provides you with analytical guidance if one of your stocks rises 10 percent or more in one day \nrelative to the S&P 500. We limit the analysis to stock price rises unrelated to announced mergers and \nacquisitions (M&A). More directly, we want to answer the question of whether you should buy, hold, or sell the \nstock following one of these big moves to the upside.     \n \nExhibit 1 shows the number of such observations for the S&P 500 from January 1990 through mid-2015. \nThere were roughly 6,800 occurrences, with noteworthy clusters around the dot-com bubble and the financial \ncrisis in 2008-2009. The bubble periods contain 36 percent of the observations. These sharp gains happen \nfrequently enough that they deserve a thoughtful process to deal with them but infrequently enough that few \ninvestment firms have developed such a process. Assuming an average number of stock holdings in a mutual \nfund that is benchmarked against the S&P 500, a portfolio manager of a typical mutual fund would encounter \n5-15 \u201ccelebrating the summit\u201d moments per year in low volatility years (e.g., 1994-1997 and 2012-2015) \nand more than 100 such moments in high volatility years (2000-2002 and 2008-2009). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

To do this, we calculate the \n\u201ccumulative abnormal return\u201d for the 30, 60, and 90 trading days after the time of the increase. An abnormal \nreturn is the difference between the total shareholder return and the expected return. A stock\u2019s expected \nreturn reflects the change in a broader stock market index, the S&P 500 in our case, adjusted for risk. The \ncumulative abnormal return, then, is simply the sum of the abnormal returns during the period that we \nmeasure.       \n \nExhibit 2 shows the results for the full sample. The first thing to note is that weak relative stock price results \ngenerally precede the large positive moves. The stocks in the sample rose nearly 14 percentage points versus \nthe S&P 500 on the event date, but fell almost 6 percentage points relative to the market in the 30 days prior \nto the event. Second, the excess returns following a large price gain are on average strongly positive. \n \nExhibit 2: Full Sample \u2013 Cumulative Abnormal Returns \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \n \nWe refine the large sample into relevant categories in an effort to increase the usefulness of the base rates.5 \nThe first refinement, which exhibit 2 shows, is segregation between earnings and non-earnings events.  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1990\n1993\n1996\n1999\n2002\n2005\n2008\n2011\n2014\nNumber of Observations\nDays\nDays\n-30\nEvent\nN =\n+30\n+60\n+90\n-30\nEvent\nN =\n+30\n+60\n+90\nEarnings\n-3.3%\n14.5%\n1,505\n2.7% 3.7% 4.1%\nFull Sample \n-5.9%\n13.8%\n6,797\n3.5% 6.1% 7.0%\nNon-Earnings\n-6.6%\n13.6%\n5,292\n3.8% 6.8% 7.9%\nDays\nDays\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n121 \nThe full sample of cumulative abnormal returns for earnings events, which constitute about one-fifth of our \nsample, is in exhibit 3. Cumulative abnormal returns for non-earnings announcements, which include releases \nof information that are scheduled, such as same-store sales updates, as well as unanticipated announcements, \nincluding a change in management or an earnings update, are found in exhibit 4. On balance, returns \nsubsequent to non-earnings announcements are greater than those following earnings releases.   \n \nThere is strong evidence in the U.S. markets for \u201cpost-earnings-announcement drift.\u201d6 This is a positive \nrelationship between announced earnings surprises and subsequent stock price changes. For companies that \nreport an upside earnings surprise, cumulative abnormal returns tend to continue to drift up. \n \nThe second refinement is the application of three factors\u2014momentum, valuation, and quality\u2014that consider \ncorporate fundamentals and stock market measures. All companies receive a score for each factor. The \nscores are relative to a company\u2019s peers in the same sector. You can find a detailed definition of the factors in \nAppendix A of the \u201cManaging the Man Overboard Section\u201d of this book, but here\u2019s a quick summary: \n \n Momentum predominantly considers two drivers, change in cash flow return on investment (CFROI) \nforecasts and stock price momentum. Good momentum is associated with rising CFROI forecasts and \nstrong relative stock price appreciation. \n \n Valuation reflects the gap between the current stock price and the warranted value in the HOLT\u00ae \nvaluation model. Valuation also incorporates adjusted measures of price-to-earnings and price-to-book \nratios. Together, these metrics help assess whether a stock is relatively cheap or expensive.  \n \n Quality captures the company\u2019s recent level of CFROI and whether the company has consistently made \ninvestments that create value. Firms with high CFROIs and strong value creation score well on quality. \n \nThe upside of adding refinements is that you can find a base rate that closely matches the case you are \nconsidering. The downside is that the sample size (N) shrinks with each refinement. We have tried to maintain \nhealthy sample sizes even in the end branches, and we display the Ns along the way so that you can assess \nthe trade-off between fit and prior occurrences. \n \nWe are almost ready to turn to the checklist and numbers, but we need to cover one additional item. All of our \nsummary exhibits show the average, or mean, abnormal shareholder return. That average represents a full \ndistribution of results. For most of the distributions, the median return, the return that separates the top half \nfrom the bottom half of the sample, is less than the mean, which tells you that the distributions are skewed to \nthe right.  \n \nFurther, the standard deviations of most of the distributions are in the range of 30-45 percent. While our \nsummary figures show a tidy average, recognize that the figure belies a rich distribution. The appendix shows \nthe distributions for a handful of events. The base rate data can be extremely helpful in making a sound \ndecision even if the outcome is probabilistic.  \n \nWe\u2019re now ready to turn to the checklist and the base rates. \n \n \n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n122 \nThe Checklist \n \nYou come into the office and one of the stocks in your portfolio is up 10 percent or more relative to the S&P \n500. The move is unrelated to announced M&A. Here\u2019s what you do: \n \n Earnings or non-earnings. Determine whether the precipitating announcement is an earnings release or \na non-earnings disclosure and go to the appropriate exhibit;  \n \n Momentum. Check the appropriate HOLT Lens\u2122 page to determine if the stock had strong, weak, or \nneutral momentum going into the announcement. You can either go to the momentum section of the exhibit \nor continue;   \n \nValuation. Check to see if the valuation is cheap, expensive, or neutral. You can either go to the section in \nthe exhibit that combines momentum and valuation or continue;   \n \n Quality. Check to see if the quality is high, low, or neutral. Go to section in the exhibit that incorporates all \nof the factors.  \n \nWe have two detailed case studies that we\u2019ll present in a moment, but let\u2019s run through an example to see \nhow this works. The first item is to determine whether the announcement was a scheduled earnings release or \nnot. Let\u2019s say it was an earnings event. That means we would refer to the data in exhibit 3. \n \nStep two is to assess the momentum. We\u2019ll assume that momentum is weak. If you look at the left side of the \nexhibit you\u2019ll see the section that reflects momentum. If you focus on the results of the companies with weak \nmomentum, you\u2019ll see a few figures. You\u2019ll notice that the 665 stocks in that reference class increased 15.2 \npercent, on average, the day of the event. You will also see that those stocks greatly underperformed the \nmarket, with a cumulative abnormal return of -5.7 percent in the prior 30 trading days.  \n \nYou\u2019ll also see that the stocks in that class did well in the subsequent period, with cumulative abnormal returns \nof 4.1 percent in the next 30 trading days, 4.7 percent in 60 trading days, and 5.2 percent in 90 trading days. \nWe selected 90 trading days as the extent of this analysis because we felt it is a sufficient amount of time for \nan investment team to thoroughly reassess the stock\u2019s merit. We designed the READ-DO checklist to provide \nimmediate guidance.  \n \nWe now turn to valuation, which you can find in the middle of the exhibit, to see if we can sharpen the analysis. \nLet\u2019s assume the valuation was expensive. If we look 60 days out, we see that the 164 instances in this \ngroup have an average cumulative abnormal return of 5.7 percent.    \n \nAs a final check, we consider quality, which you can find on the right of the exhibit. Let\u2019s say quality is low. \nWe\u2019ve now shrunk our sample size to 72, and see that the 60-day cumulative abnormal return is 12.6 percent.    \n"

The stock rose 10.7 percent that day, from $58.62 to $64.90. The \nS&P 500 was down 0.4 percent. This was a non-earnings event. \n \nSince we use cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for all of the stock performance data, it is worth taking a \nmoment to explain how we do the calculation. We determine daily abnormal return using a simplified market \nmodel, which compares the actual return of a stock to its expected return. The expected return equals the \ntotal shareholder return of the benchmark, the S&P 500, times the stock\u2019s beta. The abnormal return is the \ndifference between the actual return and the expected return. \n \nWe calculate beta by doing a regression analysis with the S&P 500\u2019s total returns as the independent variable \n(x-axis) and Harman\u2019s total returns as the dependent variable (y-axis). We use monthly total returns for the \nprior 60 months. Beta is the slope of the best-fit line. Exhibit 5 shows that the beta for Harman for the 60 \nmonths ended July 2013 was 2.2. This is the beta we use for our calculations of daily abnormal returns during \nthe month of August 2013. Similarly, the beta for September 2013 would use returns for the 60 months \nended August 2013. \n \nExhibit 5: Beta Calculation for Harman \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \n \n \ny = 2.21x + 0.00\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nHarman International Industries\nS&P 500\nMonthly Returns\nAugust 2008 - July 2013\n"

      "text": "September 26, 2016  \n \nThe Base Rate Book \n132 \nSummary: Buy, Sell, or Hold \n \nThe goal of this analysis is to provide you with useful base rates in the case that you see a sharp gain in one \nof the stocks in your portfolio. Mountain climbers run a risk of \u201ccelebrating the summit,\u201d enjoying the pleasure \nwithout considering the rest of the journey. Likewise, investors should not bask in their success but rather \nconsider their next action. \n \nThe base rates in this report offer guidance in determining whether you should buy, sell, or do nothing in the \ndays following the event. You should keep this report handy, and when an event occurs you can pull it out and \nfollow the steps in the checklist. The results contained here are a useful complement to fundamental analysis.   \n \nBecause these events tend to be infrequent, most investors don\u2019t have a systematic approach, or data, to \nmake a sound judgment. Further, large price increases almost always evoke a strong emotional reaction, \nwhich complicates the process of decision making even more.   \n \nOur examination of exhibits 3 and 4 suggests that the following characteristics are consistent with buy and sell \nsignals: \n \nBuy. For earnings releases, there is a clear and convincing buy signal for stocks with weak or neutral \nmomentum prior to the event. This buy signal is strengthened if the stock has a cheap or neutral valuation.  \n \nThe buy signal for stocks with weak momentum is even more pronounced for non-earnings events than it is \nfor earnings releases. This signal is stronger for stocks that have a cheap valuation, and is further amplified if \nthe companies are of high or neutral quality, although the returns for low quality are still very high. Harman, \nthe subject of our first case study, was a non-earnings event with weak momentum, cheap valuation, and low \nquality, and hence the data suggested a buy. \n \nSell. For earnings releases, momentum alone does not indicate a strong buy or sell pattern. But there is a \nfairly strong sell signal for stocks that have the combination of strong momentum and expensive valuation. The \nsell signal holds for stocks with strong momentum, expensive valuation, and high or neutral quality. W.W. \nGrainger, our second case, had strong momentum, expensive valuation, and high quality\u2014factors that \nsuggested selling the shares.  \n \nFor non-earnings events, the cumulative abnormal returns following an event are largely positive. But we must \nnote that these stocks as a group performed poorly prior to the event, down nearly seven percentage points \nrelative to the market. There are a couple of combinations that suggest selling the stock. The strongest sell \nsignal is for companies that combine strong momentum and expensive valuation. That signal is further \namplified if the companies are of high or neutral quality. \n \nMaking decisions in the face of uncertainty is always a challenge, but it is inherent to investing. Deciding what \nto do with a stock following a sharp increase is particularly difficult because emotions tend to run high after \nthese events. This report provides grounding in the form of base rates in an effort to better inform decision \nmaking. \n"

This is the second branch of the Harman case study. \n \nExhibit 15 shows the final branch in the Harman case study: weak momentum, cheap valuation, and low \nquality. The sample size is just over one-third of the prior branch. You can see the 30 trading days prior to the \nevent, the day of the event itself, and the 30, 60, and 90 trading days after the event. \n \n \n \n \n"

Madden, CFROI Valuation: A Total System Approach to Valuing the Firm (Oxford, UK: \nButterworth-Heinemann, 1999). \n2 HOLT uses a three-step process to fade the CFROI of all firms. The first step is the explicit fade period, \nwhere the model fades the CFROI for a company over the next five years based on its position in the \ncorporate life cycle. The second step is the residual period, where the model eliminates ten percent of the \neconomic spread per year. The economic spread is the difference between the CFROI and the long-term \naverage. The final step is the terminal period, where the model assumes the company earns a return on \ncapital equal to the cost of capital and that the level of earnings will continue into perpetuity.  \n3 In theory, this is not the best way to model this problem. The equation we present is relevant mostly for one-\ntime adjustments. See John R. Nesselroade, Stephen M.
