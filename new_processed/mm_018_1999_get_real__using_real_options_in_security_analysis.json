Newly unregulated mar-\nkets are contributing to greater uncertainty. If-it-ain\u2019t-broke-don\u2019t-fix-it is giving\nway to break-it-before-someone-else-does.\nThe breakneck pace of change and elevated uncertainty demand new ways of\nstrategic thinking and new tools for financial analysis. Real options are at the\ncore of such a strategic and financial framework.\nWe believe that real options will become an increasingly important tool in secu-\nrity analysis. Real options provide the analytical flexibility that standard valuation\nframeworks lack. The major points of our analysis are as follows:\n\u2022 \nReal options defined. The real options approach applies financial option\ntheory\u2014the best-known form is the Black-Scholes model\u2014to real invest-\nments, such as manufacturing plants, line extensions, and R&D investments.\nThis approach provides important insights about businesses and strategic in-\nvestments, insights that are more important than ever given the rapid pace\nof economic change.\n\u2022 \nThe marriage of strategic intuition and analytical rigor. The real options ap-\nproach is best viewed as a complement to standard DCF analysis. For those\ncomfortable with DCF, real options have substantial intuitive appeal. By\nadding an important dimension of analytical flexibility, real options allow for a\nbetter melding of strategic intuition and analytical rigor.\n\u2022 \nEvolution of strategy and finance. Most traditional businesses can be valued\nusing DCF, as the general focus is optimization\u2014doing things better today\nthan yesterday. Emerging businesses are best valued using real options, as\nthe focus is on \u201cthe next big thing.\u201d As the strategic landscape evolves, so\ntoo must the tools to evaluate it.\n\u2022 \nWhere real options apply. The real options approach is particularly relevant\nwhen three elements are in place. The first is a smart management team, fo-\ncused on creating, identifying, and exercising real options. Next are market-\nleading businesses, which tend to get the best look at strategic opportunities\nand can offer economies of scale and scope. Finally, uncertain markets are\nwhere options are most valuable.\n\u2022 \nImproving valuation thinking. We suggest that stocks of companies that par-\nticipate in highly uncertain markets are best viewed as a combination of the\ndiscounted cash flow value of the current, known businesses plus a portfolio\nof real options. This real option can be estimated by taking the difference\nbetween the current equity value and the DCF value for the established\nbusinesses.\n"

This contrasts with business leaders focused on maintaining the\nstatus quo or maximizing near-term accounting earnings. Businesses that are\nmarket leaders are also attractive, as they often have the best information flow\nand richest opportunities\u2014often linked to economies of scale and scope.

      "text": "Get Real\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nReal Options Defined\nReal options analysis extends financial option theory to options on real, or nonfi-\nnancial, assets. A financial option gives its owner the right\u2014but not the obliga-\ntion\u2014to purchase or sell a security at a given price. Analogously, a company that\nhas a real option has the right\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to make a potentially\nvalue-accretive investment. Investment examples include new plants, line exten-\nsions, joint ventures, and licensing agreements.\nThis approach is best viewed as a complement to standard DCF. 1  For those\ncomfortable with the DCF model, real options have substantial intuitive appeal.\nBy adding an important dimension of analytical flexibility, real options allow for a\nbetter melding of strategic intuition and analytical rigor. Further, as real option\npricing models rely heavily on financial market data, the framework is closely\naligned with the real world.2\nThere are three areas in particular where traditional DCF, most widely articulated\nas the net present value rule (NPV)3, comes up short versus options theory:\n\u2022 \nFlexibility. Flexibility is the ability to defer, abandon, expand, or contract an\ninvestment. Because the NPV rule does not factor in the value of uncer-\ntainty, it is inherently less robust than an options approach in valuing flexibil-\nity. For example, a company may choose to defer an investment for some\nperiod of time until it has more information on the market. The NPV rule\nwould value that investment at zero, while the real options approach would\ncorrectly allocate some value to that investment\u2019s potential.\n\u2022 \nContingency. This is a situation when future investments are contingent on\nthe success of today\u2019s investment. Managers may make investments to-\nday\u2014even those deemed to be NPV negative\u2014to access future investment\nopportunities. Traditional budgeting models inadequately value these option-\ncreating investments. Pharmaceutical company investments are a good ex-\nample. Future spending on drug development is often contingent on the\nproduct clearing certain efficacy hurdles. This is valuable because invest-\nments can be made in stages, rather than all up-front.\n\u2022 \nVolatility. Somewhat counterintuitively, investments with greater uncertainty\nhave higher option value. In standard finance, higher volatility means higher\ndiscount rates and lower net present values. In options theory, higher volatil-\nity\u2014because of asymmetric payoff schemes\u2014leads to higher option value.4\nIn a sense, real options theory allows us to value the unimaginable. This\nmeans that industries with high uncertainty\u2014like the Internet\u2014actually have\nthe most valuable options.\n                                                  \n1 In fact, real option value and DCF value are equal when one assumes that there are no changes in\nmanagerial decisions across outcome ranges and that cash flow forecasts equal the average of an ex-\npected probability range.\n2 Amram, Martha; Kulatilaka, Nalin, \u201cDisciplined Decisions: Aligning Strategy with the Financial Markets,\u201d\nHarvard Business Review, January-February 1999.\n3 The NPV rule compares current investment outlays to the present value of an investment\u2019s future cash\nflows.\n4 See Appendix A.\n"

The binomial model describes price movements over time,\nwhere the asset value can move to one of two possible prices with associated\nprobabilities. It is not necessary to delve into the math to intuitively understand\nhow the binomial model works.5\nFigure 1 represents the binomial process through a decision tree. Since an op-\ntion represents the right but not the obligation to make an investment, the payoff\nscheme to the option-holder is asymmetric. In other words, options are only ex-\nercised if they have a positive value and are left unexercised if worthless. A brief\nstudy of the decision tree shows that time and the range of outcomes are key to\noption value.\nFigure 1\nThe Binomial Model\nStart\nGood\nGood, Good\nGood, Bad\nBad, Good\nBad, Bad\nBad\np1\np2\n(1 - p1)\n(1 - p3)\np3\n(1 - p2)\nT = 0\n                 T = 1\n               T = 2\nSource: Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation.\nThe range of potential outcomes is a particularly important dimension in option\nvalue. This range has been dubbed the \u201ccone of uncertainty,\u201d6 and can be recast\nvisually as a more familiar bell-shaped distribution. (See Figure 2.) Wider out-\ncome distributions\u2014higher volatility\u2014lead to higher option value.\n                                                  \n5 The math behind the binomial model is based on the value of a replicating portfolio that combines risk-\nfree borrowing (or lending) with the underlying asset to create the same cash flows as the option. Once\nthe terms of the replicating portfolio are defined, arbitrage principles apply, and the option price has to\nequal the value of the replicating portfolio. It is in this way that the binomial model relies on financial\nmarkets.\n6 Real Options, Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka, Harvard Business School Press, 1999.\n"

Once identified, these options can be assessed and exercised (if\nappropriate), starting the cycle of value creation and new options all over gain. It\nis the managers and investors who understand the value of these options who\nwill gain the greatest insight into true business potential.\nAlthough real options exist in most businesses, they are not always easy to iden-\ntify. Real options can be classified into three main groups: Invest/grow options,\ndefer/learn options, and disinvest/shrink options.10 In turn, real options can be\nfurther defined within these broader headings. We list here seven common real\noptions. (See Figure 5.) We define them separately; however, it should be noted\nthat many options are interrelated. What follows is a starting checklist:\nInvest/Grow Options\n\u2022 \nScale up. This is where initial investments scale up to future value-creating\nopportunities. Scale-up options require some prerequisite investments. For\nexample, a distribution company may have valuable scale-up options if the\nserved market grows.\n\u2022 \nSwitch up. A switch\u2014or flexibility\u2014option values an opportunity to switch\nproducts, process, or plants given a shift in the underlying price or demand\nof inputs or outputs. One example is a utility company that has the choice\nbetween three boilers: natural gas, fuel oil, and dual-fuel. Although the dual-\nfuel boiler may cost the most, it may be the most valuable, as it allows the\ncompany to always use the cheapest fuel.\n\u2022 \nScope up. This option values the opportunity to leverage an investment\nmade in one industry into another, related industry. This is also known as\nlink-and-leverage.11 A company that dominates one sector of e-commerce\nand leverages that success into a neighboring sector is exercising a scope-\nup option.\nDefer/Learn\n\u2022 \nStudy/start. This is a case where management has an opportunity to invest in\na particular project, but can wait some period before investing. The ability to\nwait allows for a reduction in uncertainty, and can hence be valuable. For\nexample, a real estate investor may acquire an option on a parcel of land\nand exercise it only if the contiguous area is developed.\nDisinvest/Shrink Options\n\u2022 \nScale down. Here, a company can shrink or downsize a project in midstream\nas new information changes the payoff scheme. An example would be an\nairline\u2019s option to abandon a nonprofitable route.\n\u2022 \nSwitch down. This option places value on a company\u2019s ability to switch to\nmore cost-effective and flexible assets as it receives new information.\n\u2022 \nScope down. A scope-down option is valuable when operations in a related\nindustry can be limited or abandoned based on poor market conditions and\nsome value salvaged. A conglomerate exiting a sector is an example.\n                                                  \n10 \u201cHow Much Is Flexibility Worth?\u201d Thomas E. Copeland and Philip T.

The second is use of the options model\nitself. Finally, consideration must be given to the potential differences between\noption-model-derived value and real-world value.\nDefining the application is probably the most important part of a real options\nanalysis. Amram and Kulatilaka break the defining task into four parts: the deci-\nsion, the uncertainty, the decision rule, and the review. (See Table 3.)\nTable 3\nDefining the Application\n4 The Decision\n\u2022 What are the possible decisions?\n\u2022 When might they be made?\n\u2022 Who is making them?\n4 The Uncertainty\n\u2022 What is the source?\n\u2022 What is the trend?\n\u2022 How has it evolved?\n\u2022 What other market factors are important?\n4 The Decision Rule\n\u2022 Create a mathematical expression\n4 Look to the Financial Markets\n\u2022 Is uncertainty private or market-priced?\n\u2022 Are there better alternate frames?\n4 Review for Transparency and Simplicity\n\u2022 Is the application definition clear?\n\u2022 Can managers understand the definition?\n\u2022 Is the definition clear to investors?\nSource: Real Options, Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka, Harvard Business School Press, 1999.\nAppropriate definition is a difficult balancing act. Managers and investors have to\nmeld some intuition about the business with a model that maintains a degree of\nrigor. Pinpoint precision is neither an appropriate goal nor a likely outcome of the\nmodel: the thought process alone is valuable and leads to potentially important\ninsights and opportunities.\nThe next step is the actual options pricing model. Although the five Black-\nScholes inputs are relatively straightforward in principle\u2014and are largely familiar\nto DCF users\u2014option-pricing models can get very complex.12 Further, many real\noptions are intertwined: options on options.

Using this ap-\nproach, numerous financial analysts and pundits have concluded that many\nstocks\u2014especially those that compete in rapidly growing, uncertain markets\u2014\nare substantially overvalued. We believe that such an analysis is incomplete be-\ncause it ignores the potentially meaningful value of imbedded real options.\nWe suggest that stocks of companies that participate in highly uncertain markets\nare best viewed as a combination of the discounted cash flow value of the cur-\nrent, known businesses plus a portfolio of real options. This real option can be\nestimated by taking the difference between the current equity value and the DCF\nvalue for the established businesses. Although reasonable people may disagree\nabout the value of the imbedded real options, we believe that overlooking their\nexistence is a major analytical mistake. Is it valuing the unimaginable? Yes. Is\nthe unimaginable valuable? Yes.\nThis thinking extends to the issue of volatility. Market watchers assume that real-\noption-laden businesses are extremely volatile because of the risk in their known\noperations. As a result, analysts generally assume unduly high costs of capital in\ntheir discounted cash flow models.\nWe believe the reality of the market is a little subtler. There are two factors at\nplay: the risk in the known businesses and the swings in option value. As noted\nearlier, option values are very sensitive to changes in underlying asset values\nand time. Table 4 provides numerical support. As an example, an out-of-the-\nmoney call is four times more valuable ($28 versus $7) with a five-year life than\nwith a one-year life.15 So as expectations about current businesses shift\u2014by ex-\ntension affecting the options they support\u2014the market values of real-option-rich\ncompanies swing wildly. The resulting high share price volatility speaks more to\nchanges in option value than to current business value.\nTable 4\nSensitivities of Various Option Values\ncall option with a 5% risk-free rate, $100 strike, and 45% annual volatility\nNet Present Value Ratio\nTime (years)\n0.75\n1.0\n1.25\n1\n$7.10\n$19.90\n$37.95\n3\n19.25\n36.65\n54.85\n5\n28.00\n46.25\n66.45\nNote: Net present value ratio = PV of asset FCF/investment.\nThis means that the discount rates suggested by the capital asset pricing model,\nwhich relies heavily on beta, are vastly overstating the risk of the core busi-\nnesses of real-options-imbued businesses. Using more pedestrian discount rates\nin valuing the known businesses leads to more reasonable valuations both for\nthe core businesses and the embedded options.\n                                                  \n15 Given the assumptions laid out in Table 4.\n"

CSFB cable analyst Laura Martin used real op-\ntions analysis to value this additional capacity.\nOf the 750 MHz available in an upgraded cable system, approximately 648 MHz\nare being used for four visible revenue streams (analog video, digital video,\nhigh-speed data, and telephone). Figure 6 includes a diagram of the typical uses\nfor 750 MHz cable plant.\nWe refer to the remaining 102 MHz as the \u201cStealth Tier.\u201d It is the tier of future\ninteractive services that do not exist today. However, lack of visibility does not\nmean a lack of value.\nThe Stealth Tier could include services such as video telephone, interactive e-\ncommerce, interactive games, and any other application that requires enormous\namounts of bandwidth.

Enron sees op-\nportunity. And management uses real options as a key analytical guide in its tur-\nbulent markets. In fact, real options thinking is the only way to fully appreciate\nEnron\u2019s strategy given its markets and management philosophy.\nLast year, electricity prices briefly surged from $40 to an unprecedented $7,000\nper megawatt hour in parts of the Midwest.17 Although the magnitude of this jump\nwas unusual, a combination of capital intensity, transmission constraints, a lack\nof storage capability, deregulation, and always-uncertain weather has led to a\nsecular increase in electricity price volatility. Enron learned from the events of\n1998. Management realized that its diverse skills and meaningful resources\nmade it uniquely positioned to capitalize on this volatility and immediately began\nwork on a \u201cpeaker\u201d plant strategy. Real options showed the way.\nThis summer, Enron is slated to open three \u201cpeaker\u201d plants\u2014gas-fired electricity-\ngenerating facilities that have production costs 50-70% higher than the industry\u2019s\nfinest. The plants, situated at strategic intersections between gas pipelines and\nthe electric grid, are licensed to run only 1,200 hours per year but are much\ncheaper to build than a normal facility. In effect, they serve as the equivalent of\nunderground storage in the gas business: they start up when electricity prices\nreach peak prices.\nReal options analysis demonstrated that the flexibility of the peakers is more\nvaluable than their relative inefficiency, given ENE\u2019s wholesale businesses and\nrisk management capabilities. Supporting Enron\u2019s efforts to develop its overall\nenergy merchant business, options offer a more robust analytical framework than\nmore traditional tools.\n                                                  \n17 Coy, Peter, \u201cExploiting Uncertainty,\u201d Business Week, June 7, 1999.\n"

These arrangements are particularly\nprominent in the pharmaceutical industry because of prolonged development\nphases and the difficulty in predicting future cash flows and market conditions.\nGiven these dynamics, NPV techniques do not capture the strategic value of the\nresearch. These deals are best understood and valued as options. Amram and\nKulatilaka developed the following case study:18\nIn late 1997, Biogen announced that it had signed an agreement with Merck to\nhelp it develop and bring to market an asthma drug. Merck paid Biogen $15 mil-\nlion up front, plus the potential of $130 million of milestone payments over sev-\neral years.\nBefore the drug becomes commercially viable, Biogen has to shepherd it through\nthe development process. Along the way, Biogen could face expanded tests, a\nchanging asthma drug market, and the risk of abandonment for safety reasons.\nIn this case, Merck purchased a stream of options, including scale-up and scale-\ndown (abandonment) options. Drug development represents \u201coptions on options,\u201d\nor a series of contingent options. And Merck\u2019s abandonment option must also be\nconsidered. The result is that Merck\u2019s upside is unlimited, while its downside is\ncapped by the payments. Real options analysis revealed that the deal was worth\nmore than the $145 million of up-front and milestone payments that Merck\npledged.19\nFrom Biogen\u2019s perspective, the value of the joint venture is the up-front payment\nplus the expected value of the milestone payments. In effect, Biogen transferred\noptions to Merck that cannot be valued using traditional methods.\nCase Study 4: Amazon.com\u2014An Options Smorgasbord\nNowhere does a real options approach apply more than at a company like Ama-\nzon.com. In fact, options thinking is built into the culture,20 which stresses flexibil-\nity and adaptation. Here is a partial list of the real options at Amazon:\n\u2022 \nScope-up options. Amazon has leveraged its position in key markets to\nlaunch into similar businesses. For example, it used it market-leading book-\nselling platform to move into the music business.

The company is adding capacity that will support\nsignificantly higher sales volumes in current businesses as well as capacity\nin potential new ventures. Management believes the cost of this option is\nattractive when weighed against the potential of disappointing a customer.\n\u2022 \nLearning options. The company has made a number of acquisitions that\nmay provide the platform for meaningful value creation in the future. The\nrecently acquired business Alexa is an example. Alexa offers Web users a\nvaluable service, suggesting useful alternative Web sites. It also tracks user\npatterns. Amazon may be able to use this information to better serve its\ncustomers in the future.\n                                                  \n18 Adapted from Real Options, Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka, Harvard Business School Press,\n1999, pp. 72-3.\n19 Merck has used this valuation method for some time.

For example, a call option on a stock gives\nits owner the right to buy a stock at a fixed price\u2014called an option\u2019s exercise or\nstrike price\u2014regardless of the stock\u2019s market price. A call option, then, is valu-\nable if the stock\u2019s price rises past the exercise price before expiration. However,\nif the stock price falls below the option\u2019s exercise price, the owner will choose not\nto exercise the option so as not to lose money. Thus, an option offers exposure\nto a stock\u2019s upside potential and limits exposure to possible downside.

This is because Nobel Prize-winning work by Fisher Black21 and\nMyron Scholes resolved the precise role of these drivers in options value.22\nThe most obvious determinant of an option\u2019s value is its intrinsic value, or what it\nwould be worth if it were immediately exercised. This amount, defined as the\nstock price less the exercise price, ultimately determines how much money the\noption holder makes.\n\u2022 \nExercise price. The less an investor has to pay to convert an option into a\nmore valuable share, the greater the option\u2019s worth. Thus, a lower exercise\nprice means a more valuable option.\n                                                  \n21 Unfortunately, Fisher Black died in 1995, so he never received the well-deserved honor.\n22 Black, F.; Scholes, M., \u201cThe Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,\u201d Journal of Political\nEconomy, 81 (1973), pp. 637-654.\n"

Because an investor benefits by receiving a more valuable\nshare upon exercising an option, a higher stock price means a more valuable\noption.\n However, an option can still be valuable even if it has no intrinsic value. This is\nbecause the possibility exists that the option can be profitably exercised in the\nfuture.\n The value of this possibility is an option\u2019s time value and is determined by three\nfactors:\n\u2022 \nVolatility. As volatility increases, there is a higher probability that the stock\nwill dramatically increase or decrease in value. Viewed from the perspective\nof the option owner, if the stock has a huge run-up, the option increases in\nvalue from its upside exposure. However, if the stock goes down a lot, the\noption\u2019s downside exposure is limited. This makes option owners prefer high\nvolatility in the price of the underlying stock, as it increases the chance that\nthe option will be very valuable without exposure to large losses.\nWe can represent this concept graphically as well. Scenario A of Figure 9 shows\nan option on a low-volatility stock. This option has a narrow price distribution that\nclusters around the exercise price. In contrast, Scenario B shows a similar option\non a high-volatility stock with a wide price distribution. By overlaying these price\ndistributions over a standard option payoff diagram, we can estimate the prob-\nability that the underlying stocks will rise above the option\u2019s exercise price. The\nlarger shaded area in Scenario B shows that the more volatile the stock, the\nhigher the chance that the option will be profitable. All things equal, then, higher\nstock price volatility translates into a higher time value.\nFigure 9\nA Call Option\u2019s Time Value Increases as Stock Price Volatility Increases\nScenario A: Low stock price volatility\nScenario B: High stock price volatility\nPayoff to call\noption on firm\nX\u2019s shares\nPayoff to \noption on X\nExercise price\n(a)\nProbability\ndistribution of\nfuture price of\nfirm X\u2019s shares\nFirm X share price\nShaded area\nrepresents\ntime value\nPayoff to call\noption on firm\nY\u2019s shares\nPayoff to \noption on Y\nExercise price\n(b)\nFirm Y share price\nProbability\ndistribution of\nfuture price of\nfirm Y\u2019s shares\nShaded area\nrepresents\ntime value\nSource: Principles of Corporate Finance, Richard A.

The longer an option holder has\nbefore expiration, the higher the probability that the stock price will end up\nabove the exercise price. This makes options with long lives more valuable\nthan similar options with short lives.\n\u2022 \nRisk-free rate. This variable enters the equation in a subtle way. Purchasing\nan option gives an investor the right to purchase a share at a fixed price in\nthe future. In essence, an option gives its owner an interest-free loan in the\namount of the exercise price for the length of the option. The value of this\nloan increases with the length of the option life and the risk-free rate. Thus,\nan option\u2019s value increases as the risk-free rate increases.\n"

In part, these\nwould-be Nobel Prize winners were stymied by the lack of advanced mathemat-\nics in classical economics training. Fortunately, we do not need to know how to\nderive the Black-Scholes model to use it. Indeed, we do not even need to know\nthe Black-Scholes formula to understand what value drivers make options valu-\nable. (See Appendix A.)\n In this Appendix, we present the generalized Black-Scholes formula, leaving the\nderivation of the equation to option textbooks.25 We do this so readers can enter\nthe formula into a spreadsheet to value options. Following this presentation, we\nalso walk through an example applying the formula to a sample option.\nThe Black-Scholes Formula\n The Black-Scholes formula values a European call or put option as follows:\n \n(\n)\n)\nN(d\n \ne \nX\n)\nN(d\ne S \n \nCall\n \nof\n \nValue\n2\nT\nr \n -\n1\nT\n \nr - b\n\u2212\n=\n \n(\n)\n)\nN(-d\n \ne \nX\n)\nN(-d\ne S\n- \nPut \n \nof\n \nValue\n2\nT\nr \n -\n1\nT\n \nr - b\n+\n=\n where:\n\u2022 \nS is the stock price of the underlying stock. If we expect the stock to pay\nspecific dividends before the option expires, we should subtract the present\nvalue of those dividends from the stock price and use this \u201cadjusted stock\nprice\u201d as the relevant input for this equation.\n\u2022 \nX is the exercise, or strike, price of the option.\n\u2022 \nr is the risk-free rate.\n\u2022 \nb is the \u201ccost of carry,\u201d defined as risk-free rate minus the dividend yield (q).\n\u2022 \nT is the expected life of the option in years.\n\u2022 \n\u03c32 is the variance of the underlying security.\n\u2022 \nT\nT\n )\n2\n \n(b\n \n)\nX\nS\n( \nln\nd\n2\n1\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n+\n+\n=\n\u2022 \nT\nd \nd\n1\n2\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n=\n These formulae look intimidating, but can be inputted into a spreadsheet for\nautomatic calculation. Note that the function N (parameter) used in the Black-\nScholes formula is mathematical notation for the cumulative normal distribution\nfunction. It can be represented in Excel using the following formula:\n\u201c=NORMDIST(parameter,0,1,TRUE).\u201d\nUsing the Black-Scholes Formula\n To use the Black-Scholes method, we simply enter the properties of an option\ninto the appropriate formula. For example, say a call option has the following\nproperties:\n                                                  \n25  For a clear exposition of the derivation of the Black-Scholes formula, see Hull, John, Options,\nFutures, and Other Derivatives, 3\nrd edition.\n"

The model is based on a replicating\nportfolio that combines risk-free borrowing (lending) with the underlying asset to\ncreate the same cash flows as the option. As there is rarely a market-priced un-\nderlying asset in real options valuation, it is important to be careful to maintain as\nmuch of a financial market link as possible.\nHere is a simple example. We value a European call option with a strike price of\n$50, expected to expire in two periods, on an underlying asset of $50, which is\nexpected to follow a binomial process. We assume a 5% risk-free rate.\nValue of call option = (current value of asset)  x  (option \u2206\u2206)  \u2212\u2212  (borrowing needed\nto replicate the option call value)\nWhere:\n\u2206\u2206 = number of shares in replicating portfolio\nB = amount of borrowing in replicating portfolio\nThe problem can be diagrammed as follows.
