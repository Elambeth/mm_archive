Since 1995, M&A volume has averaged 8 percent of the equity market capitalization in \nthe U.S. and the world. As a result, nearly all companies and investment portfolios will feel the effect of M&A \nat some point.      \nExhibit 1 shows the dollar amount of M&A, as well as M&A as a percentage of market capitalization, from \n1980 to 2016. M&A tends to follow the stock market closely, with more activity when the stock market is up.2 \nVolume in 2016 was down 17 percent versus that of 2015, but remained strong in a historical context. The \noutlook for 2017 is also robust.3\nExhibit 1: U.S. Mergers and Acquisitions, 1980-2016\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n1,800\n2,000\n2,200\n1980\n1984\n1988\n1992\n1996\n2000\n2004\n2008\n2012\n2016\nAs a Percentage of Market Capitalization\n$ Billions\nDollar Amount\nAs a Percentage of Market Capitalization\nSource: Thomson Reuters.\nNote: Dollar amounts are not inflated. U.S. announced domestic mergers; excludes debt tender offers, equity carve-outs, exchange offers, loan \nmodifications, and open market repurchases.\nCompanies that act early in an M&A cycle tend to generate higher returns than those that act later. The first \nmovers enjoy the benefits of a larger pool of targets and cheaper valuations than companies that buy later in \nthe cycle. Cheap and accessible financing prompts action by buyers at the end of the cycle. So do bandwagon \neffects, or what Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, calls the \n\u201cinstitutional imperative.\u201d4  \nEmpirical analysis shows that M&A creates value in the aggregate, but that the seller tends to realize most of \nthat value.5 Exhibit 2 shows a measure that McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, calls \u201cdeal value added.\u201d \nDeal value added is the percentage change in the combined market capitalizations of the buyer and seller from \ntwo days before to two days after the deal is announced. This has averaged about 6 percent over the past 20 \nyears. Deal value added was 8 percent in 2016 and has averaged near 12 percent since the financial crisis. \nThat the sellers realize most of the deal value added suggests that the buyers generally pay a full price for the \ncompanies they acquire.\n"

      "text": "February 27, 2017\nTo Buy or Not To Buy\n4\nAlfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at the Kellogg School of Management, and Mark Sirower, a principal \nwith Deloitte Consulting, explain why creating value through M&A is so challenging for a buyer.6 First, if the \npremium is too large the buyer cannot recoup its investment even if the deal makes strategic sense. Second, \noften competitors can replicate the benefits of a deal or take advantage of the buyer\u2019s lack of focus as it goes \nthrough an integration process. Third, M&A requires payment up front for benefits down the road. This makes \ninvestors legitimately skeptical. Finally, M&A deals are generally costly to reverse.  \nOne comment we hear consistently from executives is that the stock market is short-term oriented and fails to \nrecognize the virtue of the announced deal. Mark Sirower and his colleague, Sumit Sahni, studied this \nassertion. Exhibit 4 summarizes their findings, which are based on an analysis of more than 300 deals.7  \nThe first observation is that about one-third of the deals (103 of 302) result in a stock price for the buyer that \nis initially higher, net of the market\u2019s change. This is consistent with past studies. Next, there is a clear \ncorrelation between the size of the premium the buyer paid, as seen in the column on the right, and the \nannouncement return, located in the middle column. Small premiums lead to positive returns and high \npremiums generate negative returns. \nExhibit 4: The Stock Market Takes a Long-Term View When It Judges M&A\nStock Reaction\nInitial positive\nNumber\nof Deals\nAnnouncement\nReturn\nOne-Year \nReturn\nPremium\n33.1%\n5.6%\nPersistent positive\n25.8%\n103\n52\n5.7%\n4.9%\n30.7%\nFull sample\n302\n-4.1%\n-4.3%\n35.7%\nInitial negative\n199\n-9.2%\n-9.0%\n38.4%\nPersistent negative\n133\n-10.3%\n-24.9%\n40.5%\nSource: Mark L. Sirower and Sumit Sahni, \u201cAvoiding the \u2018Synergy Trap\u2019: Practical Guidance on M&A Decisions for CEOs and Boards,\u201d Journal of \nApplied Corporate Finance, Vol. 18, No. 3, Summer 2006, 85.\nSirower and Sahni revisited the deals one year later to test the accuracy of the market\u2019s initial reaction. Deals \nthat were initially positive stayed positive overall, with a one-year total shareholder return of 4.9 percent. More \nthan half (52 of 103) of the deals that were initially positive remained positive. Deals that were negative stayed \nso on average, with a total shareholder return of -9.0 percent. Two-thirds of the negative deals (133 of 199) \ncontinued to be negative. \nThis suggests that while the market\u2019s initial reaction is not perfect, there does not appear to be a bias. Indeed, \nif there is a bias it is that the market\u2019s reaction is too optimistic, as one-half of the positive deals turned \nnegative but only one-third of the negative deals turned positive.8   \nThe story for buyers should not come across as too dour. There are ways to improve the likelihood of a deal \nbeing successful. One factor that can work in favor of buyers is the source of financing. Research shows that \nthe stock market likes cash deals more than stock deals.10 There are a number of plausible explanations for \nthis. First, you can think of a deal financed with stock as two separate transactions: the buyer sells stock to \nthe public and then uses the proceeds to acquire the target. Managements generally sell stock when it\u2019s \nexpensive, providing the market with a negative signal. \n"

The buyer shares the risk \nand reward with the seller in a stock-for-stock deal. A stock deal is a weaker signal of conviction than a cash \ndeal.11   \nExhibit 5 shows the mix between deals that are all cash and those that are all stock or a combination of cash \nand stock from 1980 to 2016. In recent years, cash deals have been a higher percentage of the total than the \nlong-term average. This reflects sizable cash balances, good access to the debt markets, and the perception \nof many executives that the stocks of their companies remain undervalued. \nExhibit 5: All Cash Deals and All Stock or Combination Deals, 1980-2016\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n1980\n1984\n1988\n1992\n1996\n2000\n2004\n2008\n2012\n2016\nAll Cash\nAll Stock or Combination\nSource: Patrick A. Gaughan, Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructurings \u2013 Fifth Edition (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2011), 577; \nFactSet; Credit Suisse.\nAnother empirical finding is that not all types of deals have the same chance of success. Peter Clark and \nRoger Mills, finance experts who focus on M&A, found that deals they call \u201copportunistic,\u201d where a weak \ncompetitor sells out, succeed at a rate of around 90 percent. \u201cOperational\u201d deals, or cases where there are \nstrong operational overlaps, also have an above-average chance of success. The rate of success varies widely \nfor \u201ctransitional\u201d deals, which tend to build market share, as the premiums buyers must pay to close those \ndeals can be prohibitive. Finally, the success rate of \u201ctransformational\u201d deals, large leaps into different \nindustries, tends to be very low.9 \nAnalysis of the motivation for M&A also reveals a role for management hubris. This creates heated bidding \namong potential buyers and leads to what economists call the \u201cwinner\u2019s curse.\u201d12 The winner\u2019s curse \ndescribes a case when a company is the \u201cwinner\u201d by bidding the highest price for a target but suffers from a \n\u201ccurse\u201d because it overpays. \n"

Clearly, executives do deals in an \neffort to improve their company\u2019s strategic and financial position. But volumes of research show that the \nprimary winners are the sellers, not the buyers. This is consistent with competitive and efficient markets, \nwhere it is common for sellers to earn the economic rents.\nThe empirical research also shows that the stock market is reasonably good at assessing the merit of a deal. \nAs a group, investors have to judge whether the buyer will get more than what it pays for. While the market \ndoes not always get it right, an encouraging point for active investors, there does not appear to be a \nsystematic bias.  \nCertain factors can improve the probability of success from the buyer\u2019s point of view. Having a deal that \nmakes strategic and financial sense is vital. Analysis of deal types can help identify deals with a higher \nprobability of success. How a company pays for a deal is also instructive. Cash deals fare better than stock \ndeals.\nWe now present a checklist for M&A analysis, which provides a consistent, rigorous, and sound way to assess \nthe merit of a deal. To illustrate the concepts, we include our study of 126 deals announced in 2015 and \n2016 between public U.S. companies where the buyer had a market capitalization of $500 million or more.  \nThe checklist is useful for investment managers, sell-side analysts, and companies that seek to create \nshareholder value. We finish our discussion with two detailed case studies. The appendix lists all of the deals \nin our sample. \n"

      "text": "February 27, 2017\nTo Buy or Not To Buy\n7\nThe M&A Checklist\nInvestors should answer the following questions when companies announce a deal:13\n \n\uf403   How material is the deal for the shareholders of the buying and selling companies?\n\uf403   What is the stock market\u2019s likely reaction?\n\uf403   Is the buyer sending a signal by choosing to pay with stock or cash?\n\uf403   What strategic category does the deal fall into?\nHow Material Is the Deal?\nThe first question is whether the deal is likely to have a material impact on shareholder value. Shareholder \nvalue at risk (SVAR) measures the potential risk to shareholders of the buyer in the event that synergies do \nnot materialize. SVAR provides an immediate and accurate assessment of how much a deal is likely to affect \nthe shareholders of the buyer.\nSince SVAR is a percentage measure of the acquirer\u2019s potential downside, it quantifies the extent to which a \ncompany is risking the firm\u2019s value on the deal. Low SVARs suggest limited upside or downside for the buyer. \nHigh SVARs may portend large changes in the buyer\u2019s stock price.14\nTo calculate SVAR you need to determine the premium the buyer pledges and how the buyer intends to pay \nfor the deal. For a cash deal, the SVAR is simply the premium divided by the equity market capitalization of the \nbuyer. In a stock-for-stock deal, the SVAR is the premium divided by the combined market capitalizations of \nthe buyer and seller (including the implied premium). \nHere\u2019s a simple example. Assume the equity market capitalization is $2,000 for the buyer and $800 for the \nseller. The buyer bids $1,000 in cash for the seller, representing a premium of $200, or 25 percent. \nThe SVAR is $200 divided by $2,000, or 10 percent. In other words, the $200 premium is a wealth transfer \nfrom the buyer to the seller if the combined businesses realize no synergies. \nWhat if the deal is financed with stock instead of cash? Generally the seller receives a ratio of shares of the \nbuyer. That means that if there are no synergies, the seller won\u2019t receive what the buyer has pledged.\nThe SVAR in this case is the $200 premium divided by $3,000, or 6.7 percent. The SVAR in a stock-for-\nstock deal is always lower than that for a cash deal because the seller becomes an owner in the combined \nfirm and thus assumes a portion of the risk.15 \nPremium at risk measures the risk that a seller assumes if there are no synergies. In a cash or fixed-value deal, \nthe seller\u2019s risk is only the probability of the deal falling through. In a fixed-share offer, the value the seller \nultimately receives is a function of the buyer\u2019s stock price. If the market perceives that the buyer is overpaying, \nit will drive the buyer\u2019s price down and hence reduce the acquisition value proportionately.\nTo continue with our example, the premium at risk is zero for a cash deal. The premium at risk for a stock deal \nis 33.3 percent because the seller will not receive the full premium in the case that no synergies materialize. \n"

But since there are no synergies, the merged company is still worth $2,800 (the original market value \nof the seller and the buyer). The seller\u2019s value, then, is one-third of $2,800, or $933.33. The seller realizes \nonly 66.7 percent of the premium ($133.33/$200), and 33.3 percent is the premium at risk.    \n \nIf the SVAR is material, you need to spend time assessing the deal carefully. But if the SVAR is small, you \nknow that the economic impact of the deal is modest. Exhibit 6 shows the SVARs for eight recent deals. The \nacquisitions at the top have large SVARs and are very material. The deals toward the bottom have small \nSVARs and hence are much less material.  \n \nExhibit 6: Shareholder Value at Risk (SVAR) for a Sample of Recent Deals\nBuyer\nTarget\nShareholder \nValue at Risk\nHarris Corp.\nExelis\n13.1%\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals\nSynageva BioPharma Corp.\n12.8%\nRevlon\nElizabeth Arden\n8.6%\nAlaska Air Group\nVirgin America\n6.7%\nDanaher Corp.\nPall Corp.\n6.6%\nGlobal Payments\nHeartland Payment Systems\n5.3%\nSchlumberger NV\nCameron International Corp.\n4.5%\nSalesforce.com\nDemandware\n1.8%\nSource: Company disclosures and Credit Suisse.\nThe average SVAR for our sample of deals was 5.5 percent and the median was 3.2 percent. The range of \nSVARs was from -1.1 percent to 27.6 percent. The average premium at risk was 16.1 percent, the median \nwas 9.3 percent, and the mode was zero.\nWhat Is the Stock Market\u2019s Likely Reaction?\nA.T. Kearney, a consulting firm, surveyed investor relations professionals about the metric they believed that \nstakeholders, including executives, sell-side analysts, and investors, care about most in assessing M&A. \nThree-quarters of the respondents said that stakeholders place a \u201cstrong emphasis\u201d on earnings per share \n(EPS) accretion or dilution. EPS accretion or dilution was deemed to be, by far, the most important metric.16 \nThis perception has no empirical foundation. Careful studies show that value creation is largely independent of \nEPS accretion or dilution.17 Most announced M&A deals today are accretive to the EPS of the buying \ncompany. This reflects a change in the accounting rules in 2005 that eliminated the amortization of goodwill, \nwhich used to be a drag on earnings, as well as the fact that low prevailing interest rates provide companies \nwith a cheap source of funding. EPS accretion or dilution provides little or no insight because value creation is \nbased on cash flows rather than accounting measures, and the cost of capital rather than the funding source.\nExhibit 7 shows this with a sample of 95 of the M&A deals we analyzed. The columns categorize deals based \non whether the company said it would be immediately accretive or dilutive to EPS. The column on the right \nshows that 86 percent of the deals are accretive. The rest, found in the center and left columns, are neutral or \ndilutive. \n"

An abnormal \nreturn is the difference between the total shareholder return and the expected return. A stock\u2019s expected \nreturn reflects the change in the S&P 500 index with an adjustment for risk. We define a neutral reaction as \nup or down less than 100 basis points. \nRoughly three-fourths of the deals have a neutral or negative impact on shareholder value, as the top and \nmiddle rows show. The bottom row reveals that 27 percent of the deals in this sample created shareholder \nvalue. The box in the upper right corner shows that almost half of the deals in our sample add to EPS but \nsubtract from value.\nExhibit 7: Anticipated Earnings per Share Effect and Buyer Stock Price Reaction\n \nDilutive\nNeutral\nAccretive\nDown\n4\n2\n45\nNeutral\n3\n0\n15\nUp\n3\n1\n22\nAnticipated EPS Effect\nBuyer Reaction\nSource: Company data, FactSet, and Credit Suisse.\nSo how do you assess a deal\u2019s economic impact on the buyer? Mark Sirower provides a simple formula to \ndetermine whether a deal will add value:18\nNet present value of the deal for the buyer = present value of the synergies \u2013 premium\nThe formula says that a deal is good for the buyer if it gets more than what it pays for. The underlying premise \nis that the seller\u2019s stock price, pre-deal, accurately reflects the present value of the company\u2019s future free \ncash flow. The deal creates value for the buyer only if the synergies from putting the businesses together \nexceed the premium for control the buyer must pay to close the deal. This equation provides more insight into \na deal\u2019s economic virtue than a superficial metric such as accretion to EPS.  \nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the terms in the equation. McKinsey surveyed corporate executives about how \nsuccessful they were in capturing the synergies they anticipated. Exhibit 8 shows the results. There is a clear \ndifference between cost synergies, costs companies save by removing redundancies, and revenue synergies, \nthe anticipated increase in sales from combining businesses. Other forms of synergies have played a less \nsubstantial role historically.19 \n"

Christofferson, Robert S. McNish, and Diane L. Sias, \u201cWhere Mergers Go Wrong,\u201d McKinsey on Finance, Winter 2004, 1-6.\nCost synergies are much more reliable than revenue synergies. About one-third of the executives in the survey \nsaid that their company achieved all or more of the anticipated cost synergies, while one-quarter of the \ncompanies overestimated their cost synergies by 25 percent or more. But roughly 70 percent of mergers fail \nto deliver the anticipated revenue synergies. Common challenges companies cite for synergy realization \ninclude delays in implementing planned actions, underestimation of costs and complexities, and flat-out \noverestimation of synergies.20    \nToday, it is reasonably common for executives to articulate the anticipated benefit of synergies. Managements \nprovided an estimate of synergies in about 60 percent of the deals in our sample. \nYou need to take two steps to translate a synergy estimate into the present value of synergies. First, you need \nto assume that the company pays taxes on the gross synergy amount. For example, if a buyer says that it \nanticipates synergy of $100 and the company\u2019s tax rate is 30 percent, the after-tax value of the synergy is \n$70 ($100 * (1 \u2013 0.30)). Second, you can capitalize the synergy into perpetuity by dividing it by the cost of \ncapital. If we assume our buyer\u2019s cost of capital to be 7 percent, the present value of synergies is $1,000 \n($70/.07).    \nThe next part of the analysis is to determine the premium for control. The premium is the difference between \nthe price a buyer is willing to pay and the prevailing market price prior to any anticipation of a deal. For \nexample, if a stock is trading at $100 and a buyer offers $140, the premium is 40 percent ($40/$100). \nExhibit 9 shows the average deal premium from 1980 to 2016, with each deal receiving an equal weight. \nWhile the premium is generally straightforward to calculate for an individual transaction, the series of \npremiums over time is difficult to aggregate. The current average premium is 43 percent, very close to the \nlong-term mean. Contested deals tend to lead to higher premiums.21 \n"

We used the synergy estimates that the \ncompanies shared in their press releases. We calculated the premium taking into account stock price \nmovement related to rumors prior to the announcement. We had full information for 78 deals. \nA na\u00efve analysis might anticipate that deals accretive to EPS create value, and that dilutive deals destroy value. \nThat heuristic provides woeful guidance. Just 27 percent of accretive deals in our sample create value, and 60 \npercent of dilutive deals are neutral or positive.\nDoes the value creation formula do better? Exhibit 11 shows that the formula correctly predicts the buyer\u2019s \nexcess return 39 percent of the time, markedly better than the simple EPS heuristic. If we focus solely on \nvalue change, the formula is accurate just under one-half of the time. Note that we accept management\u2019s \nestimate of synergy without question, and capitalize them into perpetuity. As a result, the formula tends to \nreflect management optimism. \nWhen we combine the evidence that many companies fail to realize the synergies they hope for and that \noverbidding is common, it comes as no surprise that for roughly one-half of the deals the formula predicts \nvalue creation and the reality is value destruction. In other words, the market does not believe the projections \nof synergies that executives suggest. \nExhibit 11: Anticipated Buyer Reaction Given Present Value of Synergies and Premium Pledged\nDestructive\nNeutral\nCreating\nDown\n9\n7\n25\nNeutral\n0\n4\n7\nUp\n8\n2\n16\nAnticipated Buyer Reaction\nBuyer Reaction\nSource: Company data, FactSet, and Credit Suisse.\nIs the Buyer Sending a Signal by Choosing To Pay with Stock or Cash?\nInvestors must next consider how a company pays for a deal. Whether a buyer uses cash, stock, or a \ncombination can send a signal to the market. There are cases where buyers may use stock because of the \nsize of the transaction or for tax reasons. The key question is whether the buyer gets more than it pays for.  \nThat said, the empirical evidence shows that the market responds more favorably to cash deals than to stock \ndeals.23 \n"

So \npaying with cash indicates the buyer is confident that the deal will create value. A buyer that uses stock shares \nthe risk and reward. A buyer that is unsure whether it can capture the synergies that premium demands can \nhedge its position by issuing stock.\nThe relatively poor reception to stock deals is also consistent with the hypothesis that managers issue stock \nwhen they believe that their stock is overvalued. Issuing stock is dilutive for current shareholders and indicates \nthat management does not believe its stock is undervalued.24\nOf the deals we analyzed, 44 percent were financed with cash, 21 percent with stock, and 35 percent with a \ncombination of cash and stock. For the cash deals, the buyer\u2019s stock had positive abnormal returns 51 \npercent of the time with an average abnormal return of 0.7 percent 5 days after the deal was announced. For \nthe stock deals, the buyer\u2019s stock had negative abnormal returns 70 percent of the time with an average \nabnormal return of -3.9 percent 5 days after the deal was announced.

About 80 percent of \nbolt-on deals add value, but only 40 percent of those that combine \u201clogical complements add value.\u201d \nTransitional deals add value a modest majority of the time when they help consolidate a mature industry, but \nthey destroy value a modest majority of the time when they help consolidate an emerging industry. Finally, \ntransformational deals, where a company shifts its business emphasis altogether, rarely create value. Clark \nand Mills summarize the problem when they write that the \u201cCEO\u2019s imagined vision [is] inconsistent with market \nrealities.\u201d \nSummary\nHere are the main points the checklist helps you discern. EPS accretion or dilution provides little or no \nguidance for assessing value creation. The buyer creates value when the synergies it realizes by combining \nwith the seller exceed the premium for control that it pays to the seller. Companies are commonly overly \noptimistic about the synergies they can capture, and experience shows that cost synergies are more reliable \nthan revenue synergies. Low premiums tend to be good because there is a lower bar to clear to create value.\nHow the buyer pays for the deal can provide a signal to the market. Research shows that cash deals generally \nlead to positive excess returns for the buyer and that stock deals have negative excess returns. Finally, the \nmotivations to do deals fall into various categories. A high percentage of opportunistic deals create value and a \nlow percentage of transformational ones do. \n"

Assuming a tax rate of 19.7 percent, the after-tax annual synergies are $60.2 million. We then capitalize \nthat at the cost of capital of 6.4 percent to arrive at a value of $943 million.\nThe premium is $360 million, which is the bid amount minus the pre-bid stock price times the shares \noutstanding for Orbitz ($12 - $8.70 * 109 million). We can see quickly that the synergies exceed the premium.\nThe net present value of the deal for Expedia equals the present value of the synergies minus the premium. \nPlugging in the figures, we see that the value creation is $583 million ($943 million in synergies - $360 million \npremium). Since this is a cash deal, that value goes to Expedia shareholders. \nThe formula suggests that Expedia shares will rise 6.6 percent ($583 million/$8.9 billion) and that Orbitz \nshares will gain more than 35 percent to the $12 per share bid price. In reality, the shares of the selling \ncompany rarely increase the full amount that the model suggests because of the time to close the deal and \nsome regulatory risk. Arbitrageurs generally step in to assume those risks. \n\uf0feIs the buyer sending a signal by choosing to pay with stock or cash?\nThis is a cash deal, which is a signal that Expedia\u2019s management believes the acquisition will add value.\n\uf0feWhat strategic category does the deal fall into?\nLast, we look at the motivation for the deal.

Centene, a health insurer based in the Midwest, sought Health Net to strengthen \nits position on the West Coast. Centene offered Health Net shareholders 0.622 shares of Centene common stock \nand $28.25 in cash for a total consideration of $78.57, a premium of 21 percent. Centene\u2019s stock closed at \n$80.90 and Health Net traded at $65.06 the day before deal was disclosed. The deal was expected to be \naccretive to Centene\u2019s earnings per share.\n\uf0feHow material is the deal for the shareholders of the buying and selling companies?\nThe shareholder value at risk (SVAR) for Centene shareholders is 7.7 percent, which we calculate as the $1,040 \nmillion premium divided by Centene\u2019s market capitalization of $9.6 billion plus the $3.9 billion portion of the offer \nthat is in stock. (See exhibit 15.) This compares to an average SVAR of 5.5 percent for the deals in our sample. \nThe premium at risk for Health Net shareholders is 28.7 percent. Here\u2019s the way to think about it. If the merger \nrealizes no synergies, Centene\u2019s shares will decline 7.7 percent (the definition of SVAR). The stated bid is for \n$78.57, with $28.25 of that value in cash and $50.32 in stock (0.622 * $80.90), a premium of $13.50 versus \nHealth Net\u2019s closing price of $65.06. If Centene\u2019s stock were to decline 7.7 percent, the value of the stock portion \nof the bid would decline to $46.45 (0.622 * $80.90*(1-0.077). Since the cash portion remains the same, the bid \nwould now be worth $74.70, a premium of $9.64. So $3.86 of the $13.50 premium, or 28.7 percent, is at risk in \nthe case that no synergies are realized.  \nExhibit 15: Merger Details between Centene Corporation and Health Net, Inc. \nBuyer\nCentene\nSeller\nHealth Net\nShareholder Value at Risk (SVAR)\nPremium\n1,039\nBuyer's market capitalization\n9,620\nSeller's market capitalization\n5,005\nSVAR\n7.7%\nPremium at Risk\n28.7%\nValue Creation\nPremium\n1,039\nAfter-tax annual synergies\n86\nCost of capital\n7.4%\nCapitalized value of synergies\n1,004\nSynergies - Premium\n-36\nBuyer anticipated change\n-0.3%\nSeller anticipated change\n20.5%\nEPS impact\nAccretive\nSource: Company data, FactSet, and Credit Suisse.\nNote: Figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.\n"

Assuming a tax rate of 42.9 percent, the after-tax annual synergies are $85.7 \nmillion. We then capitalize that at the cost of capital of 7.4 percent to reach a value of $1,155 million. Since the \nsynergies will not be realized until two years after the deal closes, we discount that value back at the cost of capital \nto arrive at a synergies number of $1,005 million ($1,155 million/1.0742). \nThe premium is $1,040 million, which is the bid amount minus the pre-bid stock price times the shares \noutstanding for Health Net ($78.57 - $65.06 * 77 million). We can see that the premium exceeds the \nsynergies.\nThe net present value of the deal for Centene equals the present value of the synergies minus the premium. \nPlugging in the figures, we see value destruction of $35 million ($1,005 million in synergies - $1,040 million \npremium). Since this is a cash and stock deal, Centene shareholders suffer and Health Net shareholders are \nnot expected to receive the full value pledged. \nThe formula suggests that Centene shares will fall a modest 0.3 percent and that Health Net shares will rise \nabout 20 percent.

Assume a buyer has a market capitalization of $2,000 and a seller has a pre-deal \nmarket capitalization of $800. Say that the buyer bids $1,000 (a $200 premium, or 25 percent) in cash but \nthat the true synergy is $400. The value of the buyer would rise to $2,200 as the synergy exceeds the \npremium by $200. Now assume the same starting point but that the buyer is using stock for the deal. The \nbuyer will end up with two-thirds percent of the combined entity, and two-thirds of the $200 in additional value \nwill flow to the buyer and one-third will go to the seller.\n12 Richard Roll, \u201cThe Hubris Hypothesis of Corporate Takeovers,\u201d Journal of Business, Vol. 59, No. 2, Part 1, \nApril 1986, 197-216 and Richard H.

Mauboussin, Expectations Investing (Boston, MA: Harvard Business \nSchool Press, 2001), 157.\n15 The other way to think of it is that the beginning value of both companies is $2,800 ($2,000 for the buyer \nand $800 for the seller). The buyer bids $1,000 but there are no synergies. So the value remains $2,800. \nSince the buyer owns two-thirds of the remaining firm ($2,000/$2,000 + $1,000), its value is now \n$1,866.66 ($2,800 * 2/3), down 6.7 percent. The seller\u2019s value is $933.33 ($2,800 * 1/3).   \n16 Angus Hodgson and Phil Dunne, \u201cM&A Deal Evaluation: Challenging Metrics Myths,\u201d A.T.
