Note that a properly calculated cost includes the opportunity cost of capital.  \n \nTo understand the significance of keystone companies, you have to think through the equation\u2019s terms: \n \n\u2022 \nWillingness to pay. Imagine someone hands you a new book you want. Clearly, that is good. Now \nimagine that person withdraws money from your bank account, starting with small sums. The amount of \nmoney that makes you indifferent between the book and the cash defines willingness to pay. \n \n\u2022 \nOpportunity cost. Now assume a firm takes resources away from its supplier. Opportunity cost is the \ncash amount that makes the supplier perceive the new situation (cash) as equivalent to the old situation \n(resources).  \n \nOf course, if you buy something for less than your willingness to pay, you capture a consumer surplus. \nLikewise, a supplier that sells a good or service for more than its opportunity cost recognizes a surplus. An \neconomic ecosystem\u2019s ability to spread added value and surplus to its various constituents is an important \nindicator of its health and sustainability. Exhibit 1 shows the value added chain. \n \nExhibit 1: Sources of Value Added \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopportunity\ncost\ncost\nprice\nwillingness-to-pay\nsupplier\u2019s share\nfirm\u2019s share\nbuyer\u2019s share\nTotal Value Created\nopportunity\ncost\ncost\nprice\nwillingness-to-pay\nsupplier\u2019s share\nfirm\u2019s share\nbuyer\u2019s share\nTotal Value Created\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n \nTraditional strategy analysis, including Porter\u2019s five forces (buyer power, supplier power, substitution threat, new \nentry threat, and rivalry), tends to dwell on suppliers, buyers, and competitors. 9 An ecological approach \nemphasizes another constituent, which Brandenburger and co-author Barry Nalebuff call a complementor. 10 A \ncomplementor provides a product that makes the product of another company more valuable. The classic \nexample is the relationship between microprocessors (Intel) and software (Microsoft). Better microprocessors \nmake software more valuable, and better software makes microprocessors more valuable.   \n \nWhy does a keystone advantage approach to strategy make sense?  \n \n\u2022 \nIt builds and extends work on networks. While networks are certainly not new, they are forming more \nfrequently and faster than ever before. An ecosystem approach can help investors understand the \nnetwork\u2019s robustness and prospects for economic value creation. 11 \n \n\u2022 \nIt builds and extends work on customer economics.

      "text": " \n \n \nValue Sharing versus Value Extraction \n \nIansiti and Levien distinguish between keystone companies and what they call dominators. In their words, a \nkeystone \u201cacts to improve the overall health of the ecosystem and, in doing so, benefits the sustained \nperformance of the firm. It does this by creating and sharing value with its network by leveraging its central hub \nposition in that network while generally occupying only a small part of that network.\u201d 13   The keystone company \nfosters a symbiotic relationship with the other companies in the network, allowing for mutual financial success.   \n \nIn contrast, dominators try to extract as much value from the network as possible. The authors define two types \nof dominators, a classic dominator and a hub landlord. A classic dominator \u201cacts to integrate vertically or \nhorizontally to directly control and own a large proportion of a network,\u201d \n \ncapturing most of the value created by \nthe network and \u201cleaving little opportunity for the emergence of a meaningful ecosystem.\u201d  The classic \ndominator creates and captures the value. They offer Apple as an example. \n \nThe second dominator type, the hub landlord, \u201ceschews control of the network and instead pursues control of \nvalue extraction alone.\u201d 14 Hub landlords try to extract the value the network creates. According to Iansiti and \nLevien, Enron acted as a hub landlord.  \n \nTwo other facets of healthy business ecologies are worth noting. First, by encouraging diversity and spreading \nresources, a keystone-based ecology tends to be more robust. Specifically, these ecosystems rapidly adapt to \nchange and can successfully continue even if some nodes are eliminated. This robustness is a crucial \ncomponent to the keystone\u2019s sustainable competitive advantage and the main message from the Toyota story. \n \nSecond, healthy ecosystems can benefit from the wisdom of crowds. 15 Since the keystone company provides \nstandards and resources for the network nodes but doesn\u2019t try to control them, business opportunities can \npercolate from the nodes. An impressive recent example is eBay Motors. Ebay management hadn\u2019t considered \nautos as a likely category, but they noticed gross merchandise sales of $750 million in 1998. In the spring of \n2000 the company launched eBay Motors, a business on track to generate $13 billion in gross merchandise \nsales in 2005. Says Bill Cobb, eBay\u2019s president of North America, about the eBay community, \u201cManaging is the \nwrong word; we enable, we listen, we respond.\u201d 16   \n \nThe Keystone Strategy \n \nIansiti and Levien simplify the keystone strategy into two core parts: value creation and value sharing.  \n \nValue creation. One way to distinguish a keystone company is to determine whether or not it\u2019s developing a \nviable platform for the ecosystem. 17 We define platform as a set of tools, provided either at a low cost or for \nfree, that allows other ecosystem members to solve problems. A successful platform requires a high degree of \nmodularity. A module is a self-contained building block that works with other building blocks to make a whole \nsystem. For example, the microprocessor, operating system, and hard drive are all modules in a personal \ncomputer (PC). \n \nHistorically, vertically integrated companies emerge at an industry\u2019s start because no module standard exists. \nThink of IBM\u2019s PC business in the early days: it designed the box and made the chips, the software, and drives. \nNecessity, not choice, dictated this process, as the modules were not yet established.  \n \nToday, however, more modules exist. Examples include Internet protocols, software, and communications. \nThese building blocks allow young companies to build valuable ecosystems by dividing the work among various \ngroups. This allows companies to take advantage of modularity\u2019s value from the very beginning, a crucial step \nin fostering innovation. 18 \n \nConsider that eBay, Google, and Amazon.com all have active programs that provide application programming \ninterfaces (APIs) for developers. An API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software \napplications. These APIs simplify interconnection, help address business needs, and\u2014perhaps most \nsignificantly\u2014unleash developer creativity. According to a Google software engineer, \u201cThere are a lot of things \nPage 4  \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

      "text": " \n \n \nGoogle hasn\u2019t thought of that people could do with their ad campaigns. One of the goals is to enable advertisers \nand third parties to create tools for their own purposes.\u201d 19  \n \nPlatforms also establish and maintain rules or standards that allow ecosystem participants to operate with trust. \nThe feedback systems on Amazon.com and eBay illustrate this point. But keystone companies don\u2019t overreach. \nAs eBay\u2019s CEO Meg Whitman says, \u201cWe make a small number of rules and get the heck out of the way, \nbecause the entrepreneurial talents of our users will solve a lot of problems.\u201d 20 \n \nA firmly established platform provides a huge competitive advantage, because the switching cost of the \necosystem\u2019s nodes rises sharply as the platform becomes established. Given a reasonable level of value \nsharing, ecosystem members have little incentive to leave. Investors who attempt to evaluate keystone \ncompanies based on a facet of their business\u2014say, Google\u2019s search capabilities or Amazon.com\u2019s prices\u2014\nmiss the much larger point: you can only understand competitive advantage at the ecosystem level.    \n \nValue sharing. Keystone companies don\u2019t try to extract value from the ecosystem. Rather, they try to capture a \nportion of the value they help the whole ecosystem create. Using the Brandenburger and Stuart framework, we \ncan analyze value sharing from a few different perspectives. \n \nSellers (including, but not limited to, suppliers) want to attain a price above their opportunity cost. Keystones \ncan help in two ways. First, by creating a liquid market keystones help sellers find the buyers likely to place the \nhighest value on their goods or services. Auctions represent a clear-cut example of this point. \n \nSecond, keystones often facilitate an information-for-price tradeoff. For instance, most suppliers acknowledge \nthat Wal-Mart drives a tough bargain on price. But in return, Wal-Mart provides the supplier with an \nextraordinary amount of useful information\u2014information the supplier can use to reduce its opportunity cost \nthrough better inventory management or facility utilization. By trading information for a lower price, keystone \ncompanies allow for value sharing in what looks superficially like an inequitable arrangement. This tradeoff has \nbeen important for Dell as well.  \n \nSimilarly, buyers seek to make purchases below their willingness to pay. For most product markets, innovation \nleads to a maturation point where price bumps into willingness to pay. 21 Willingness to pay, however, can rise \nwhen a keystone company enjoys network effects. \n \nA network effect exists when the value of a good or service increases as more people use that good or service. \nCommunication businesses are a good example. Telecommunications startup Skype allows subscribers to \nmake free phone calls, through their PC, to other Skype subscribers. As the number of Skype members grows, \nthe value of the service to current and prospective users increases.  \n \nSo as long as network effects exist\u2014and until the network gets saturated\u2014willingness to pay rises. Provided \nprices don\u2019t increase, the difference between willingness to pay and price is consumer surplus. So network-\ncentric keystone businesses can create value for buyers by growing value faster than price.  \n \nFinally, just as liquidity creates value for sellers (by identifying willing buyers) it creates value for buyers (by \nidentifying willing sellers). Liquid networks help reduce search costs for buyers and sellers. \n \nWe now turn to a brief analysis of three keystone companies: eBay, Google, and Amazon.com. These \ncompanies are all young (eBay and Amazon.com, the seniors, have just celebrated their tenth birthdays), global \n(35-45% of sales are international), and focus on building long-term value.  \n \nPage 5  \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

      "text": " \n \n \nEBay, Inc. \n \nWith about 150 million registered users, over 60 million active users, and in excess of 430 million listings around \nthe world, eBay neatly fits the keystone definition.  \n \nDespite significant success in its short corporate history\u2014including a $55 billion market capitalization\u2014eBay \nremains a remarkably small part of the ecosystem it supports. Estimates suggest that over 700,000 Americans \nmake all or part of their living trading on eBay (making it the second largest private \u201cemployer\u201d in the U.S. \nbehind only Wal-Mart), and analysts anticipate the gross merchandise value through eBay\u2019s site to exceed $40 \nbillion in 2005. In contrast, eBay had 8,100 employees at year-end 2004 and analysts expect 2005 revenues to \napproach $4.5 billion.    \n \nValue creation. The online market eBay created\u2014leveraging network effects\u2014is the first obvious way it adds \nvalue to its ecosystem. Since its early days eBay\u2019s network benefited from positive feedback; now the company \nhas dominant market shares in most countries in which it competes.   \n \nEbay took some steps early in its history to encourage positive feedback. First off, the company reduced \nbarriers to trial by making the site easy to use. It also provided the tools necessary for so-called power users. \nFor example, the company\u2019s 7,000-plus strong developer program has been very successful, allowing sellers to \nscale their businesses effectively.  \n \nA second, and crucial, source of value creation comes from eBay\u2019s feedback system. At the outset, eBay \nrecognized the eBay network would rely on trust. The feedback system allows buyers and sellers to rate one \nanother, and offers eBay an effective way to weed out dishonest users. \n \nPayPal, the on-line payments company eBay acquired in 2002, provides another major part of eBay\u2019s value \ncreation. At 72 million, PayPal now has more accounts than American Express, and about 75% of all \ntransactions on the U.S. site runs through PayPal. This business helps stem fraud in the ecosystem and \nenhances buyer and seller trust.    \n \nValue sharing. The network effects from eBay\u2019s ecosystem create an opportunity for a significant source of \nvalue sharing: consumer and seller surplus. By removing search costs and limiting transaction costs for sellers \nand buyers, the eBay network naturally reduces opportunity cost and enhances willingness to pay. Yet the real \nvalue comes from the platform\u2019s ability to match buyers and sellers in an unprecedented way.  \n \nWhile historically trade occurred locally with limited information, eBay enables national (and in some cases \ninternational) exchange with much greater transparency. As a result, sellers find better buyers (hence capturing \nsurplus) and buyers find better sellers (also capturing a surplus). And eBay\u2019s fees, as the broker, are 7-11% of \nthe gross merchandise value. The higher take includes transactions on PayPal.  \n \nThe eBay ecosystem has also spawned complementary businesses, including a group of so-called eBay drop-\noff stores\u2014companies that auction products on behalf of sellers. The list of drop-off store chains, including \nisoldit, Quik Drop, Auction Drop, New Markets, and Snappy Auctions, continues to expand. These \ncomplementary businesses are growing rapidly: isoldit claims to be the number one seller on eBay, with 100 \nstores and another 500-plus under contract. 22 All this comes with eBay\u2019s blessing. Ebay executive Jeff Jordan \nsays, \"We encourage this kind of growth\u2014anything that makes eBay more vibrant, easier to use or more fun is \na good thing.\" 23 \n     \nSummary. EBay may be the best example of a keystone company today. A very large and motivated ecosystem \nsurrounds the company, and eBay has been careful to recognize its role as a facilitator.  \nPage 6  \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

The company \nremains a leader in search market share, and has over 150,000 advertisers. \n \nValue creation. If you ask investors who they think Google\u2019s customers are they often answer, \u201cthe people who \nuse Google to search.\u201d  Search users, as consumers, are important but they don\u2019t pay Google anything. The \nadvertisers are the primary source of Google\u2019s revenues.  \n \nThe first important value creation source for Google is the positive feedback between the quality and quantity of \nsearch and the site\u2019s value to advertisers. More users of Google search leads to more value for advertisers. The \nadvertising revenue allows Google to improve search (as well as other capabilities), which attracts more users, \nand so on. This positive feedback has been central to Google\u2019s success, and the advertising revenues offer the \ncompany ample resources to extend its scope. \n \nGoogle\u2019s AdWords program makes it easy for advertisers to bid on keywords, manage their accounts, and pull \nreports as they desire. The company provides automated tools that help advertisers create their own ads, and \nthe total sign-up cost to become an AdWords advertiser is roughly $5.    \n \nGoogle also has a team dedicated to weeding out individuals trying to cheat the Google system by manipulating \ntheir relevance ranking through a process called click fraud. (Click fraud is a technique to increase the \nadvertising cost for competitors.) \n \nValue sharing. Remarkably, notwithstanding its multi-billion dollar revenue base, Google for the most part does \nnot set prices for its services. The company auctions off keywords, letting the advertisers themselves determine \nthe price of a particular keyword. \n \nAs we saw with eBay, an auction format provides consumer surplus if an advertiser can purchase a keyword for \nless than its willingness to pay. Further, evidence suggests that the return on investment for Internet advertising \nremains substantially in excess of traditional advertising mediums. 24   \n \nGoogle\u2019s AdSense program provides direct evidence of significant value sharing. In this program, Google \nNetwork members allow Google to set up advertising on their websites. Google allows the network member to \nkeep approximately 80 percent of the advertising revenues the member site generates. In 2004, Google paid \nover $1.2 billion to Google Network members. Google records gross AdSense revenue and treats AdSense \npayouts as traffic acquisition costs. These costs were 39 percent of revenue in 2004.  \n  \nSummary. Google focuses on creating value first and monetizing for the benefit of shareholders later. The still-\nstrong positive feedback loop between users and advertisers provides a substantial source of advantage, and \nthat the company doesn\u2019t set prices for its core business suggests the opportunity for consumer surplus. Finally, \nthe billions in AdSense payouts create significant switching costs for current and prospective competitors.   \nPage 7  \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

These features are at the core of sustainable competitive advantage.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpecial thanks to Mark Niemann for valuable input to this report.   \nPage 9  \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

The sea otter, for example, \nis a keystone in the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests offer food and shelter for many species of fish and \nshellfish. Otters reduce damaging wave action and eat sea urchins. Remove the otters, and the urchins feed on \nthe kelp, hence undermining the fish and shellfish living there.
