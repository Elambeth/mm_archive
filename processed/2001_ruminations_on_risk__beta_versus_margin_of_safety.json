      "text": "Ruminations on Risk\n3 August 2001\n2\nExecutive Summary\nThe concept of risk plays a central role in the investment process. Yet risk is an elusive\nconcept\uf8e7difficult to define, quantify and integrate.\nIn this report, we consider two senses of the term risk. The first is what is mainstream in\nfinance circles: you can measure risk by seeing how much a stock bounces around\nversus \u201cthe market.\u201d You can quantify this measure of risk through variance. The higher\nthe variance\uf8e7the larger the swings in relative price\uf8e7the riskier the stock.\nThe second sense is the \u201cmargin of safety\u201d, or a discount to expected value. The idea\nhere is that for every stock there is an intrinsic value, and that the deeper the discount\nthe stock price is to intrinsic value, the lower the risk.\nWe start this report by noting Warren Buffett\u2019s attack on the first risk definition. (We\nsuggest that he believes in, and acts according to, the second definition.) Unfortunately,\nBuffett attacks an idea that does not follow from finance theory. Without defending the\ntraditional theory, we note that Buffett\u2019s comments better reflect the second risk\ndefinition.\nThe conclusions from the report are as follows:\n\u2022 Volatility remains a reasonable measure of risk for the short-term. Long-term investors\nare better off considering the concept of margin of safety. There is evidence that\nsuggests that volatility understates risk for up to four years, but overstates risk for\nholding periods beyond four years.\n\u2022  Margin of safety can be restated as a discount to expected value. Expected value is a\nfunction of the weighted probability of potential outcomes. Judgments on both\noutcomes and probabilities are tricky, but essential to the investment process.\n\u2022 Investors should base the magnitude of their investments on the size of the margin of\nsafety. For companies with variable outcomes, the consensus can be the most likely\noutcome and the stock may still be attractive or unattractive. Companies with narrow\noutcomes require a non-consensus point of view for a buy or sell.\n"

      "text": "Ruminations on Risk\n3 August 2001\n3\nIntroduction\n\u201cFinance departments teach that volatility equals risk. Now they want to measure risk.\nAnd they don't know any other way\uf8e7they don't know how to do it, basically. So they say\nthat volatility measures risk.\nI've often used the example of the Washington Post stock when we first bought it: In\n1973, it had gone down almost 50%\uf8e7from a valuation of the whole company of close to\nsay $180 or $175 million down to maybe $80 million or $90 million. And because it\nhappened very fast, the beta of the stock had actually increased. A professor would\nhave told you that the stock of the company was more risky if you bought it for $80\nmillion than if you bought it for $170 million\uf8e7which is something that I\u2019ve thought about\never since they told me that 25 years ago. And I still haven\u2019t figured it out.\u201d\nWarren Buffett\nOutstanding Investor Digest (August 8, 1997)1\nWe love Warren Buffett. Anyone who\u2019s ever read our research or heard us talk knows it\nto be true. But there is something that\u2019s been bugging us for a long time, and we have to\nget it off our chests.\nBuffett got this one wrong.\nOften, when Buffett needs a lead-in to slam finance theory, he tells the above-quoted\nstory as prima facie evidence of his case. In early 1970s, Washington Post stock got\nwalloped, the beta went up (suggesting the stock was more risky) while any right-\nminded investor should see that the stock was actually less risky (because the price\ndropped more than the value).\nBuffett\u2019s argument has two problems. The first is that the beta didn\u2019t go up: we have the\nempirical data to back that one. The second is that in saying the stock is less risky,\nBuffett assumed that the price to value gap had widened\uf8e7the stock\u2019s \u201cmargin of safety\u201d\ngrew. But value could be logically distinct from price only if Buffett believed something\ndifferent than what the market believed. Buffett\u2019s judgment proved to be correct, but that\nis not necessarily a statement about the shortcomings of finance theory.\nRest assured, Buffett faithful, this report will have a happy ending. Indeed, we believe all\ninvestors can learn a great deal about an appropriate investment philosophy by studying\nand practicing Buffett\u2019s stock selection approach. But before we get to the good stuff,\nwe have to address the issue of beta.\nWe are not enthusiastic defenders of the finance theory faith. In fact, we have argued\nthat a new framework, based on complex adaptive systems, will supercede modern\nfinance theory.2 But it\u2019s one thing to attack finance theory based on what it predicts, it\u2019s\nanother game altogether to challenge the theory based on claims it doesn\u2019t make. And\nnowhere does finance theory say that the beta on Washington Post\u2019s stock must rise\njust because the stock declines. Such a statement confuses beta, a measure of a\nstock\u2019s covariance vis-a-vis the market (often using the S&P 500 as a proxy), with\nalpha, a measure of risk-adjusted excess returns.\nExhibit 1 presents Washington Post\u2019s beta and alpha graphically. Beta is the slope of\nthe fitted line through the plotted monthly rates of return for Washington Post versus the\n"

Beta doesn\u2019t measure an asset\u2019s returns versus another asset, it just\nmeasures whether or not the asset\u2019s price bounces more or less than another asset\u2019s.\nAlpha, the intercept, does represent a rate of price change. So just because Washington\nPost\u2019s alpha was negative (i.e., its returns were below those of the market) during 1973\ndidn\u2019t mean that its beta had to rise.\nExhibit 1: Washington Post Beta and Alpha (1973)\nSource: Barra Beta book, CSFB analysis.\nExhibit 2 shows the actual historical beta for WPO\u2019s stock. Notwithstanding the stock\u2019s\ncorrection, the beta actually dropped from roughly 2.4 in early 1973 to 2.3 by the end of\nthe year, by our calculation. Barra\u2019s beta figures show a similar decline. The negative\nalpha, of course, reflects the stock\u2019s poor relative performance.\nExhibit 2: Washington Post Historical Beta (1973)\nS&P\nStock\nBeta\nAlpha\nBarra Beta\nJan-73\n116.03\n$31.00\n2.28\n-0.2%\n3.16\nFeb-73\n111.68\n$26.75\n2.40\n-0.5%\n3.19\nMar-73\n111.52\n$25.75\n2.41\n-0.7%\n3.20\nApr-73\n106.97\n$23.50\n2.37\n-0.6%\n2.98\nMay-73\n104.95\n$23.25\n2.33\n-0.4%\n2.91\nJun-73\n104.26\n$19.50\n2.39\n-1.0%\n3.06\nJul-73\n108.22\n$21.00\n2.38\n-1.0%\n3.09\nAug-73\n104.25\n$20.13\n2.29\n-0.8%\n2.92\nSep-73\n108.43\n$23.13\n2.38\n-0.6%\n2.99\nOct-73\n108.29\n$23.88\n2.38\n-0.4%\n2.95\nNov-73\n95.96\n$18.00\n2.29\n-0.3%\n2.64\nDec-73\n97.55\n$17.00\n2.25\n-0.6%\n2.61\nSource: Barra Beta Book, CSFB analysis.\nBeta = 2.25\n{\nAlpha = -0.6%\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\nBeta = 2.25\n{\nAlpha = -0.6%\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n"

      "text": "Ruminations on Risk\n3 August 2001\n5\nThe classic definition of risk is the possibility of suffering harm or loss. So an asset that\nhas a wide distribution of potential returns presents a greater probability of \u201csuffering\nharm\u201d (or sizable gains) than an asset with a narrow distribution of probabilities. We\nagree with Peter Bernstein, who notes that \u201cvolatility, or variance, has an intuitive appeal\nas a proxy for risk.\u201d He adds, \u201cIf you were asked to rank the riskiness of shares of the\nBrazil Fund, shares of General Electric, a U.S. Treasury bond due in thirty years, and a\nU.S. treasury bill due in ninety days, the ranking would be obvious. So would the relative\nvolatility of the securities.\u201d3\nThe critical catch is volatility\u2019s temporal dimension. More directly, there is some\nevidence that variance understates risk over the first four years of a holding period, but\noverstates risk over four years or more.4 This evidence implies that long-term holders\nassume less risk than short-term holders. We might even make the statement that the\nlong term investor welcomes volatility if it helps present investment opportunities.\nWe like to think about risk on at least two levels. Over the short term, volatility is a pretty\nreasonable measure of risk.5 Indeed, volatility plays an overwhelming important role in\nthe design and valuation of derivatives\uf8e7most notably options.\nBut for investors with a long-term horizon, we think the best way to maximize the\nrisk/reward tradeoff is to buy stocks that offer a margin of safety. We think this is what\nBuffett refers to when he thinks about risk. A margin of safety\uf8e7a concept attributable to\nBen Graham\uf8e7exists when an investor can purchase a stock well below its intrinsic\nvalue.6 Buffett defines intrinsic value in no uncertain terms: \u201cit is the discounted value of\nthe cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.\u201d7\n"

      "text": "Ruminations on Risk\n3 August 2001\n6\nMargin of Safety\nWe believe the best and most practical way to restate the margin of safety concept is to\nthink about discounts to expected value. The combination of probabilities and potential\noutcomes determine expected value. Says Buffett, \u201cTake the probability of loss times\nthe amount of possible loss from the probability of gain times the amount of possible\ngain. That is what we\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s imperfect, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d8\nTake the simple example of a coin toss that pays $3 for heads and $1 for tails. What\u2019s\nthe expected value? You calculate it as (50% x $3) + (50% x $1) = $2. Now for\ninvesting, both the probabilities and the potential outcomes are much more difficult to\nestimate, but the idea is the same. Let\u2019s take a closer look at both probability and\npotential outcomes.\nWe can specify two types of probabilities: objective (or frequency) and subjective.9\nObjective, or frequency, probabilities arise when there are specified outcomes. Coin\ntosses are a good example. In these cases, the probability is based on the law of\naverages as it assumes that the event is repeated countless times. While we still can\u2019t\nmake definitive statements about any specific outcome, the frequency of outcomes will\nreflect the probability of each outcome over time.\nThe circumstances are totally different for events that only happen once\uf8e7a valid\nassumption for stock investing. Here, we must rely on subjective probabilities.\nSubjective probabilities describe an investor\u2019s \u201cdegree of belief\u201d about an outcome.10\nThese probabilities are rarely static, and generally change as evidence comes along.\nBayes\u2019s Theorem is a means to continually update conditional probabilities based on\nnew information. Bayesian analysis is a valuable means to weigh multiple possible\noutcomes when only one outcome will occur.11\nAs Robert Hagstrom notes, the textbooks on Bayesian analysis suggest that if you\nbelieve that your assumptions are reasonable, it is perfectly acceptable to make your\nsubjective probability of a particular event equal to a frequency probability.12 Thinking\nabout the investing world probabilistically is critical to the margin of safety concept.\nWe now turn to potential outcomes. Analysts often use target prices to represent their\nbest guess of the most likely outcome. However, intelligent investors explicitly\nacknowledge that they must consider a range of potential outcomes. How does an\ninvestor go about constructing this range?\nThe expectations investing approach offers a specific process to calculate potential\noutcomes based on various revisions in expectations.13 In short, the process involves\nconsidering whether changes in sales, operating costs, or investments have the\ngreatest impact on shareholder value. (This step explicitly considers interactivity\uf8e7for\nexample, how higher sales sometimes lifts operating profit margins as well.)  Once you\ndevelop reasonable ranges for the most important trigger, you can specify ranges of the\nshareholder values that result.\nFor example, let\u2019s say that you determine that sales growth is the most important trigger\nfor a particular company. You can then consider all of the micro-economic factors that\nsales set off (e.g., operating leverage, economies of scale) and estimate the resulting\n"

This allows for an estimate of stock price\noutcomes.\nWe generally recommend considering at least three outcomes: a high value, a low\nvalue, and a consensus value. The consensus value represents the expectations that\nthe stock price implies. These outcomes, when combined with associated probabilities,\nprovide a solid basis for estimating expected value.\nConsider a simple illustration. Assume that analysis of a stock\u2019s potential outcomes\nyields a high value of $82 and a low value of $12. The stock currently trades at $50.\nNext, allow for subjective probabilities of the outcomes as follows: 20 percent for the low\nscenario, 30 percent for the high scenario and 50 percent for the consensus. The\nexpected value for this stock is $52, as exhibit 3 shows.\nExhibit 3: Expected Value Calculation\nWeighted\nStock Price\nProbability\nValue\n$12\n20%\n$2.40\n50\n50%\n25.00\n        \n82\n30%\n24.60\n        \n$52.00\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nTwo important observations follow from the use of expected value analysis as a\nmeasure of margin of safety. The first is that the greater the discount to expected\nvalue\uf8e7the larger the margin of safety\uf8e7the more you should invest. The Kelly\nOptimization Model provides some guidance on the appropriate relative size of\ninvestments. The following formula expresses the model:\n2p - 1 = x\nWhere 2 times the probability of winning (p) minus 1 equals the percentage of your total\nassets that you should invest (x).14 The Kelly Optimization Model has limitations and,\nneedless to say, the stock market is more complex than many risk-reward scenarios.\nBut the idea is critical: Bet large when you believe the probability of success is high, and\ndon\u2019t play if the probability of success is negligible. Buffett has reinforced this idea of the\nyears by suggesting that investors only be allowed to make 20 investments decisions in\ntheir lives.\nThe second important observation deals with value variability. Specifically, if a company\nhas a wide range of stock price outcomes (high variability), the stock may be attractive\nor unattractive even if the consensus is the most probable outcome. This is because a\nlower-than-consensus yet sufficiently high probability placed on, say, a high outcome\nwell in excess of the current price creates a large price-to-expected value gap.\nAlternatively, if a company has low value variability, you must bet against the consensus\nto achieve a sufficient margin of safety. This is so because when the consensus is most\nlikely, the price-to-expected value gaps is too narrow to generate a sufficient margin of\nsafety.\n"

Any investor interested in purchasing a structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the\nproduct and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase.\nSome investments discussed in the research may have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that investment is realised.\nThose losses may equal your original investment.  In the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in such circumstances you may be required to pay more\nmoney to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and in consequence initial capital paid to make the investment may be used as part of that income yield.\nSome investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such\nan investment is exposed. The investments and services contained or referred to in this report may not be suitable for you, it is recommended you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt\nabout those investments or investment services.
