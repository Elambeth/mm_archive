A company generates \na positive economic profit when it earns a return on investment in \nexcess of the opportunity cost of capital. \nCompetition is a feature of capitalism. A company earning a \nhandsome economic profit will attract competitors that seek to \nwrest that profit away either by selling similar goods or services at \na lower cost or by providing attractive substitute offerings. \nProductive investment is the engine of capitalism. Companies \nspend on tangible or intangible assets with the expectation that \nfuture cash flows, discounted to the present, will be worth more \nthan the outlay. Successful investment creates wealth because \none dollar of investment is worth more than one dollar in value. \nCreditors and equity holders provide the capital to invest. Creditors \nhave a senior claim on cash flows and hence have lower risk and \nexpected return than equity holders. Equity holders have a residual \nclaim on cash flows, so they have higher risk and potential reward. \nOnce a company is up and running, the primary source of \ninvestment capital tends to be cash that is generated internally. \nSince 1980, internal financing has supplied more than 90 percent \nof the capital for investment in the U.S.1 This can come from \nretained earnings or other stakeholders, including suppliers.2 \nCapital allocation is arguably a management team\u2019s most \nimportant task. The goal of capital allocation is to put resources to \ntheir best and highest use so as to create long-term value per share \nfor ongoing shareholders. You can think of capital allocation in two \nparts. One is investing in the business, which includes familiar \nforms such as capital expenditures, intangible assets, and mergers \nand acquisitions. \nThe other is transacting with securities that have prices that are \nbased on corporate value, including buying and selling the debt and \nequity of a company. This introduces the potential for a wealth \ntransfer, where one stakeholder benefits at the expense of another. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n5711670 Exp. 5/31/2024 \n2 \n \nWealth Transfers \nA wealth transfer occurs when a company buys or sells a mispriced security.3 We focus on equity. The intuition \nis straightforward and amounts to little more than \u201cbuy low and sell high.\u201d The essential issue is whether \nexecutives can discern between price and value. In theory, they should have information about the prospects \nfor their companies that investors lack. This can provide an opportunity to initiate a wealth transfer. \nThe empirical research on the topic comes to a few conclusions. First, companies can indeed time the sale and \npurchase of equity so as to benefit ongoing shareholders.4 Second, wealth transfers tend to be larger for sales \nof overpriced equity than they are for purchases of undervalued equity.5 Third, institutional investors are \ngenerally more discerning than individual investors when transacting with a company.6 \nRichard Sloan and Haifeng You, professors of accounting, find that companies buying and selling equity transfer \none to two percent of the pre-deal market value from the transacting shareholders to the ongoing shareholders, \nmeasured five years after the event.7 \nAn important implication of these transfers is that a stock\u2019s dollar-weighted average return can be less than its \ntime-weighted return. Total shareholder returns are generally reported using time-weighted returns. This concept \nis related to the observation that mutual fund investors generally earn lower returns than the funds in which they \ninvest because of poor timing. For example, the dollar-weighted returns were 117 basis points lower than time-\nweighted returns for U.S. equity mutual funds for the 10 years ended December 31, 2020.8 \nIlia Dichev, a professor of accounting, provides an example to make the point clear (we modify his numbers \nmodestly).9 A company starts with 1,000 shares of a stock that trades at $100 a share. The stock then doubles \nto $200 and the company sells 1,000 shares. Finally, the stock returns to $100. \nIt is obvious that the initial shareholders are flat on their investment and the new shareholders are down 50 \npercent. In fact, in this scenario the dollar-weighted return is -26.8 percent, measured using internal rate of return \n(IRR). But the time-weighted return is zero because the stock ended where it began. \nThis analysis is based on price change, which is what investors ultimately care about. Wealth transfers rely on \na stock being mispriced, which presumes that price differs from intrinsic value. When we introduce value, we \ncan observe that selling overvalued stock and buying back undervalued stock add to firm value per share. \nSymmetrically, buying back overvalued stock and selling undervalued stock subtract from firm value per share \n(see exhibit 1). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Say the intrinsic value of the firm at the outset is $100,000 and that the price \naccurately reflects that value ($100 per share x 1,000 shares outstanding = $100,000). The stock rises to $200, \nand the firm sells 1,000 shares. The new value of the firm is $300,000 ($300,000 = $100,000 + $200,000 in \nproceeds) and the value per share rises from $100 to $150 per share ($150 = $300,000 \u00f7 2,000 shares \noutstanding). The wealth transfer is from the buying shareholders to ongoing holders, which becomes clear if \nthe stock price declines to $150 and matches its new value per share. Buying shareholders lose $50 per share \nwhile the ongoing holders gain $50. Note that the price regresses to a higher value. \nWe can start with the same intrinsic value and price and see what happens if the company buys back \nundervalued stock. Now assume the stock drops from $100 to $50 and the company repurchases 500 shares. \nThe value of the firm decreases to $75,000 ($75,000 = $100,000 - $25,000 repurchase cost) but the value per \nshare increases to $150 per share ($150 = $75,000 \u00f7 500 shares outstanding). The wealth transfer is from the \nselling shareholders to the ongoing holders if price and the new value align. Selling shareholders lose $50 per \nshare and ongoing holders gain $50. \nA company that sells overvalued stock increases the value per share for the ongoing holders. But it should be \nnoted that those holders would be better off selling alongside the firm. A company that buys undervalued stock \nalso augments value per share. But in this case, ongoing shareholders improve their situation by doing nothing. \nThis analysis is relevant for stocks that gain attention through social media and appeal primarily to retail \ninvestors. These are colloquially called \u201cmeme stocks\u201d because the individuals who buy them commonly react \nto ideas developed and spread on the Internet.10 Consider that the net daily purchases of U.S equities and \nexchange-traded funds by individuals at the height of popularity for meme stocks was roughly 10 times the level \nof purchases in 2019 before major online brokerage firms moved to zero commissions.11 \nThe large price changes of these stocks suggest mispricing. These stock price spikes present an opportunity for \na wealth transfer via corporate action. \nStock Price\nUndervalued\nOvervalued\nCompany\nBuys\nSells\n\u2022 Buyers gain\n\u2022 Ongoing holders lose\n\u2022 Buyers lose\n\u2022 Ongoing holders gain\n\u2022 Sellers lose\n\u2022 Ongoing holders gain\n\u2022 Sellers gain\n\u2022 Ongoing holders lose\n"

But in reality, determining intrinsic value is \nmuch more difficult. To simplify our analysis, we use the average target price of the sell-side analysts who cover \na stock as a proxy for intrinsic value. As is generally known, target prices are not very accurate and tend to be \noptimistic. This means that realized prices tend to fall short of the target.12 The math of wealth transfers still \nworks, but the magnitude of the effect is muted if the target price is higher than the intrinsic value. \nThe recent case of GameStop, a retailer of video games and consumer electronics, is an example of equity \nissuance executed at a price that substantially exceeded value as implied by the target price of analysts. On \nApril 9, 2021, GameStop had 65.3 million shares outstanding and the stock closed at $158.36. Between June 9 \nand June 22, GameStop sold 5 million shares at an average price of $225.20 per share. During the time of the \nsale, the average target price was $65.48.  \nThe intrinsic value increased from $65.48 to $76.84 per share, a gain of more than 17 percent, as a result of the \nissuance.13 On August 11, 2021, the stock closed at $158.78. Measuring stock price returns from roughly two \nmonths before the issuance to two months after reveals an IRR of -1.4 percent but a time-weighted gain of 0.3 \npercent. \nAnother noteworthy aspect of the transaction is that the company added more than $1.1 billion to its balance \nsheet. This introduces a capital allocation opportunity and risk. The capital creates additional wealth if it is \ndeployed into the operations and earns a return in excess of the cost of capital. But an investment below the \ncost of capital is a drag on the value of the operations.14 \nAMC Entertainment Holdings, a movie theater chain, is another company with equity that qualified as a meme \nstock. The company sold stock in a similar fashion. Indeed, its actions had an even larger impact on intrinsic \nvalue than was the case for GameStop. AMC chose to deploy some of its cash into a gold mine company, \nHycroft Mining, hence diversifying away from its core operations.15 \nConclusion \nCompanies can affect wealth in a couple of ways. First, they can make investments in their operations that earn \nin excess of the cost of capital. This activity benefits capital providers. But sustaining returns above the cost of \ncapital is challenging because of competition and the inevitable maturation of various markets for goods or \nservices. \nCompanies can also transfer wealth by buying or selling mispriced stock. The evidence shows that in the \naggregate companies do sell high and buy low, which means that transacting shareholders fare worse than \nongoing holders. \nAstute investors focus on a management\u2019s ability to allocate capital and tend to focus on investments in the \nbusiness. This is appropriate. But investors should also be aware of the impact of management actions with \nregard to their own stock. The essential guide is the gap between price and value. \nFinally, many investors count on mispriced stocks regressing toward their value per share over time as a means \nto generate excess returns. Wealth transfers show that actions by management can change the value per share \nwithout any change in the underlying fundamentals of the operations. \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 7-9 \n \n"

See https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20220310/z1.pdf, page 18. \n2 This can be seen through analysis of the cash conversion cycle, a measure of how long it takes to convert \ninvestments in inventory into cash. Companies with a negative cash conversion cycle receive cash for the goods \nor services they produce before they have to pay their suppliers. This timing difference is a source of cash as \nlong as the business grows. \n3 Wealth transfers can happen by other means as well. One of the best examples is captured in the principal-\nagent problem. In this case, the principal is the shareholder and the agent is the manager of the business. The \nproblem arises when the agent enriches his or herself, for instance through unnecessary perquisites, that \ntransfer wealth from the principal to the agent. Other potential but more ambiguous cases include leveraged \nrecapitalizations, where companies borrow money to repurchase stock, and spinoffs. \n4 Amy Dittmar and Laura Casares Field, \u201cCan Managers Time the Market?

More recent work parses asset growth into \ninvestment and non-investment components. Rapid asset growth as the result of investment growth does not \npredict poor returns. By contrast, rapid asset growth as the result of equity issuance but without investment \ndoes.
