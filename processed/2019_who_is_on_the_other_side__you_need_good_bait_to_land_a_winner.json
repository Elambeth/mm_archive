Some \nsources of valuable information remain \nexpensive and the cost to capture an \nopportunity can be material. \n \nBut perhaps the biggest source of market \ninefficiency remains the human being. As \ngroups, we repeatedly veer to extremes in our  \n \n \n \noptimism or pessimism, leaving mispriced \nsecurities in our wake. And then there are \ninstitutions that play by rules imposed by \nregulation, contract, or internal policy. The \nresult can be actions that make sense for the \ninstitution but create inefficiency in the \nmarket. In short, many inefficiencies remain. \n \nIn this report, Michael describes a taxonomy \nof inefficiencies, supported by a rich vein of \nacademic research. The goal is to have a \nclear idea of why efficiency is constrained \nand why we believe we have an opportunity \nto generate an attractive return after an \nadjustment for risk. As always, we would be \npleased to discuss specific examples of how \nwe apply these principles. \n \nAndrew Feldstein \n \nChief Investment Officer \nFebruary 12, 2019 \n"

Capital markets that \nfunction well are an essential contributor to the \neffective allocation of corporate resources.1 \nInvestors seek inefficiencies to generate excess \nreturns, or returns that are higher than expected \nafter adjusting for risk. Understanding efficiency \nrequires us to examine lots of elements, including \nthe market for information, the interplay between \ncapital market participants, and inherent frictions. \nOur goal is to create a taxonomy of the sources \nof inefficiency to provide active investors with a \nrobust way to think about delivering excess \nreturns. \nEfficiency Defined. The term \u201cefficiency\u201d comes \nfrom physics and measures the relationship \nbetween the input of energy and the output of \nuseful work. For instance, your body can roughly \ntranslate every 100 calories you eat into about \n20-25 calories of useful work. It turns out that level \nof efficiency is similar to a common combustion \nengine. Neither your body nor a machine can \ntranslate 100 percent of its energy into work \nbecause of friction.2  \nMarkets are not machines, but the idea of \nefficiency still applies. In the case of markets, the \ninput is information and the output is an asset \nprice that reflects fair value. Eugene Fama, a \nprofessor of finance at the University of Chicago \nBooth School of Business and a recipient of the \n2013 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \nfor his work on market efficiency, sums it up this \nway: \u201cA market in which prices always \u2018fully \nreflect\u2019 available information is called \n\u2018efficient.\u2019\u201d3 Just as a perfectly efficient machine \ndoes not exist, neither does a perfectly efficient \nmarket.  \nBefore turning to market inefficiency, we explore \nsome important ideas that sometimes get short \nshrift from academics and practitioners.4 To start, \nthere are two related but distinct markets to \nconsider. One is the market for information about \nassets and the other is the market for assets.  \n \n \n \n \nThe Market for Information and the Market for \nAssets. In 1980, a pair of finance professors, \nSanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz, wrote a \npaper called \u201cOn the Impossibility of \nInformationally Efficient Markets.\u201d5 They argue \nthat markets cannot be perfectly efficient \nbecause there is a cost to gathering information \nand reflecting it in asset prices and therefore \nthere must be a proportionate benefit in the form \nof excess returns. Because collecting information \nis costly, active investors need exploitable \nmispricings to provide a sufficient incentive to \nparticipate. Lasse Pedersen, a professor of \nfinance, says that markets must be \u201cefficiently \ninefficient.\u201d6 In this market, investors seek to \u201cbuy\u201d \ninformation and \u201csell\u201d profit.         \nThe market for assets concerns the price at which \ninvestors buy and sell fractional stakes in various \nassets. Some investors trade based on \ninformation, others trade on data or drivers not \nrelevant to value, and still others free ride. For \ninstance, investors in portfolios that mirror indexes \nor follow specific rules rely on active managers for \nproper price discovery and liquidity.   \nThe market\u2019s ability to translate information into \nprice is limited by costs. These are commonly \ncalled \u201carbitrage costs\u201d and include costs \nassociated with identifying and verifying \nmispricing, implementing and executing trades, \nand financing and funding securities.7 These costs \ncreate frictions that are commonly understated in \nacademic research. That said, many of these \ncosts have come down over time, which has \ncontributed to greater efficiency in many \nmarkets. For example, Regulation Fair Disclosure, \nimplemented in 2000, seeks to quash selective \ncorporate disclosure. In addition, trading costs \nhave dropped precipitously in recent decades as \nthe result of deregulation and advances in \ntechnology. \nExhibit 1 summarizes the relationship between the \nmarkets for information and asset prices. Having \na view that is different than what is priced in, as \nwell as the ability to profit from that view, are \nboth essential to generating excess returns.     \n \n \n \n"

Robert Shiller, a professor of \neconomics at Yale University who shared the \nNobel Prize with Fama in 2013, created a model \nbased on the concept of a noise trader.8 These \ninvestors trade \u201con noise as if it were information\u201d \nand \u201cfrom an objective point of view they would \nbe better off not trading.\u201d9 The model suggests \nthat fundamental value and the cost of arbitrage \njointly determine an asset price.  \nWhen arbitrage costs are low, markets tend to be \nefficient in the classic sense. When arbitrage costs \nare high, price and value can meaningfully differ \nfrom one another. Value is defined as the present \nvalue of cash flow. An influential paper on the \ntopic defined \u201can efficient market as one in \nwhich price is within a factor of 2 of value, i.e., \nthe price is more than half of value and less than \ntwice value.\u201d10 \nThe main point is that it is reasonable to think \nabout efficiency, a state where price equals \nvalue, as falling along a continuum from very \ninefficient to very efficient. Indeed, in an update \nto his classic paper on the topic, Fama proposes \nthat a more \u201csensible\u201d version of an efficient \nmarket is one in which prices incorporate \ninformation to the point \u201cwhere the marginal \nbenefits of acting on information (the profits to be \nmade) do not exceed the marginal costs.\u201d11     \nThis suggests a useful distinction between \u201cprices \nare right\u201d and \u201cno free lunch.\u201d12 Prices are right \nmeans that price is an unbiased estimate of \nvalue. No free lunch says that there is no \ninvestment strategy that reliably generates excess \nreturns. A common argument for market \nefficiency is that very few investment managers \nconsistently deliver excess returns. If prices are \nright, it stands to reason that there is no free \nlunch. \nBut the opposite is not true. There can be no free \nlunch even when prices are wrong if the cost and \nrisk of correcting a mispricing are sufficiently high. \nIdentifying and exploiting these pockets of \ninefficiency should be the main focus of active \nmanagers.      \nThe joint hypothesis problem also hampers the \nability to come up with a definitive answer to the \nquestion of market efficiency.13 The first \nhypothesis is that an asset-pricing model predicts \nasset price returns. Academics and practitioners \ncommonly use the capital asset pricing model \n(CAPM), which describes the relationship \nbetween systematic risk and expected returns. \nThe second hypothesis is that the market is \nefficient.  \nThe basic problem is that you can consider an \nasset return anomalous only if you have an \naccurate asset-pricing model. As a \nconsequence, what you deem to be an \nanomalous return may be the result of an \ninaccurate asset-pricing model, a market \ninefficiency, or both. Bear this in mind any time \nyou hear or see a discussion of market anomalies. \nEvery time that you buy or sell a security and \nanticipate excess returns you should ask, \u201cWho is \non the other side?\u201d Ideally, you should \nunderstand your counterparty\u2019s motivation and \nask why you have an edge. We also know that \ninstitutions, generally absent in asset pricing \nmodels, are very important in practice (see \nAppendix A: Agency Theory in Asset \nManagement). Ed Thorp, a mathematician and \n"

First, a large percentage of factors that \nare correlated with excess returns are the result of \nstatistical bias. When there are a lot of data and \na lot of relationships, some factors will correlate \nwith good past returns but will have no predictive \nvalue.

This is especially true when \nthe cost to do so is not prohibitive. This is the \nnature of markets. Exploitable opportunities do \nnot last long if investors can identify and capture \nthem at a reasonable cost.   \nWe now turn to a taxonomy of structural \ninefficiencies based on behavioral, analytical, \ninformational, or technical (BAIT) sources. Most of \nthe inefficiencies we will describe are the result of \nmultiple sources, but we will attempt to place \nopportunities in the category that makes the \nmost sense. To be an active investor, you must \nbelieve in inefficiency and efficiency. You need \ninefficiency to get opportunities, and efficiency \nfor those opportunities to turn into returns.\n"

      "text": " \nBL U EM O UN TA IN INV ES TM E NT RESE A RC H  \n6 \nBehavioral Inefficiencies\nA behavioral inefficiency exists when an investor, \nor more likely a group of investors, behave in a \nway that causes price and value to diverge. \nBehavioral inefficiencies may be at once the \nmost persistent source of opportunity and the \nmost difficult to capture. The persistence stems \nfrom human nature, which does not change \nrapidly. Ben Graham, the father of value \ninvesting, said it this way:17   \nThough business conditions may change, \ncorporations and securities may change and \nfinancial institutions and regulations may \nchange, human nature remains essentially \nthe same. Thus the important and difficult \npart of sound investment, which hinges upon \nthe investor\u2019s own temperament and \nattitude, is not much affected by the passing \nyears. \nThe difficulty stems from the fact that humans are \nsocial beings and investing is inherently a social \nactivity. Graham used the parable of Mr. Market \nto make the point: You own a small stake in a \nprivate company that costs you $1,000. One of \nyour partners is an obliging fellow named Mr. \nMarket who tells you, every day, what he thinks \nyour stake is worth and, further, offers a price at \nwhich he\u2019s willing to buy you out or offer you an \nadditional interest. Mr. Market represents the \ncollective action of investors.  \nIn his telling of the story, Warren Buffett, chairman \nand chief executive officer (CEO) of Berkshire \nHathaway and Graham\u2019s most successful \nstudent, goes on to say that Mr. Market has \n\u201cincurable emotional problems.\u201d He writes, \n\u201cSometimes he is euphoric and sees only \nfavorable outcomes and hence names a very \nhigh buy-sell price. Other times he is depressed \nand sees only negative outcomes and provides a \nvery low buy-sell price. Mr. Market is there to serve \nyou, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his \nwisdom, that you will find useful.\u201d18 The point is \nthat while markets generally offer sensible prices, \nthere have been and will continue to be bouts of \nextreme optimism and pessimism.  \nThis leads to why behavioral inefficiencies are so \nhard to exploit. The very driver of behavioral \ninefficiency, correlated beliefs, makes it difficult \nto take advantage of the opportunity. Most of us \nhave a powerful desire to be part of the crowd \nand an aversion to being separate from the \ncrowd. The psychological pull to conform is \nstrongest at the extremes of fear and greed.19 \nThere are at least a couple of good reasons to \nconsider the behavioral influence on asset prices. \nFirst, only a fraction of asset price moves can be \ndirectly linked to changes in fundamentals, such \nas revisions in cash flow or interest rate \nexpectations. This has been established by studies \nof the biggest moves in the stock market since \nthe 1940s that looked to the media for a \nfundamental explanation after the fact. In many \ncases, there is no clear fundamental driver of \nvalue. Exhibit 2 shows a summary of the top 10 \nmoves in the Center for Research in Security \nPrices (CRSP) value-weighted index of stocks and \nthe media\u2019s explanation for the change.   \nA recent study concluded, \u201cOnly a minority of the \n50 largest moves in the last 25 years can be tied \nto fundamental economic information that could \nhave had a pronounced impact on cash-flow \nforecasts or discount rates.\u201d20 These studies make \nit clear that asset price changes have \nfundamental and behavioral sources.  \n"

For instance, capuchin monkeys \nexhibit loss aversion, the tendency to suffer more \nfrom losses than to enjoy gains of a similar size.22    \nBeware of Behavioral Finance. Behavioral \neconomics shows how psychological factors can \nlead individuals or organizations to make \ndecisions that deviate from economic theory. It \nalso shows how the use of heuristics, or rules of \nthumb, can lead to biases that affect choices. \nThis body of research is extremely valuable to \nanyone who seeks to make thoughtful and \nunbiased decisions.  \nBut it is important to recognize that individual \nerrors, however widespread, are rarely relevant in \ndetermining market efficiency. The interaction of \ninvestors with little information or rationality can \nyield prices with surprising efficiency. The essential \nconditions include the presence of investors with \nsufficiently heterogeneous views and decision \nrules and having an effective way to aggregate \nthe information. The researchers who wrote one \nof the seminal papers on the topic summarize \ntheir finding as follows:23 \nAllocative efficiency of a double auction \nmarket derives largely from its structure, \nindependent of traders\u2019 motivation, \nintelligence, or learning. Adam Smith\u2019s \ninvisible hand may be more powerful than \nsome may have thought; it can generate \naggregate rationality not only from individual \nrationality but also from individual irrationality. \nThe lesson is that you cannot extrapolate from \nindividuals, who fail to operate according to the \nrules of rationality, to markets. The reason is that \nindividual errors can cancel out, leading to \naccurate prices. You can be an overconfident \nbuyer and I can be an overconfident seller and \nthe net result is a correct price. The key is \nunderstanding when the wisdom of crowds flips \nto the madness of crowds. And the essential \ninsight is that it has to do with a violation of one or \nmore of the core conditions for a wise crowd.  \nCritical to understanding behavioral sources of \ninefficiency is identifying when the beliefs of \n"

Some strong believers in \nefficient markets claim that behavioral \nexplanations are a compilation of stories that \nresearchers craft to fit the facts.24 Nicholas \nBarberis, a professor of finance at the Yale School \nof Management, suggests that many of the key \nconcepts in behavioral finance are based on the \npsychology of belief formation and the \npsychology of decision making.25   \nOverextrapolation. Overextrapolation, the \nexcessive projection of recent experience, is one \nof the key ideas behind the psychology of belief \nformation. For example, financial economists \nhave shown that investor expectations for future \nstock returns in the next year are highly \ncorrelated with returns in the past year. Exhibit 3 \nshows the percentage of household equity and \nfixed income investments that are allocated to \nequities and subsequent five-year stock market \nreturns. Investors expect high returns after \nrealizing high returns and expect low returns after \nrealizing low returns.26 \nBecause stock prices are more volatile than \ncorporate earnings, valuations tend to be higher \nfollowing a period of strong price advances and \nlower subsequent to price declines. In contrast \nwith expectations as the result of \noverextrapolation, high valuations are associated \nwith low expected returns, and low valuations \nwith high expected returns. This relationship holds \nfor asset classes beyond stocks, including bonds, \nreal estate, and sovereign debt.27 \nAvoiding this type of overextrapolation demands \nthe ability to \u201cdisregard mob fears or enthusiasms \nand to focus on a few simple fundamentals.\u201d28 \nSeth Klarman, founder, chief executive officer, \nand portfolio manager of The Baupost Group, \ncaptured the concept beautifully when he said, \n\u201cValue investing is at its core the marriage of a \ncontrarian streak and a calculator.\u201d29 The \n\u201ccontrarian\u201d part demands an examination of \nthe other side of the popular view. The \n\u201ccalculator\u201d part ensures that valuation is \nsufficiently extreme to generate excess returns.    \nAcademics have developed a model of a \nfinancial bubble, a sharp rise in an asset price \nover a short period of time leading to a lofty \nvaluation, based on extrapolation. The model \nreflects the fact that almost all bubbles are \npreceded by good fundamental news and have \nabnormally high trading volume driven by \n\u201cwavering extrapolators.\u201d30 The main challenge \nto investing following sharp price increases is they \nare not reliably associated with unusually low \nprospective returns. However, these run-ups are \nassociated with a greater probability of a crash.31  \nExhibit 3: Household Equity Share and Future Five-Year Stock Returns, 1953-2018 \n \nSource: Bloomberg and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, \nBalance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations and Households\u2019 Financial Assets and Liabilities. \nNote: Stock returns are total shareholder returns for the S&P 500; Through the third quarter of 2018. \n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n40%\n45%\n50%\n55%\n60%\n65%\n70%\n75%\n80%\n85%\n90%\n1953\n1958\n1963\n1968\n1973\n1978\n1983\n1988\n1993\n1998\n2003\n2008\n2013\n2018\nFuture 5-Year Stock Returns, Annualized \n(Axis Inverted)\nHousehold Equity Share (Percent)\nHousehold Equity Share\nFuture 5-Year Stock Returns\nHigh expectations\nLow future returns\nLow expectations\nHigh future returns\n"

For example, a stock that \nhas done well in the last half year will do well in \nthe upcoming six months before reversing. More \nstrictly, a strategy to take advantage of the \nmomentum effect is more rigorous than the \nsimple extrapolation by return chasers.32  \nPerformance chasing is another manifestation of \noverextrapolation.33 Both retail and institutional \ninvestors have a tendency to buy funds that have \ndone well and sell those that have performed \npoorly. For example, a study of pension plan \nsponsors found that in the two years preceding a \ndecision to fire or hire, the investors they fired had \nunderperformed, and the investors they hired \nhad outperformed, their benchmarks.  \nThe decision to fire or hire is evidence of \noverextrapolation.

The \ndata reveal that the fired managers generate \nhigher returns than the hired managers in the \nfollowing two years.34 Economists doing related \nwork conclude, \u201cClearly, plan sponsors could \nhave saved hundreds of billions of dollars in assets \nif they had simply stayed the course.\u201d35 \nOverconfidence is another notable aspect of the \npsychology of belief formation.

For example, growth stocks, \ndefined as the top quintile of stocks based on \nprice-to-book ratios, generally have substantially \nhigher turnover than value stocks, the bottom \nquintile of stocks based on price-to-book ratios.38  \nExhibit 4: Plan Sponsors Buy High and Sell Low \n \nSource: Amit Goyal and Sunil Wahal, \u201cThe Selection and \nTermination of Investment Management Firms by Plan \nSponsors,\u201d Journal of Finance, Vol. 63, No. 4, August \n2008, 1805-1847. \nNote: Performance reflects 2-year cumulative excess \nreturns relative to an appropriate benchmark. \nSentiment.

To be more formal, \nconsider the diversity prediction theorem, which \nsays that given a crowd of predictive models, the \ncollective error equals the average individual \nerror minus the prediction diversity.41 You can \nthink of \u201ccollective error\u201d as the wisdom of the \ncrowd, \u201caverage individual error\u201d as smarts, and \n\u201cprediction diversity\u201d as the difference among \npredictive models. In markets, price veers from \nvalue when investors come to believe the same \nthing, or act as if they do. In other words, when \ninvestors lose diversity markets lose efficiency.   \nOne way to animate the concept is to examine \nan agent-based model. These models create \nagents in silico, endow them with decision rules \nand objectives, allow them to interact with one \nanother, and provide them with the ability to \nlearn and adapt.  \nBlake LeBaron, a professor of economics at \nBrandeis University and an expert in agent-based \nmodeling, built such a model.42 He included 1,000 \nagents with well-defined objectives for portfolio \nallocations, a risk-free asset, an asset that pays a \ndividend at a rate calibrated to the empirical \nrecord in the last half century, and 250 active \ndecision rules. The agents made or lost money as \nthey traded and he eliminated those with the \nlowest levels of wealth. He also evolved the \ndecision rules by removing those the agents did \nnot use and replacing them with new ones. The \nbeauty of LeBaron\u2019s model is we can observe the \ninteraction between diversity and asset prices. \nLeBaron\u2019s model replicates many of the empirical \nfeatures of markets, including clustered volatility, \nvariable trading volumes, and fat tails. For the \npurpose of this discussion, the crucial observation \nis that sharp rises in the asset price are preceded \nby a reduction in the number of rules the traders \nused (see exhibit 5). LeBaron describes it this \nway:43 \nDuring the run-up to a crash, population \ndiversity falls. Agents begin to use very similar \ntrading strategies as their common good \nperformance begins to self-reinforce. This \nmakes the population very brittle, in that a \nsmall reduction in the demand for shares \ncould have a strong destabilizing impact on \nthe market. The economic mechanism here is \nclear. Traders have a hard time finding \nanyone to sell to in a falling market since \neveryone else is following very similar \nstrategies. In the Walrasian setup used here, \nthis forces the price to drop by a large \nmagnitude to clear the market. The \npopulation homogeneity translates into a \nreduction in market liquidity.  \nBecause the traders were using the same rules, \ndiversity dropped and they pushed the asset \nprice into bubble territory. At the same time, the \nmarket\u2019s fragility rose.   \n \n"

The first is that as \nthe agents lose diversity by imitating one another, \nthe initial impact is that they get richer. This is why \nbetting against a bubble is so hard. Positive \nfeedback pushes price away from value and \ncreates lots of paper gains along the way. Being \nwrong in the short term, even if you are correct in \nthe long term, introduces career risk where poor \nresults put a portfolio manager\u2019s job in \njeopardy.44  \nSecond, the market\u2019s reaction to a reduction in \ndiversity is non-linear. As diversity falls, the \nmarket\u2019s fragility rises. But the higher asset price \nobscures the underlying vulnerability. At a critical \npoint, however, an incremental reduction in \ndiversity leads to a large drop in the asset price. \nCrowded trades work until they don\u2019t.45  \nCrowding not only induces mispricing, it also \ncreates a lack of liquidity.46 When the buyers are \nusing the same rule and the population of sellers \nusing different rules has nothing left to sell, the \nmodel reveals that the price has to drop sharply \nto clear the market. The non-linear relationship \nbetween diversity and price makes the sharp \ndecline appear shocking in retrospect.         \nHow Beliefs Spread. The final lesson is how investor \nbeliefs come to be correlated. There is a large \nbody of research on this topic, but at the core \nyou need to understand a model of how ideas or \ninformation propagate across a network.47 \nEpidemiologists use a model to describe the \nspread of disease that is analogous to the spread \nof beliefs, including fads and fashions.48 The \nmodel considers the degree of contagiousness, \nthe degree of interaction, and the degree of \nrecovery. The model\u2019s output is intuitive. The \nhigher the contagiousness and interaction, the \nhigher the likelihood that a disease or belief will \nspread.   \nInvestors attempting to assess belief propagation \nin markets need to bear in mind a few points. \nFirst, it is inherently difficult to anticipate which \nideas or products will be popular.49 For example, \nfilm and music studios struggle to create hits.  \nSecond, humans are inherently social and most \nhave a desire to conform to the crowd\u2019s beliefs. \n"

For a \nfad or fashion, conforming means you won\u2019t \nstand out in a way that makes you \nuncomfortable.  \nIn markets, diversity breakdowns often include \nboth new investors participating and seasoned \ninvestors sitting it out. These new investors are \ncommonly individuals.51 When individuals buy an \ninvestment or investment theme, the probability \nof a diversity breakdown rises. The dot-com boom \nand Bitcoin are two good illustrations. Likewise, \nwhen seasoned investors stop betting against the \ninvestment or investment theme, they contribute \nto the lack of diversity. With no countervailing \nopinion voting in the market, decision rules \nconverge and diversity suffers.     \nBut asset markets have an additional element: If \nyou join the crowd early enough in the belief that \nan asset price is going up and buy accordingly, \nyour wealth initially increases. This reinforces the \nnotion that you made a good decision. The asset \nprice influences you and makes you richer, which \nfeels good. Until it doesn\u2019t.  \nFinally, investors feel the pressure to conform. The \nCFA Institute surveyed more than 700 investors \nand found that \u201cbeing influenced by peers to \nfollow trends\u201d was the behavioral bias that \naffected decision making the most.52 It is difficult \nto beat your peers if you are doing the exact \nsame thing that they are doing. \nHow does an investor effectively take advantage \nof behavioral inefficiencies?  \n\uf0b7 Be mindful of sentiment and \noverextrapolation. Using Graham\u2019s \nmetaphor, Mr. Market is generally \nreasonable and price is roughly equivalent \nto value. But Mr. Market is prone to \nextremes. When sentiment is uniformly \npositive or negative, be prepared to visit the \nopposite side of the argument. But being a \ncontrarian for the sake of being a contrarian \nis a bad idea, and the consensus can be \ncorrect.  \n \n \n \n\uf0b7 Rely on valuation. When markets go to \nextremes, valuations tend to follow. The \ncrucial question is, \u201cWhat expectations for \nfuture financial results are implied by the \ncurrent price?\u201d53 When sentiment shifts are \nexcessive, expectations become unduly \nhigh or low. Do the math. Figure out what \nyou have to believe to justify the prevailing \nprice, and compare that to plausible \nscenarios. \n\uf0b7 Lean on facts. When an asset price is under \nthe spell of extreme sentiment, make an \neffort to explicitly separate facts from \nopinions. A fact is information that is \npresumed to have objective reality and \ntherefore can be disproved. An opinion is a \nbelief that is more than an impression but \ndoes not meet the standard of positive \nknowledge. As a result, an opinion may be \ndifficult to disprove. Both facts and opinions \nare useful for investors, but facts should rule \nthe day.54 \n\uf0b7 Timing. Behavioral inefficiencies can have \ndifferent time cycles. For example, \nmomentum tends to reverse over a \nrelatively short period of time of less than a \nyear. Large bubbles can take years to burst. \nA number of prominent value investors, \nincluding Julian Robertson at Tiger \nManagement, closed their funds following \nthe dot-com boom in the late 1990s. The \nmain point is that taking advantage of \nbehavioral inefficiencies can take more \ntime than investment managers perceive \nthey can afford. \nBenjamin Graham offered what might be the \nbest advice. He said, \u201cHave the courage of your \nknowledge and experience. If you have formed \na conclusion from the facts and if you know your \njudgment is sound, act on it\u2014even though others \nmay hesitate or differ.

Financial and non-\nfinancial information include items such as \nanalyst earnings estimates and revisions, \nmanagement forecasts, earnings management, \nsentiment, and insider trades.56 An analytical \nedge versus other investors can arise from having \nmore analytical skill, weighing information \ndifferently, updating views more effectively, \noperating on a different time scale, or \nanticipating a change in the market\u2019s narrative.  \nAnalytical Skill. The game of tennis provides an \nanalogy for understanding analytical skill.57 \nImagine a match between a tennis professional \nand a weekend warrior. They use the same \nequipment, play on the same court, and abide \nby the same rules. But the professional will have a \nbetter technique and strategy and will be prone \nto fewer errors. In the world of investing, \ninstitutions are the professionals and individuals \nare the weekend warriors.    \nInstitutional investors generally beat individual \ninvestors when they go head-to-head, which \nmeans that individuals can be a good source of \nexcess returns for institutions. A comprehensive \nsurvey of the behavior of individual investors \nnoted that \u201cthe evidence indicates that the \naverage individual investor underperforms the \nmarket\u2014both before and after fees.\u201d58 \nFor the market as a whole, excess positive and \nnegative returns must sum to zero before fees. \nThe magnitude of positive and negative returns is \nassociated with differential skill. A comprehensive \nstudy of all of the investors in Taiwan revealed \nthat institutions earned abnormal excess returns \nof 1.5 percentage points while individuals lost 3.8 \npercentage points (see exhibit 6).59 The \nindividuals suffered from a lack of skill and an \nexcess of confidence. \nInstitutions generally have better information and \nanalytical skills than individuals do. For example, \ninstitutions tend to buy stocks from individuals in \ncases when the stock underreacts to good news \nabout future cash flows, outperforming individuals \nby 1.4 percentage points per year in these \ncases.60 In addition, initial public offerings with \nhigh participation rates by retail investors \nunderperform those dominated by institutions.61 \nExhibit 6: When Institutions Compete with \nIndividuals, Institutions Tend to Win \n \nSource: Source: Brad M.

Another source of \nanalytical edge exists when one investor has the \nsame information as other investors but weighs \nthe information differently. One simple analogy is \nsizing in portfolio construction. We each construct \na portfolio using the exact same list of stocks. We \nhave the same information. Our returns over time \nwill be the result of how we weigh the positions. \nWhat distinguishes us is not what we have to work \nwith but how we use what we have. \nOur conviction in a particular hypothesis \ncombines two types of evidence. The first is the \nstrength, or extremeness, of the evidence, and \nthe second is the weight, or predictive validity. \nFor instance, say you have a hypothesis that a \ncoin is biased in favor of tails. The ratio of flips that \nland on tails to those that land on heads \nindicates strength, and the number of flips, or \nsample size, reflects the weight.62  \nThere are formal rules for how to combine \nstrength and weight correctly. But most people \ndo not follow the theory. In particular, the \nstrength of evidence tends to loom larger in \ndecisions than the weight of evidence.

Continuing \nwith the example of the coin toss, this would be \nthe case when tails shows up 7 times in the first 10 \nflips (which will happen 12 percent of the time \nwith a fair coin). The strength is high but the \nweight is low. This mechanism is consistent with \nthe overconfidence and overextrapolation \ndiscussed in the behavioral section. \nIn particular, you should be very alert to the risk of \noverreacting to outcomes based on small sample \nsizes and a related concept, recency bias, which \nis the result of placing too much weight on recent \nevents.63 Surveys of investors and executives \nconsistently show a strong inclination to \nincorrectly expect the near-term future to be \nsimilar to the recent past.  \nWhen strength is low and the weight is high, \npeople tend to be under-confident. In this case, \nthe signal is faint but meaningful because of the \nlarge sample size. It\u2019s one thing to have 7 tails out \nof 10 flips and another thing altogether to have \n5,100 or more tails out of 10,000 flips (which will \nhappen only about 2 percent of the time with a \nfair coin). The way to avoid this mistake is to \nconsider base rates, or the results of an \nappropriate reference class.64        \nBe a Good Bayesian. The next source of \nanalytical edge is updating your views better \nthan others. At issue is how well you integrate \nnew information with your prior beliefs. The proper \nway to do this is to use Bayes\u2019s Theorem. The \ntheorem tells you the probability that a theory or \nbelief is true conditional on some event \nhappening. But the truth is even people who \nknow the theorem rarely apply it formally. What\u2019s \nessential is to be open to new information and to \nbe willing to change your mind. \nThe primary reason that we fail to sufficiently \nupdate our beliefs in light of new information is \nthat we suffer from confirmation bias. The bias \nmanifests in a couple of ways. We tend to seek \ninformation that confirms our belief and dismiss or \ndiscount information that disconfirms it. Further, \nwe generally interpret ambiguous information in \na way that is consistent with our prior belief. Once \nwe believe something, the mistakes we make \noften serve to preserve our view.65 \nPhil Tetlock, a professor of psychology at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, raises some other \ncommon mistakes. One mistake is overreacting \nto information that superficially appears to \nexplain causality but in fact does not. You see this \nin the analysis of merger and acquisition (M&A) \ndeals. For example, equity analysts sometimes \nupgrade a stock following the announcement of \nan acquisition as the result of anticipated \nearnings accretion, only to see the stock drop. A \nchange in earnings is not the best way to capture \ncausality in M&A. \nOverreaction to new information can also be the \nresult of the contrast effect. The idea is that good \nnews is perceived as more impressive than it \nshould be if it is preceded by bad news, and less \nimpressive than it should be if it follows good \nnews. These are errors in perception that lead to \nmispricing, and a strategy to capture the contrast \neffect appears to generate excess returns.66 \nAnother mistake is for the decision maker to \nunderreact to information that he or she fails to \nrecognize as causal. Continuing with the theme \nof M&A, meaningful but underappreciated \ninformation includes a comparison of the present \nvalue of synergies with the premium pledged. This \nrequires some modest calculations but is \ndemonstrably more relevant than earnings \nchanges based on accounting figures. Decision \nmakers who are able to distinguish between what \ninformation matters and what doesn\u2019t have an \nanalytical edge. \nTime Arbitrage. As far back as the 1970s, Jack \nTreynor, an economist and luminary in the \ninvestment industry, discussed the idea that an \ninvestor can gain an edge by operating on a \ndifferent timescale than others.

Pursuit of \nthe second kind of idea . . . is, of course, the \nonly meaningful definition of \u201clong-term \ninvesting.\u201d67 \nTo explain why this opportunity exists, Treynor \nrefers to John Maynard Keynes, the renowned \neconomist, who adds two essential elements to \nthe case. Keynes suggests, \nThe energies and skill of the professional \ninvestor . . . are, in fact, largely concerned, \nnot with making superior long-term forecasts \nof the probable yield of an investment over \nits whole life, but with foreseeing changes in \nthe conventional basis of valuation a short \ntime ahead of the general public. They are \nconcerned, not with what an investment is \nreally worth to a man who buys it \u201cfor keeps\u201d, \nbut with what the market will value it at, \nunder the influence of mass psychology, \nthree months or a year hence. \nHe goes on to emphasize how challenging it is to \nbe a long-term investor: \nFinally it is the long-term investor, he who \nmost promotes the public interest, who will in \npractice come in for most criticism, wherever \ninvestment funds are managed by \ncommittees or boards or banks. For it is in the \nessence of his behaviour that he should be  \neccentric, unconventional and rash in the \neyes of average opinion. If he is successful, \nthat will only confirm the general belief in his \nrashness; and if in the short run he is \nunsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not \nreceive much mercy. Worldly wisdom \nteaches that it is better for reputation to fail \nconventionally than to succeed \nunconventionally.68 \nBoth Treynor and Keynes emphasize the \nimportance of time horizon and suggest that \noutsized returns are available to the long-term \ninvestor. But they make clear that long-term \ninvesting requires \u201creflection and judgment\u201d and \nthat those who practice it will \u201ccome in for most \ncriticism.\u201d This is a blend of analytical and \nbehavioral issues.     \nInvestors use the term \u201ctime arbitrage\u201d to reflect \ncases where the market reflects short-term noise \nas if it were long-term signal. Returning to the \nexample of the coin toss, an opportunity for time \narbitrage exists if the market prices a fair coin as if \nit is biased after 7 of the first 10 flips are tails.  \nThere are three elements to successfully taking \nadvantage of time arbitrage. The first is that the \ninvestor must be able to accurately separate \nsignal from noise. In the coin toss example, the \nsignal is an even split between tails and heads, \nand the noise is the appearance of a bias toward \ntails. The second is the signal must eventually \nreveal itself. That is, after lots of flips, the ratio of \ntails to heads settles very close to one-to-one (see \nexhibit 8). The third is you must have access to \ncapital that is sufficiently patient to allow the \nresults to materialize.\nExhibit 8: A Simple Model of Time Arbitrage \n \n \nSource: BlueMountain Capital Management.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nPercentage That Are Tails\nNumber of Trials\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1\n100\n10,000\nPercentage That Are Tails\nNumber of Trials (Log)\n"

Based on nearly a century of data, the \nprobability you will see a gain in your diversified \nU.S. stock portfolio is roughly 51 percent for a day, \n53 percent for a week, and 75 percent for a year. \nLook out a decade or more and the probability \nof a profit is very close to 100 percent.  \nBoth ideas are well established on their own, but \ntogether they address the issue of investor time \nhorizon in a new way. The more frequently an \ninvestor looks at his or her portfolio, the more likely \nhe or she is to observe losses and suffer from loss \naversion. As a result, an investor examining his or \nher portfolio all the time requires a higher return \nto compensate for suffering from losses than one \nwho looks at his or her portfolio infrequently and \nhence suffers less. A long-term investor is willing to \npay a higher price for the same asset than is a \nshort-term investor.71 Evidence from the field \nsuggests that professional investors are not \nimmune from myopic loss aversion.72 \nThe portfolio evaluation period consistent with the \nrealized equity risk premium from 1926 through \n1990 was about one year. Investors may not be \nable to select their degree of loss aversion, but \nthey can select how frequently they evaluate \ntheir portfolios. Using a simulation technique \ngrounded in realistic parameters, researchers at \nthe investment firm Renaissance Technologies \nfound that the evaluation period that worked \nbest was longer than three years. They summarize \ntheir analysis by noting that \u201cthe most profitable \ndegree of patience is very different from that \nfound in current industry practice.\u201d73 \nThe second idea related to opportunity and time \nhorizon is that we differ in our degrees of loss \naversion, and the degree we suffer changes as \nthe result of recent experience. You can gain an \nanalytical edge by making consistent decisions \nwith regard to the opportunity set. \nOne fascinating experiment showed how hard \nthat is to do.74 Researchers created a simple \ninvestment game and drew players from two \ngroups: patients with brain damage and ordinary \nsubjects. The patients with brain damage had \nnormal intelligence, and no harm was done to \nthe regions of their brains that handled logic and \ncognitive reasoning. The regions of the brain that \nwere harmed controlled emotions, including the \nusual ability to experience fear or anxiety. They \ndidn\u2019t suffer after they lost. \nThe researchers gave each participant $20, and \nthe game consisted of 20 rounds of coin tosses. \nFor each round, individuals could play or sit out. If \nthey played, they passed $1 to the experimenter \nwho flipped a fair coin and paid $2.50 for tails \nand nothing for heads. The subjects got to keep \ntheir dollar if they sat out the round. The objective \nwas to end up with as much money as possible. \nThe game is not hard to figure out. The expected \nvalue of handing $1 to the experimenter is $1.25, \nhigher than the value of keeping it. The ideal \nstrategy is to invest in every round. All of the \nparticipants appeared to grasp the basic math. \nBut the patients with brain damage ended up \nwith 13 percent more money, on average, than \nthe normal patients did. The difference was the \nsubjects with brain damage participated in 45 \npercent more rounds than did the players in the \ncontrol group. In particular, the brain-damaged \nsubjects played roughly 80 percent of the rounds \nafter having lost compared to the 40 percent \nplayed by ordinary participants (see exhibit 9). \nNearly all of the players participated in the early \nrounds. But an interesting pattern emerged. \nNormal players appeared to suffer from loss \naversion after they lost a round and sat out \nsubsequent rounds at a higher rate than the \npatients with brain damage who did not suffer \nfrom loss aversion. Loss aversion caused normal \nparticipants to forgo a positive expected value \nbet after having lost when a heads appeared on \na toss. Even though the financial proposition was \nconsistently attractive, the recent experience of \nthe normal participants colored their actions.75 \n"

Long-term investing \nallows a shareholder to amortize that cost over \nan extended holding period. As Cliff Asness, \nfounder, Managing Principal, and Chief \nInvestment Officer at AQR Capital Management, \nhas said, \u201cHaving, and sticking to, a true long \nterm perspective is the closest you can come to \npossessing an investing super power [sic].\u201d76 \nThe Power of Stories. The concluding possible \nsource of analytical edge is anticipating how the \nnarrative about a company will change, leading \nto a revision in the valuation the market accords \nthe stock. The change in a stock price over time \nreflects a change in expectations. Fundamental \nresults, including sales growth and profits, exert a \nlarge influence in shaping expectations. But the \nstories that investors tell, and believe, also play a \nmeaningful role in revisions of expectations.77  \nPsychologists have shown that \u201calternative \ndescriptions of the same event often produce \nsystematically different judgments.\u201d78 A debate \nbetween Aswath Damodaran, a professor of \nfinance at the Stern School of Business at New \nYork University and a recognized expert in \nvaluation, and Bill Gurley, a leading venture  \n \ncapitalist at Benchmark Capital, serves as a good \nexample. Both are believers in valuing businesses \nusing a discounted cash flow model. \nIn June 2014, Damodaran suggested a valuation \nfor Uber, an online transportation network, of $5.9 \nbillion. His analysis came on the heels of a round \nof fundraising that valued the company at $17 \nbillion. In July 2014, Gurley, whose firm was an \nearly investor, responded with a piece called \n\u201cHow to Miss By a Mile,\u201d suggesting that \nDamodaran considered a total addressable \nmarket that was too small.79 At the heart of their \ndisagreement was a description: the professor \nthought Uber was going after the global taxi and \ncar-service market and the venture capitalist \nassumed vastly more cases for using Uber, \nincluding replacing the need to own a car. \nAt the end of the day, the value of a company\u2019s \nstock is the cash it distributes to its shareholders \nover the company\u2019s life.

As Grossman and Stiglitz pointed out, \ngathering information relevant to value can be \nexpensive and investors who do so can \nreasonably expect to earn excess returns. But \nregulation has ensured that companies disclose \nand disseminate information uniformly, and \ntechnology makes it quick and cheap to do so. \nAs a consequence, the cost of gathering legal, \nnon-traditional information has escalated.  \nAn informational edge can take a few forms. The \nfirst is to legally acquire relevant information that \nothers don\u2019t have. Second, there is substantial \nevidence that attention is costly and that some \ninefficiencies arise from limited attention as a \nresult. Paying attention to the right information \ncan provide edge. Finally, there is research that \nshows that complexity slows the process of \ninformation diffusion, so anticipating the impact \nof information can confer edge.  \nFind Out First. The first and most obvious source of \ninformational edge is to know things relevant to \nvalue that others don\u2019t yet know. It is useful to \ndistinguish between data and information. Data \nis the plural of datum, which means \u201csomething \ngiven.\u201d Data need not be useful. Information \norganizes data in a way that is useful. Technically, \ninformation reduces uncertainty. Access to data \ndoes not confer an informational edge. An ability \nto translate data into information, or access to \ninformation directly, can be a source of edge. \nThis source of edge may be linked to size and \nscale. Bigger investment firms can amortize the \ncost of data and have the ability to turn it into \ninformation more cost effectively than smaller \nfirms can.  \nThere is no doubt that some investors generate \nexcess returns by acquiring information that other \ninvestors don\u2019t have. For example, some hedge \nfunds made lots of money by using the Freedom \nof Information Act to collect non-public \ninformation about pharmaceutical companies \nfrom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.83 You \ncan imagine a host of innovative, if costly, means \nto acquire useful information, including hiring top \nlaw firms to interpret legal issues, working with \nconsultants to grasp political dynamics, or \nengaging a firm that specializes in analyzing \nstorm damage to assess the potential costs. There \nhas been an explosion in data gathering, from \ncredit card receipts to satellite images counting \ncars in parking lots, which has created an arms \nrace in the investment community.  \nThe mosaic theory, which the legendary investor \nPhil Fisher called \u201cscuttlebutt,\u201d describes an \napproach that gathers public and non-public \ninformation from a variety of sources, including \nsuppliers, competitors, customers, and former \nemployees in an attempt to create an edge.84 \nThe value in the approach relies not on a single \npiece of information but rather on how various \npieces of information combine to form a view \nthat is different from that of the market. The \nsynthesis of information is more important than \nany one bit of information. \nConsistent with Grossman and Stiglitz, there is a \nhigh cost and benefit of information gathering. \nInvestors who can translate information into asset \nprices benefit by earning excess returns. Society \nbenefits by having asset prices that are more \nefficient.    \nRegulation has focused on making access to \ncorporate information uniform. Regulation Fair \nDisclosure (Reg FD) was implemented in October \n2000 in the United States. Reg FD prohibits \ncompanies \u201cfrom privately disclosing material \ninformation to select investors or securities \nmarkets professionals without simultaneously \ndisclosing the same information to the public.\u201d85 \nOn balance, the evidence shows the \nimplementation of Reg FD led to greater \ninformational efficiency and that some \ninvestment firms that had previously benefited \nfrom privileged disclosure lost an informational \nedge.86   \nThere is illuminating evidence of Reg FD\u2019s effect \non market efficiency. When enacted in 2000, \ncredit rating agencies were exempt from the \nregulation. That meant credit analysts had \naccess to confidential information unavailable to \nequity analysts. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation repealed that exemption. The research \nshows that the informational effect of bond rating \nupgrades and downgrades was greater after \nReg FD than before it, and that the effect faded \nafter the credit agencies lost access to that \nprivileged information in 2010.87     \n"

Generally \nspeaking, firms buy back stock when it is \nundervalued and issue stock when it is \novervalued, which benefits ongoing shareholders \nat the expense of the shareholders who sell or \nbuy. Companies are able to do this because \nexecutives have better information about the \ncompany\u2019s prospects than investors do. Speaking \nto the relevance of this information asymmetry \nand the potential for excess returns, the \neconomists who did this research suggest that \n\u201cthese wealth transfers can be predicted using a \nvariety of firm characteristics and that future \nwealth transfers are an important determinant of \ncurrent stock prices.\u201d88 \nPay Attention. On Sunday, May 3, 1998, the New \nYork Times published an article on the front page \nabout a potential breakthrough in cancer \ntreatment via an injection of drugs that halt the \nblood supply to tumors. The article mentioned \nEntreMed, a company that had the licensing \nrights to the technology.89 The next day, the stock \nskyrocketed from around $12 to more than $51 \nper share on volume 78 times the daily average. \nThe elevated stock price persisted through the \nrest of the year. \nWhat makes this story remarkable is that the \nscience magazine, Nature, and the New York \nTimes ran stories covering the substance of this \nresearch in late 1997.90 There was no new news. \nThis brings us to our second source of \ninformational edge: paying attention.91 There is \nsubstantial evidence that investors have limited \nattention and hence do not incorporate all \navailable information. This presents opportunity to \ninvestors who can assimilate relevant information. \nOne simple model is based on the fraction of \ninvestors who are inattentive. When that fraction \nis very low, markets tend to be informationally \nefficient. When that fraction is high, asset prices \nfail to reflect available information and an \nopportunity for a variant perception arises. \nResearch in psychology suggests that a few \nfactors determine the fraction of inattentive \ninvestors, including the salience of the \ninformation, the resources investors use to address \nthe information, and how easily investors can \nprocess the information. In general, investors \nhave a harder time paying attention the more \nstimuli they face that competes for that attention. \nInformation can get lost in the shuffle.   \nYou can think of the process of making \ninvestment decisions in two parts. The first relates \nto attention and the second relates to \npreferences. Researchers found that individual \ninvestors, in particular, are drawn to stocks that \ngrab attention. For example, stocks that host Jim \nCramer recommends on the television show Mad \nMoney enjoy large short-term gains.92 As a result, \ninvestment decisions can be more sensitive to the \nchoice of what investors pay attention to than to \ntheir preferences. This effect is much less \npronounced with institutional investors, who have \nmore time and can allocate their attention with \nmore rigor.93 \nTask Complexity. Task complexity is the final \nsource of informational edge. As Lee and So \nsummarize in their survey paper, \u201cSignal \ncomplexity impedes the speed of market price \nadjustment.\u201d The idea is that the market takes \nlonger to digest new information when the \nimplications are not obvious than when they are \nobvious. \nTo study this concept, financial economists \nexamined how new information about an \nindustry affected companies with a single \nbusiness versus conglomerates with multiple \nbusinesses. The authors provide a hypothetical \nexample of new information that reveals that \nchocolate consumption improves longevity. The \nstock price of a company that is in the chocolate \nbusiness only would react more quickly than the \nstock of a conglomerate that has a fraction of its \nbusiness in chocolate. The economists \u201cfind \nstrong evidence that easy-to-analyze firms \nincorporate industry information first, and hence \ntheir returns strongly predict the future updating \nof firm values that require more complicated \nanalyses.\u201d94 \nAnother case of task complexity is how the \nmarket reacts to information related to trading \npartners in a supply chain. In cases when two \ncompanies have businesses that are related, for \nexample one supplies the other, the market \nreflects new information about the first company \ninto the stock of the second company with a lag. \nInvestors can generate excess returns purchasing \nshares of the supplier following the release of \npositive news about its customer.95 \n"

These actions may make sense \nfor an individual firm but can create inefficiency. \nFurther, some trades are prompted by limits, \nrequirements, or constraints that the buyer or \nseller cannot avoid.    \nHere is a simple example. William Sharpe, an \neconomist who won the Nobel Prize in 1990, \nwrote a paper about active management that \nadvances two basic arguments. The first is that \nthe return on the average dollar managed \nactively will equal that of a dollar managed \npassively before costs. The second is that the \nreturn on the average dollar managed actively \nwill be less than that of a dollar managed \npassively after costs.97 \nSharpe\u2019s analysis, while practical, ignores the fact \nthat index funds have to buy and sell securities in \norder to reflect actions including stock sales and \npurchases by companies, as well as inclusions \nand deletions from the index. The annual cost of \nthis trading is estimated to be as low as 20 basis \npoints for funds that track well-known equity \nindexes and can be larger for bond funds.98 A \nsimilar argument applies to the arbitrage costs of \nkeeping the price equal to the net asset value for \nexchange-traded funds.99 We need active \nmanagers to take the other side of these trades. \nThere are a few examples of opportunity for \ntechnical edge. Importantly, each case requires \naccess to capital. One is to be on the other side \nof forced sellers or buyers. For example, some \ninvestors receive margin calls following a \ndrawdown and have to sell assets. Second is to \nconsider the opposite side of securities perturbed \nby investor fund flows. In this case, investment \nmanagers have to buy or sell securities and do so \nwith a predictable pattern. The final opportunity is \nto step in when traditional arbitrageurs have \nlimited access to capital and hence fail to fulfill \ntheir normal function. \nForced Buyers or Sellers. A straightforward \nexample of forced sellers is insurance companies \nthat must own investment-grade bonds. Indeed, \nmany insurance companies have portfolios that \nlook similar. Regulatory requirements compel \ninsurance companies to sell bonds that the credit \nagencies downgrade from investment grade to \nhigh yield. Research shows that these fire sales \nlead to an increase in yield spreads beyond what \nthe fundamentals justify. This creates a temporary \nmispricing, which tends to get corrected within \nmonths of the event.100     \nThe leverage cycle, developed by John \nGeanakoplos, a professor of economics at Yale \nUniversity, provides a useful framework for \nunderstanding forced selling. Central to \nGeanakoplos\u2019s argument is that to understand \nbooms and crashes, the ability to borrow is more \nimportant than the level of interest rates.101 \nOne measure of the ability to borrow is the \namount of debt, relative to equity, a buyer can \naccess to buy an asset. When the equity amount \nis low and the debt amount is high, the ability to \nborrow is easy. Leverage availability is \nprocyclical. It tends to be easier to borrow after \nasset prices are up and harder to borrow after \nthey are down.   \nGeanakoplos argues that some buyers place a \nhigher value on an asset than others for a host of \npotential reasons, including more optimism and \nhigher risk tolerance. These optimists use debt to \nbid up asset prices when leverage is easily \naccessible.  \nOptimistic buyers who have bid up asset prices \nfueled by debt create a setup for a crash. First, \nasset prices drop because of bad news, which \nheightens volatility, uncertainty, and \ndisagreement. The price decrease commonly \nfollows a sharp price increase. \nThe initial drop in asset prices triggers a big \ndecline in the wealth of optimistic asset owners. \nThe drawdown in asset prices forces the optimists \nto sell assets to meet their margin requirements. \nThis leads to additional declines in asset values, \nwhich triggers further selling, and so forth. These \noptimistic asset owners are selling for reasons that \nare unrelated to their view of fundamental value. \nBefore prices find a new equilibrium, lenders \nmake borrowing harder by requiring owners to \nput up more equity against their assets. This wipes \nout some buyers, leaving even fewer investors to \nsupport asset prices. Spillovers, when owners in \none asset class cover their losses by selling assets \nin other classes, become a risk. Investors who \n"

This is a fire \nsale.102 This creates a technical edge for investors \nwho can take the other side of the sale.   \nThe Importance of Fund Flows. Technical edge \ncan also arise from funds buying or selling specific \nsecurities as a result of investor inflows or outflows. \nHere\u2019s the basic outline.103 Investors tend to give \nmoney to investment funds that have done well \nand withdraw money from investment funds that \nhave done poorly. Investment managers who \nreceive additional capital tend to buy the \nsecurities they already own, and those who face \nwithdrawals have to sell securities in the portfolio.     \nAs a result, positive flows tend to create positive \nprice pressure and negative flows create \nnegative price pressure. These effects are \nparticularly pronounced for securities that are \nhard to trade and hence have a high cost of \nliquidity. This adds or detracts from fund results in \nthe short run, but the price effects reverse within \nmonths or in some cases years. One analysis \nconcludes that one-third of hedge fund excess \nreturn, or alpha, is attributable to investor flows.104 \nOne of the ways we can think about \u201cWho is on \nthe other side?\u201d is by sorting between trades \ninduced by fundamental value and those \ninduced by liquidity. Stocks bought or sold for \nfundamental reasons reveal \u201cstock-picking skill,\u201d \nwhile stocks traded for liquidity reasons exhibit \n\u201cnegative performance effects.\u201d105 There is some \nevidence that sophisticated funds already take \nadvantage of this technical inefficiency.106 \nWhen Arbitrageurs Fail to Show Up. A technical \ninefficiency can also arise when arbitrageurs \nhave insufficient capital to close gaps between \nprice and value. With pure arbitrage, an investor \nbuys and sells identical assets that have different \nprices, say gold in London and New York, and \nlocks in a profit. There is no risk and no capital \nneeded. These opportunities are scarce. With risk \narbitrage, an investor buys and sells assets but is \nnot assured a profit, hence the introduction of \n\u201crisk.\u201d107 Arbitrageurs are plentiful in the \ninvestment community, and under normal \nconditions they have sufficient capital to \nprofitably remove divergences between price \nand value. But they do not have unlimited \ncapital. \nProfessional arbitrageurs are generally agents. \nTheir capital comes from principals such as \nwealthy individuals, endowments, or pension \nfunds. They negotiate with prime brokers to set \nthe amount and cost of leverage they can use. \nHistory shows that both principals and lenders \nretrench in instances of extreme stress, and \nmeaningful arbitrage opportunities persist. This \ncan create advantage. \nLong-Term Capital Management (LTCM) is a case \nstudy that incorporates many of the sources of \ninefficiency we have discussed. Founded in 1994, \nLTCM enjoyed compound annual returns in \nexcess of 30 percent in its first 4 years, but \neffectively went bust in 1998. The demise was the \nresult of exposure to Russia, which devalued its \ncurrency and defaulted on its debt, in August \n1998, and losses in highly leveraged positions, \namong other issues. A consortium of banks bailed \nout the fund and eventually liquidated it at a \nmodest profit.  \nOne aspect of LTCM\u2019s troubles that tends to get \nshort shrift is the degree to which other funds and \nbanks mimicked the fund\u2019s positions. Consistent \nwith Blake LeBaron\u2019s agent-based model, other \nfinancial institutions copied LTCM\u2019s trades, hence \nmaking them crowded and increasing the \nmarket\u2019s fragility. Also similar to LeBaron\u2019s model, \nimitation was a benefit to returns early on but \nmade finding new profitable trades more difficult.  \nIn July 1998, Sandy Weill, then CEO of the \nTravelers Group, decided to shut down the U.S. \narbitrage desk of Salomon Brothers. Travelers had \nacquired Salomon in the fall of 1997 and had just \nagreed to merge with Citicorp.

Using five-year \nhistorical data, the correlation between LTCM\u2019s \npositions was less than 0.10 through early 1998 \n(where zero means there is no correlation at all \nand 1.0 means perfect correlation). To stress test \nthe portfolio, LTCM\u2019s risk managers assumed the \ncorrelations could reach 0.30, a figure they \ndeemed improbable. The correlation skyrocketed \nto 0.70 as the crisis unfolded, rendering traditional \nrisk management tools essentially useless.109  \nBy early September 1998, after having lost 44 \npercent of its capital in August, LTCM sent out a \ncommunication to its clients that the opportunity \nset looked unusually attractive. The missive \nimmediately became public. Rather than having \nthe intended outcome of securing additional \ncapital, it created additional pressure on LTCM\u2019s \npositions and sparked concern among \ncounterparties. In so doing, LTCM is also a vivid \nexample of the leverage cycle.  \nThe story of LTCM reveals how technical \ninefficiencies arise as the result of a lack of well-\ncapitalized arbitrageurs. While the conditions \nwere extreme, these episodes occur in markets \nfrom time to time. Access to capital is key to the \nability to take advantage of these chances.  \nBefore leaving the topic of technical \ninefficiencies, it is worth mentioning two other \nareas: spin-offs and the impact on stock prices of \nadding and removing stocks from prominent \nindexes. Both have been sources of opportunity \nhistorically, but they appear to be more muted \nopportunities today. It is worth watching each, \nespecially spin-offs, for potential technical edge.   \nA spin-off is the result of a distribution of shares of \na wholly-owned subsidiary to a parent \ncompany\u2019s shareholders on a pro-rata and tax-\nfree basis. Joel Greenblatt, founder of Gotham \nCapital, explains that the opportunity for \ntechnical edge arises because, \u201cOnce the \nspinoff\u2019s shares are distributed to the parent \ncompany\u2019s shareholders, they are typically sold \nimmediately without regard to price or \nfundamental value.\u201d110  \nHistorically, spin-offs have created value on \naverage for the companies spun off as well as \nthe parents.111 One meta-analysis of the literature \non spin-offs summarized their findings by saying: \n\u201cThe main conclusion is consistent: spin-offs are \nassociated with strongly significant abnormal \nreturns.\u201d Factors that contribute to this value \ncreation include sharpened corporate focus, \nbetter information for investors, enhanced merger \nand acquisition opportunities, and in some cases \ntax treatment.112 \nAs good of an investment opportunity that spin-\noffs have been historically, they have not \ndelivered as much value in recent years. For \nexample, the Invesco S&P Spin-Off ETF (CSD) has \nlagged the S&P 500 by about 17 percentage \npoints cumulatively in the 2 years ended \nDecember 2018. That said, spin-offs potentially \ncombine analytical, informational, and technical \ninefficiencies and are worth monitoring in the \nsearch for edge. \nIn classic economic theory, demand curves for \nstocks are close to flat by means of arbitrage \nbetween perfect substitutes. Because there are \nfew perfect substitutes in the world, stocks and \nother assets are subject to demand shocks. If the \ndemand curve shifts up, the stock price has to rise \nto clear the market.   \nDemand shocks can have a meaningful impact \non asset price valuation. For instance, financial \neconomists showed that the institutionalization of \ninvestment management in the 1980s and 1990s \nled to demand for large capitalization stocks. By \ntheir estimate, this demand contributed 230 basis \npoints to the aggregate 260 basis point \noutperformance of large capitalization versus \nsmall capitalization stocks from 1980 through 1996 \n(see exhibit 10).113 \nExhibit 10: Demand Shock and Large Cap versus \nSmall Cap Performance (1980-1996)  \n \nSource: Paul A.

Inclusion in the index, for example, \ncreates demand from index funds with no \nchange in the fundamentals of the company. This \nis a textbook case of a technical inefficiency, \nwhere index funds have to buy for reasons that \nhave nothing to do with value. \nThe substantial body of research on this topic \nshows that demand curves slope down and as a \nresult inclusion into an index has a positive, if \ntemporary, impact on the stock price.114 \nHowever, more recent work suggests that effect \nhas become much more muted in the past \ndecade, reflecting greater transparency and \nlower transaction costs.115 Index funds have to \nbuy and sell in order to be aligned with the index \nitself. But the big index funds do this very \nefficiently.  \nHow does an investor effectively take advantage \nof technical inefficiencies?  \n\uf0b7 Be on the lookout for forced sellers. From \ntime to time, certain market participants are \ncompelled to buy or sell securities without \nregard for fundamental value.

For a long time, \nspin-offs have been a great illustration of a \ntechnical inefficiency. But in recent years, \nperhaps as a result of the publication of \nthese results, spin-offs have not fared as well. \nStill, we believe it is worthwhile to evaluate \nspin-offs as they are announced to see if an \ninformational or analytical opportunity exists. \n"

Yet agency \ntheory is rarely used in academic work on asset \npricing, including the CAPM model and the \nBlack-Scholes options pricing model.  \nThere is an edifying distinction in asset \nmanagement between the business of investing \nand the profession of investing.120 The business of \ninvesting dwells on generating profit for the \ninvestment firm, often by growing assets under \nmanagement and charging healthy fees. The \nprofession of investing focuses on managing \nportfolios to maximize long-term, risk-adjusted \nreturns. Of course, a vibrant business is essential to \nthe profession if only to attract and retain talent. \nAgency costs arise when an investment firm \nprioritizes the business over the profession. \nPointing out this principal-agent problem may be \nuseful, but it says little about actual asset pricing.  \nThere are a couple of plausible reasons that the \nprincipal-agent problem and financial institutions \ndo not play a large role in asset-pricing models. \nThe first is that there was not much of a principal-\nagent problem as asset pricing theory \ndeveloped. For instance, individuals directly \nowned more than 90 percent of equities in the \nUnited States in 1950 and still owned just under 50 \npercent in 1980.121 At the time that core theories \nabout asset pricing were established in the 1960s \nand 1970s, financial institutions were simply not \nthe dominant factor that they are today. A lack \nof agents led to a lack of agency theory for asset \npricing. \n \n \n \n \nThe other reason reflects the theoretical \nfoundations for the efficient market hypothesis.122 \nThere are essentially three ways to get to efficient \nmarkets. The first is to assume that investors are \nrational, which means they understand their \npreferences and the distribution of asset price \nreturns, and they know how to make an optimal \ntrade-off between risk and reward.  \nNo one believes investors can actually do this, \nbut it may be a useful model to the extent the \nmarket behaves as if this is what is going on. \nMilton Friedman, who was a professor of \neconomics at the University of Chicago and won \nthe Nobel Prize in 1976, used the analogy of an \nexpert billiards player. His point is that the billiards \nplayer is certainly not solving \u201ccomplicated \nmathematical formulas\u201d to sink her shots but you \ncan make good predictions about her results by \nassuming that she does.123 The market\u2019s empirical \nresults, especially at extremes, undermines this \nargument.   \nAnother way to get to efficient markets is to \nassume that a smart subset of investors, \narbitrageurs, cruise markets and close gaps \nbetween price and value. The allure of \narbitrageurs is that we can relax the assumption \nthat all investors are rational and retain a \nplausible mechanism to attain efficiency. As we \nhave seen, arbitrageurs are active in markets but \nhave failed to ensure efficiency at key times.124  \nThe final way to achieve efficiency is through the \nwisdom of crowds. Here, a price that is equivalent \nto value is the result of an effective aggregation \nof the views of a group of investors who are \ncognitively diverse and have appropriate \nincentives.125 This approach does not work when \nthe key conditions are not in place.126      \nEach case takes for granted the institutions and \nmechanisms on the path to efficiency.127 And in \neach case, we now know that the institutions \nmake a big difference. Many of the gaps \nbetween theory and practice are the source of \nthe inefficiencies that we describe in this report.\n"

      "text": " \nBL U EM O UN TA IN INV ES TM E NT RESE A RC H  \n30 \nAppendix B: Factors\u2014Risk or Behavioral?\nOne lively debate in finance is whether the \nexcess returns of certain factors, relative to the \ncapital asset pricing model, reflect risk or \nmispricing due to behavioral issues. Practitioners \ncannot viably use most of the 450-plus such \nanomalies that finance researchers have \nidentified and many that they can implement are \nless robust than the research suggests.128 The \nability to implement and robustness are essential \nstandards for empirical finance.  \nWithin this \u201cfactor zoo,\u201d129 six factors are widely \nused in the investment community, including \nbeta (measured though the capital asset pricing \nmodel),130 size (small capitalization stocks \ngenerate higher returns than large capitalization \nstocks), value (low-multiple stocks outperform \nhigh-multiple ones),131 momentum (stocks that rise \ncontinue to rise in the short term),132 quality (high-\nquality companies outperform low-quality \ncompanies),133 and asset growth (low asset \ngrowth companies outperform high asset growth \ncompanies).134 Eugene Fama and Kenneth \nFrench, a professor of finance at the Tuck School \nof Business at Dartmouth College, recommend a \nfive-factor model that includes all of the above \nsave momentum.135  \nThe critical question is whether the excess returns \nthese factors imply reflect risk or a combination of \narbitrage costs and behavioral mistakes by \ninvestors.136 If the returns are the result of risk the \nCAPM misses, the factors are useful for capturing \nthat risk. This brings you back to efficient markets, \nwhere your long-term returns as an investor are \ncommensurate with the risk that you accept. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe answer is that the excess returns from factors \nreflect both risk and behavioral mistakes. But \nsome may be more behaviorally-oriented than \nothers. Andrew Ang, a former professor of finance \nat Columbia Business School and now the head \nof factor investing strategies at BlackRock, a \nlarge asset management firm, recommends \nasking whether a factor works based on whether \nit rewards risk, takes advantage of a structural \nimpediment, or capitalizes on behavioral \nbiases.137  \nWhile explaining the exact source of excess \nreturns for any factor is inherently difficult, solid \nevidence suggests that the value,138 \nmomentum,139 and quality140 factors have a large \ndose of behavioral influence. Risk appears to be \nthe main driver of excess returns for the CAPM \nand size factors.    \nThe source of excess return from a given factor is \nrelevant for answering the question of who is on \nthe other side of a trade. If excess returns relative \nto the CAPM\u2019s predictions reflect risk, then the \nfactors are helpful in making sure you are \nreceiving proper compensation. If excess returns \nreflect behavioral issues, they suggest a source of \nreturns that are both extra and recurring. But the \nsums that winners earn must be offset by the sums \nthat losers surrender.  \n"

The first is to determine which value driver is \nmost important for a business. One way to do this is to examine the correlation between that driver \nand total shareholder returns. For most companies, the key value driver is sales growth. The correlation \nbetween three-year sales growth rates and total shareholder returns, considering a large sample of \ncompanies, is about 0.25.  \nYou then want to assess the reliability of that driver. In other words, you measure the persistence of \nsales growth rates. The correlation between sales growth rates from one year to the next is about 0.30. \nFinally, you want to integrate the base rate. The base rate would be the actual rate of sales growth for \nall comparable companies. The reliability correlation gives you a hint about how to blend the \nindividual company\u2019s results with the base rate. If the correlation is low, you should place nearly all of \nthe weight on the base rate. These are cases when the strength is low and the weight, via the base \nrate, is high. \nIf the correlation is high, you can emphasize the individual company\u2019s results. This is the case where \nboth strength and weight are high.   \n65 Chetan Dave and Katherine W.
