For many companies the past is prologue; companies \nalways strive to get bigger and better, but their fundamental activities don\u2019t change much. These goods and \nservices businesses generally have production-based roots and classic industrial economics effectively address \ntheir growth and business model characteristics. \nIn recent years, information technology and networks have merged to create companies with characteristics \nquite different from their production-based counterparts. These include unprecedented market shares, very high \nreturns on invested capital, and rapid growth.  As important, the market doesn\u2019t always anticipate how the \nfundamentals of these companies unfold, leading to investable opportunities. 3  \nNetworks\u2014canals, railroads, and highways\u2014have been around for a long time and played an important role in \nglobal economic development. However, our primary interest is not in physical networks but rather in networks \nthat rely on information technology. \nEconomists have successfully described the economics of both information and networks. These economic \nprinciples appear durable. It is the combination of information and network properties that creates opportunities \nfor businesses and investors. Most investors have not internalized these ideas.     \nWe believe the importance of information-based networks is increasing in today\u2019s global economy for four \nreasons: \n1. Physical capital needs are lower than they were in the past. Information-based networks require less \ncapital as they grow than physical networks do. \n2. Networks demonstrate increasing returns. Most industries benefit from supply-side increasing returns to \nscale: higher volume leads to lower unit costs, up to a point. In contrast, successful networks generate \nincreasing returns from the demand-side as users beget users. \n3. Networks can form faster and more frequently than in the past. Because of plummeting communication \nand computing costs, the barriers to creating a network are declining. But even though the barriers to \nentry are low, the barriers to success remain high. \n4. Networks can spread globally. Because many networks have high upfront costs and low incremental \ncosts, they can expand rapidly within countries and across borders. \nThis report focuses on how to categorize networks, how they affect economic value, and how they form. \nNetwork Effects \nImagine you are the first person to own a fax machine. It is effectively worthless because of its inability to \ncommunicate with other machines. As more people purchase faxes, the value of your machine rises sharply: the \nlarger the network of users, the greater the value of the network. \nMore formally, we know this concept as network effects. A network effect exists when the value of a good or \nservice increases as more people use that good or service. In a typical network, the addition of a new customer \nincreases the willingness of all participants to pay for network services. 4   \nEthernet inventor Bob Metcalfe formalized this idea mathematically in the 1970s. Metcalfe\u2019s Law states that the \nvalue (V) of a network increases by the square of its nodes (n). Metcalfe\u2019s formula states that V = n2 \u2013 n. So a \nnetwork of ten people has a value of ninety (100 \u2013 10 = 90) but a network twice the size has a value three times \nhigher (400 \u2013 20 = 380). While Metcalfe\u2019s fundamental insight is correct, the precise formula has no basis in \neconomic theory and substantially overstates the value of large networks. 5 \nMetcalfe also noted that the costs are unlikely to rise as fast as the value of the network. After reaching some \npoint of critical mass (we\u2019ll return to this idea later), value soars. In Metcalfe\u2019s words: 6 \nWhen you connect computers together, the cost of doing so is n, but the value is n2, because each of the \nmachines that you hook up gets to talk to all of the other machines on the network. When you graph that, you \nsee that over time your costs go down while the value of the network goes up. \nNetwork effects are central to evaluating networks, but we have to bear in mind that the intensity of network \neffects varies from network-to-network and that network values dissipate at different user-base levels. \n"

(See Exhibit 1.) In a \nradial network, a hub reaches out to spokes. Major airlines and retailers are examples.  \nNetwork effects tend to be weak for radial networks. Think of a traditional hub-and-spoke airline. As long as the \ncarrier takes you where you want to go, you probably don\u2019t care if other passengers use the same service (in \nfact, ideally you\u2019d like to have the middle seat empty). But network effects do exist, because more passengers \nallow the airline to expand routes and provide users with additional services.   \nIn a combinatorial network, the nodes connect directly to one another. These networks can often expand \nsubstantially without degrading the service. Illustrations include telecommunication systems and on-line auction \ncompanies. Combinatorial networks generally possess strong network effects. These networks are relatively \nrare. \nExhibit 1: Radial versus Combinatorial Networks \nRadial\nCombinatorial\nRadial\nCombinatorial\n \nSource: LMCM. \nAs investors, we\u2019re interested in situations where network effects are powerful and where a company can \ncapture the economic benefits. These benefits show up in rapid sales growth, rising margins, and high and \nsustainable returns on invested capital. \nAll networks need some dimension of compatibility, or a reason for users to come to the network. Compatibility \ntakes three fundamental forms: \n\u2022 \nTransactions.  A network based on transaction compatibility derives its value from creating a forum \nfor economic exchange. As more buyers and sellers join the network, the network value grows \nsharply. Companies capturing a sliver from each transaction in return for hosting the network see \ntheir value rise along with network growth. \nThe canonical example for a transaction network is eBay, the first to attain scale in online auction. \neBay has realized tremendous growth in registered users, gross merchandise sales, sales, and \nprofits since its inception less than ten years ago. Other illustrations include Innocentive (an online \ncommunity to solve R&D problems) and Tradesports (an online trading and betting exchange). \n\u2022 \nCommunity. These networks allow for, and derive value from, direct interaction between members. \nThese networks are not about economic exchange but rather finding and connecting with the right \nperson. Further, a gathered community has value for content providers, advertisers, and vendors.  \nNextel Communications benefits from community-based network effects. Nextel\u2019s push-to-talk \ntechnology allows users to communicate rapidly and effortlessly. This technology is especially \nvaluable for small businesses with workers in the field. Other examples of community networks \ninclude AOL\u2019s instant messaging, Skype (Internet-based communications), Partypoker.com, \nFriendster, and InterActive Corporation\u2019s Match.com. \n\u2022 \nComplementary. The values of these networks depend on the availability of ancillary and \ncomplementary goods or services. Often they reflect the co-evolution of hardware and software.  \nThe interplay between game console makers (Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft) and game software \nproducers (Electronic Arts, Activision) is a good example of a complementary network. New \ngenerations of hardware spawn better software, and vice versa. 7  \nAfter establishing the basics of networks effects and outlining some different network types, we\u2019re now ready to \nlook at the economics of networks: how and why they create value. \n"

We can express excess returns as the \ndifference between sales and costs (including the opportunity cost of capital) and the duration of excess returns \nas the result of competitive advantage.  \nIn this section, we explore ways networks generate revenues, their cost dynamics, and how they sustain returns. \nAnalysis of these drivers provides a foundation for assessing and judging appropriate valuations for network \nbusinesses.  \nSales \nWe need to consider two dimensions of sales: the sources and the growth rate. Both are important, but the rate \nof growth holds particular interest because it can be nonlinear when strong network effects exist. Since the stock \nmarket tends to be poor at discounting nonlinear growth, this may provide opportunities. 8  \nFirst, we outline sales sources. Many established networks gather sales from more than one of these categories, \nand in some instances there are revenue opportunities that developed networks have yet to exploit. More than \nclassifying sales, these categories provide a way to think about potential value creation. 9 \n\u2022 \nCommerce/transactions. Companies that are a de facto standard or stewards of a network can either \nsell goods directly or can steer customers to a transaction and collect a fee (indirect). Direct sales \nare conceptually straightforward and generally easy to track. The success of a company\u2019s indirect \nsales relates to its ability to reduce customer search costs. Large networks that can effectively direct \nusers are very valuable.  \n\u2022 \nAdvertising. A large user network attracts advertisers by allowing them to reach users cost \neffectively. Companies that amassed such groups can monetize them by selling advertising. Since \nan advertising-based business model is typically only viable for companies with a sizable user base, \ncompanies trying to build such a model often discount or give away their product in order to corral \nusers. The give-away is a costly means to a profitable end: becoming an attractive vehicle for \nadvertisers. This currently forms the core of Google\u2019s business model. \n\u2022 \nSubscription. Some successful networks can charge users a subscription fee, or dues, for access to \na network and its content. Subscription models usually apply for one of two extremes: very \nspecialized networks or very large networks.    \n\u2022 \nData. One of the benefits\u2014and concerns\u2014of the digital age is an unprecedented ability to collect \ninformation. Companies with large user bases, especially those Internet-based, have a treasure \nchest of data about their customers that is valuable because it can be sold to third parties. These \ndata can be either aggregated, hence skirting privacy issues, or used to offer specific consumer \nprofiles.  \n\u2022 \nIncubation. Once established, a network can \u201clink-and-leverage\u201d its position into new business \nopportunities. 10 This means transferring a user base to an adjacent technology or product. For \nexample, Microsoft used its strong operating system position to capture adjacent markets in \napplications and Internet browsers.  \nNow that we have outlined revenue sources, we can return to the issue of growth rates. To do that, we must \nintroduce and explore the notion of positive feedback\u2014the idea that the strong get stronger and (as necessary \ncorollary) the weak get weaker. We will explore two related facets of positive feedback: winner-take-most \noutcomes and supply- versus demand-side scale economies. \nWinner takes most. In the presence of network effects, the value of a good or service increases as more people \nadopt that good or service. But what happens when multiple products compete in a business subject to network \neffects? Often one company gathers the vast majority of market share\u2014the winner takes most.  \nConsider the case of the VHS versus Beta video recorder standard-setting battle in the late 1970s and early \n1980s.11 The two technologies competed across a range of features, including product design, picture quality, \nplaying time, and price.  While the point is in dispute, the two products were generally viewed as similar in \ncapability.  \n"

Copyright \u00a9 1992 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College; all \nrights reserved. \nEconomist W. Brian Arthur says it more bluntly in what we can call Arthur\u2019s Law: Of networks, there will be few.12\nIn a particular space one network tends to dominate, while the rest fight over the scraps. Network builders \nunderstand that anything other than first place is an also-ran. Microsoft and eBay\u2019s 90%-plus market shares offer \ntestament to this point. Natural monopolies are the progeny of strong network effects.  \nOne important idea here is path dependence, which in general means that history matters. Economists \ninterested in innovation often point to path dependence to show why small events\u2014random choices, luck, a \nchance meeting\u2014can lead to outcomes unexplained solely by product attributes and features. While some \neconomists doubt the role of path dependence, studies of networks outside of economics suggest that path \ndependence is an important consideration. 13 \n"

The difference between a firm\u2019s sales and costs (including \nopportunity cost) determine whether or not it creates value. 14 Fundamentally, a company can create more value \nby either reducing its costs or increasing the price it receives. Evidence suggests that differences in customer \nwillingness-to-pay account for more of the profit variability among competitors than disparities in cost levels. 15   \nPositive feedback as a result of scale economies has been around for a long time. The well-known cost curve \nshows that as a manufacturing company increases its output, its marginal and average unit costs decline (to a \npoint). For these companies, the positive feedback is supply-side driven. It\u2019s all about lowering costs. This is \nclassic increasing returns-to-scale. \nHowever, for manufacturing companies positive feedback tends to dissipate because of bureaucracy, \ncomplexity, or input scarcity. This generally happens at a level well before dominance: Market shares in the \nindustrial world rarely top 50%. \nFor networks, the primary source of positive feedback is network effects. Rather than being supply-side driven, \nnetwork effects are demand-side driven. This has two implications. First, the value to the users increases sharply \nonce a network passes critical mass. Irrespective of costs, the willingness-to-pay rises.  \nSecond, size does not govern market share for networks based on information. One network can, and often \ndoes, become totally dominant. Recognition of networks effects as the primary driver of increasing returns is key. \nExhibit 4 illustrates the distinction between supply- and demand-side scale economies. \nExhibit 4: Supply- versus Demand-Side Driven Scale Economies \nAverage Cost per unit\nOutput\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nopportunity\ncost\ncost\nprice\nwillingness-to-pay\nsupplier\u2019s share\nfirm\u2019s share\nbuyer\u2019s share\nTotal Value Created\nWillingness-to-pay\nUsers\nSupply-side\nDemand-side\nAverage Cost per unit\nOutput\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nopportunity\ncost\ncost\nprice\nwillingness-to-pay\nsupplier\u2019s share\nfirm\u2019s share\nbuyer\u2019s share\nTotal Value Created\nWillingness-to-pay\nUsers\nSupply-side\nDemand-side\n \nSource: LMCM. \nCosts \nMany of the networks formed in recent years are based more on information than physical assets. One of the \ndistinctions between the industrial economy and the information economy is the nature of costs. The hallmark of \nan information good is high upfront and low incremental cost. Think of a piece of software. Writing code the first \ntime is costly. Once finished, the cost of replicating and distributing that code is often very low.  \nWhen network effects and the cost characteristics of information goods merge, the results are potentially \nsignificant. A surge in demand-side driven sales, coupled with negligible incremental cost, can lead to significant \nvalue creation. As a result some network businesses garnered multi-billion dollar valuations very quickly.  \n"

As long as an information-based product or service stays current, sales and costs can \nbecome uncoupled for a time.    \nBut there is bad news. Typically, developing an information-oriented network requires significant upfront costs. \nMoreover, only one company will likely get a disproportionate percentage of the economic profit. Many try, and \nfew succeed.  \nNext, the high-fixed-cost, low-variable-cost structure of information companies may lead to greater profit \nvariability as broader economic circumstances affect sales growth. Strong evidence suggests that cost structure \nplayed an important role in the sharp profit drop and upswing in recent years. 16 \nFinally, while information-based networks may have low variable costs, they must keep spending for their \nproducts or services to stay up-to-date at the risk of losing users to a more technologically advanced offering.  \nSustainability \nWe believe networks provide one of the few sources of sustainable competitive advantage. Once entrenched, \ndominant networks prove difficult to dislodge. Network users become locked-in, and their switching costs rise \nsharply. Lock-in and switching costs are central to a network\u2019s sustainable competitive advantage.   \nUsers must bear switching costs when they switch from one system to another. These costs fall into a number of \ncategories. Here are the three we consider most important: 17  \n\u2022 \nReplacement cost. Once you purchase a product in a complementary network\u2014say you had a great \nvinyl record collection and turntable\u2014you have to bear the cost to change networks (and buy a CD \nplayer). This cost declines as the durable good ages. \n\u2022 \nLearning cost. Once you learn to use a product (application software is a good example) changing \nvendors will require you to spend time learning a new system. This is also relevant for airlines as they \nselect aircraft: it\u2019s easier to fly and maintain similar planes than to use multiple aircraft. \n"

Consider the daunting decision the first customer \nfaces as they ponder a switch to a new network. Even if the new network is inherently better, there are no \nnetwork effects with a single user. So that individual faces huge switching costs.  \nEven if a sufficient number of people are willing to switch to a superior network, coordination presents many \ndifficulties. In fact, collective switching costs are far higher than all individual switching costs because of this \ncoordination hurdle. \nWhen evaluating a network of users, you have to consider switching costs on a per user basis and aggregate \nthose costs. Small switching costs for a huge user base can be equivalent to large switching costs for a single \nuser, even though the latter is much easier to appreciate. Most companies benefiting from network effects \nunderstand this point and work hard to increase lock-in (often called stickiness). \nNetwork Formation \nWe now turn to the question of how networks form. If you want to understand network formation, you can start by \nthinking about how the flu spreads. There are two key dimensions, both intuitive. First, the degree of interaction \ndescribes how often people run into one another. Second, the degree of contagiousness describes how easily \nthe flu spreads.  \nWith a lot of interaction but a mildly contagious flu strand, the flu will not take off. A highly contagious flu strand \nwith isolated carriers will not take off either. But combine contagiousness with interaction, and you\u2019ve got an \nepidemic.      \nAs it turns out, the graphs of how innovations and diseases spread both follow an S-curve. Adoption starts \nslowly and increases at an increasing rate once the innovation (disease) takes hold. Exhibit 7 shows the familiar \npattern. \nExhibit 7: S-Curve \nCumulative adopters\nTime\nCumulative adopters\nTime\n \nSource: LMCM. \n"

We can model the degree of interaction \nusing insights from network research. And we can model susceptibility, or contagiousness, as adoption \nthresholds. This metaphor does have limitations, but captures many of the important features of network \ngrowth.18 \nBefore proceeding we need to distinguish between how non-interactive and interactive innovations diffuse. The \nbenefit of a non-interactive innovation increases for future adopters as more and more individuals adopt. So it \nfollows an S-curve. With interactive innovations\u2014including networks with strong network effects\u2014earlier \nadopters influence later adopters, but later adopters also influence earlier adopters. The benefits from each \nadditional adoption flow to all existing and future users. As a result, an interactive innovation follows a much \nsteeper S-curve (see Exhibit 8). \nExhibit 8: Interactive Innovations Follow a Steeper S-Curve \n100%\nAdoption Rate\nfor an Interactive\nInnovation\nTime\nAdoption Percent\nAdoption Rate\nfor a Non-Interactive\nInnovation\n100%\nAdoption Rate\nfor an Interactive\nInnovation\nTime\nAdoption Percent\nAdoption Rate\nfor a Non-Interactive\nInnovation\n \nSource:  LMCM. \nWe all know only a handful of innovations succeed. So what\u2019s the key to rapid adoption? The good or service \nhas to achieve critical mass, a metaphor borrowed from physics. Critical mass is the key to detonating an atom \nbomb. When the unstable nucleus of uranium breaks up, it releases energy. Neutrons emanating from the \nbreakup of one may hit another and cause it to break up, but most neutrons miss other nuclei and project \nharmlessly into space. If, however, you appropriately condense the quantity of uranium\u2014critical mass\u2014the \ntypical neutron that leaves one nucleus will hit another, and so on, causing a self-sustaining chain reaction.    \nSimilarly, an innovation is said to reach critical mass when adoption begins to increase at an increasing rate. \nEven if a company stops actively promoting the innovation, the process continues. The innovation is self-\nsustaining, and it becomes nearly impossible for competitors (and the company\u2019s management miscues) to \nchange the course.  \nMost people don\u2019t adopt an innovation based solely on its intrinsic benefits. The actions of other people influence \nthem, and not all adopters are equivalent in their potential to be influenced. (This is one of the key limitations in \napplying a biological metaphor.)   \nIndividuals have an adoption threshold, defined by the number of other people who must engage in an activity \nbefore a given individual joins in. Think of a recent fad or fashion. Were you an early adopter (low adoption \nthreshold) or did you wait until nearly everyone else adopted (high adoption threshold) before you jumped in?  \nInterestingly, adoption in an individual\u2019s personal communication network influences them more than aggregate \nadoption. This means that the structure of communication networks helps assess how the diffusion process \nworks for interactive innovations. An innovation spreads much more quickly over a network with an average of \nsix degrees of separation than one with sixty. Studies of the small world effect have formally explored the \nstructure of social networks.  \n"

For example, clustering reflects the extent to which your friends know one another. \nNot surprisingly, many real-world networks are highly clustered.  \nWhen modeling networks, researchers discovered something fascinating: Just a few, random long-range \nconnections between local, clustered networks dramatically reduce the degrees of separation. A social analogy \nwould be a tightly knit group of friends living in Boston, with a member still in contact with friends in San \nFrancisco. With just a few random links, and the overall degrees of separation plummet. \nHow does this affect network formation? The tremendous potential of a network is not a function of how many \npeople have adopted it. Rather, a network\u2019s potential comes from how many non-adopters are in the social \ncluster of the adopters. The true power of the network effect lies in the adoption cascade through the various \nsocial clusters. Given the degree of interconnectedness the Internet affords, the small world effect suggests \nnetwork formation should occur more rapidly than ever.  \nIn fact, it does.  Less than six months after its launch, Hotmail, a free email service, registered its 1 millionth \nuser. And less than 18 months later, the subscriber number shot up to over 12 million people.  Skype, a peer-to-\npeer Internet communications company, gathered 9.5 million users in its first year. 19 \nWe can now summarize three key points: \n\u2022 \nInteractive innovations, including networks, grow at a faster rate than non-interactive ones. \n\u2022 \nAn individual\u2019s adoption threshold is defined by how many other people in their social cluster engage in \nan activity before they join in as well. \n\u2022 \nThe small world effect shows us how communications technology makes us more connected to one \nanother than ever before.  \nSo far, we have focused largely on the architecture of network formation. We will now review the process of \nformation. For that, we turn to the dean of diffusion, Everett Rogers. Rogers first published his classic book, \nDiffusion of Innovations, in 1962.  \nThe familiar S-curve represents cumulative adopters of an innovation. Rogers found that the plot of new \nadopters tends to follow a normal distribution (see Exhibit 9). This insight allowed him to partition adopters based \non how early they are willing to adopt an innovation relative to others. Rogers broke adopters into five groups, \nbased on statistical measures. Fans of technology strategist Geoff Moore\u2014especially his books Crossing the \nChasm and Inside the Tornado\u2014will find the graphic and nomenclature familiar. Crossing the chasm means \ngetting to critical mass. \nExhibit 9: Adopter Categorization \nInnovators\nEarly\nAdopters\nEarly\nMajority\nLate\nMajority\nLaggards\nInnovators\nEarly\nAdopters\nEarly\nMajority\nLate\nMajority\nLaggards\n \nSource: Geoffrey A. Moore, Crossing the Chasm (New York: HarperBusiness, 1991), 12. Copyrighted material, used by permission. \nThe process starts with innovators and early adopters. Innovators are a group obsessed with \n\u201cventuresomeness.\u201d They are known for their technological savvy and willingness to cope with the distinct \npossibility that the mainstream will never adopt the innovation. The innovators are the gatekeepers of new ideas.\n"

Since early \nadopters often provide advice, they understand that they must make judicious innovation decisions. \nIn an attempt to get to critical mass, the early majority is the crucial group. The transition from early adopters to \nthe early majority is the chasm. The early majority remains cautious about embracing a new idea. Still, this large \ngroup provides a key ingredient any innovation needs\u2014legitimacy. \nInteractive networks encourage adoption by providing the early majority incentives that a regular network can\u2019t. \nOnce an interactive network takes root, strong network effects provide benefits that fit neatly with the needs of \nlater adopters, thus accelerating overall adoption rates. In contrast to the innovators and early adopters, the \nearly majority can clearly see the benefit of network effects and factor them into the decision making process.  \nTransaction networks have more liquidity, device markets supply more complementary products, and community \nnetworks contain more members with which to interact. This factor becomes a substantial input in the value \ncalculus, rather than just the intrinsic product merit. \nExhaustive studies of innovation diffusion show that the point of critical mass is typically between 5% and 20% \npenetration of the total market. Beyond this point, increased adoption becomes self-sustaining. Moore calls this \nperiod of growth \u201cthe tornado.\u201d \nYou can also view critical mass as the \u201ctipping point.\u201d When two or more firms compete for a market where there \nis strong feedback, one typically emerges as the winner. The point of no return, where one company\u2019s success \nbegets further success, occurs at the tipping point.  \nThe real message in the tipping point is an economic one. Typically one or more companies will vie to become \nthe network of choice. Early market share gains come with great challenge and expense. If by skill, foresight, or \nluck one company gets a lead in a \u201ctippy\u201d market, positive feedback will likely to carry it to the tipping point, or \npoint of critical mass. 20 From there, it is shareholder value nirvana: market share rises precisely as the cost of \ngaining that market share declines. \nExhibit 10 provides a complete map of critical mass. We can describe critical mass in three ways: \n\u2022 \nThe inflection point\u2014or elbow\u2014in an S-curve. \n\u2022 \nThe transition from the early adopters to the early majority\u2014 or \u201ccrossing the chasm.\u201d \n\u2022 \nThe tipping point, where incremental market share comes at incrementally lower cost.  \nWhile our discussion dwelled largely on the mechanics of network formation, we cannot lose sight of the fact that \nmost networks never get to critical mass. Equally important, however, is that an intrinsically valuable network or \ninnovation won\u2019t necessarily win in the market place. A great offering is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition \nfor getting to critical mass. \n"
