      "text": " \n \nJune 4, 2015 \n \nTriple Crown Teachings \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nTo be part of the pantheon of horse racing in the United States requires winning the Triple Crown\u2014the \nKentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. The three races cover different distances \nand occur over a span of just five weeks. It is an extraordinarily hard task for a horse. Indeed, only eleven have \nachieved it in the past century. \n \nOn Saturday, June 6th, 2015, American Pharoah will be the 32nd horse to attempt to complete the feat.2 Up to \nthat point, the three-year-old bay colt had won five of the six races he had entered including victories by a \nmargin of one length at the Kentucky Derby and a more impressive seven lengths at the Preakness.   \n \nWhether American Pharoah wins or losses, the path to the Triple Crown offers three lessons for investors and \norganizations. Some of the teachings may be familiar but are a useful reminder. \n \nLesson 1: Pay attention to the results of the past. Andrew Beyer, a horse racing expert, said of American \nPharoah\u2019s chances of winning: \u201cBased on recent history, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d Why the downbeat message? The \nanswer lies in the base rate of success over time. \n \nIn the last 100 years, 31 horses have been in a position to capture the Triple Crown and, as noted, 11 of \nthem succeeded. That places the success rate at about 35 percent. But those numbers belie a marked \ndistinction before and after 1950. Before 1950, eight of the nine horses that tried won, or close to 90 percent. \nSince 1950, only 3 of 22 have succeeded, and none since 1978. In the past sixty-five years, more than 85 \npercent of the horses failed to capture glory. \n \nFurther, American Pharoah\u2019s speed is not particularly distinguished. Beyer developed the Beyer Speed Figure, \nwhich measures the results of a horse adjusted for the track conditions. Higher speed figures are better. \nWhen you compare American Pharoah\u2019s figures for the Kentucky Derby and Preakness to those of the last \neight Triple Crown aspirants\u2014reliable speed figures have only been available since 1990\u2014he falls near the \nbottom of the heap. The sole horse with worse speed figures was last year\u2019s failed Triple Crown contender, \nCalifornia Chrome, who finished the Belmont tied for fourth place. \n \nIn 2014, California Chrome had to deal with 10 challengers, whereas American Pharoah will run against just 7. \nThat brightens American Pharoah\u2019s prospects. But winning the Belmont has eluded all comers in the last 36 \nyears. \n \nThe lesson is to consider base rates in assessing future outcomes. While finding an appropriate reference \nclass and the relevant data can be tricky, psychologists have shown that we tend to rely too much on our own \npoint of view and fail to consider sufficiently the experiences of others.  \n \nLesson 2: Recognize the value of diversity. In the discussion of success rates, the year 1950 pops off the \npage. Why would the horses have succeeded at such a high rate prior to 1950 and at such a low rate after it?  \n \nThe answer has many facets, but exhibit 1 is a good place to start. It shows the winning times for the three \nevents from 1950 to 2015 (of course, it is without the Belmont result). Rather than listing the races in \nchronological order, they are ranked by distance. The Preakness is the shortest race (1 3/16  miles), the \nKentucky Derby in the middle (1 1/4  ), and the Belmont the longest (1 1/2 ). \n \n"

For example, the winner of the 1950 \nKentucky Derby, Middleground, had a raw time of 2:01:60, faster than American Pharoah\u2019s 2:03:02 in 2015. \n \nOne academic studying the topic wrote, \u201cDespite intensive programs to breed faster thoroughbreds . . . race \nspeeds . . . have not increased in the last 40-60 years.\u201d3 Can you think of any other athletic endeavor where \nthe results have not improved since the middle of the last century? \n \nExhibit 1: Winning Times for Triple Crown Races, 1950-2015 \n  \n \n \nSource: www.preakness-stakes.info; www.kentuckyderby.ag; www.belmontstakes.com. \n01:52.32\n01:54.05\n01:55.78\n01:57.50\n01:59.23\n02:00.96\n02:02.69\n1950\n1955\n1960\n1965\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\nMinutes:Seconds\nPreakness Stakes\n01:58.37\n02:00.10\n02:01.82\n02:03.55\n02:05.28\n02:07.01\n1950\n1955\n1960\n1965\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\nMinutes:Seconds\nKentucky Derby\n02:23.42\n02:25.15\n02:26.88\n02:28.61\n02:30.34\n02:32.06\n02:33.79\n02:35.52\n1950\n1955\n1960\n1965\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nMinutes:Seconds\nBelmont Stakes\n"

      "text": " \n \nJune 4, 2015 \n \nTriple Crown Teachings \n4 \nTake humans as an example. Researchers estimate that winning times for elite humans running races from \nsprints to marathons have improved 12 to 13 percent over the same time period.4 You can explain this gain \nthrough a larger population, better nutrition, refined training methods, psychological incentives, and an \nimprovement in technology. (This leaves aside other potential sources of performance enhancement that are \nrelevant for animals and humans.) \n \nOne plausible explanation is that thoroughbred horses reached their physiological peak of performance in the \nmid-1900s.5 Breeding is a key part of this argument. In 1791, James Weatherby established a record of \nthoroughbred horse breeding, effectively creating a closed population. Analysis shows that about one-third of \nthe genes in the current population of one-half million thoroughbreds come from four stallions born between \n1688 and 1725. The top ten contributors are responsible for about half of the genes, and 31 horses account \nfor 80 percent of the genetic makeup of today\u2019s stock.6 Thoroughbreds have among the highest ratio of \ninbreeding of any horse breed.7   \n     \nEarly horse races tended to be over longer distances than today and owners ran horses that were older. In the \nlast two centuries, the distances have gotten shorter and the horses younger. As a result, thoroughbreds were \nbred for speed and precocity. This allowed for a steady improvement in race performance from the early \n1800s through the mid-1900s.8 But horses have simply not gotten faster, save for some improvement at short \ndistances. Since 1950, normal variance explains most of the ups and downs in times.9 \n \nIndeed, it appears that inbreeding has taken a turn for the worse in recent decades. Whereas the goal for \nyears had been to breed for speed, the emphasis today is more on producing yearlings that fetch as much \nmoney as possible at auction. As a result, inbreeding has increased sharply since the mid-1990s.10   \n \nThe lesson is to avoid the equivalent of inbreeding in your organization. Research shows that diverse teams \ntend to outperform more homogenous ones when faced with complex problems. Many organizations, including \ninvestment banks, consulting firms, and investment managers, tend to recruit from a select number of \nuniversities and place substantial weight on personal fit. This practice can limit diversity.11      \n \nThe goal is to build a workforce with high cognitive diversity and good cultural fit.12 You can think of the value \nof cognitive diversity as similar to that of genetic diversity. Matt Ridley, a journalist, makes the link even more \nvivid when he suggests that the key to innovation is \u201cideas having sex.\u201d13 The point is that you want diverse \nideas to engage in reproduction so as to increase the fitness of your organization. \n \nLesson 3: Value = Probability x Price. Notwithstanding the dismal record of horses trying to win the Triple \nCrown, bettors appear unfailingly optimistic about each horse\u2019s chances. Exhibit 2 shows that the last eight \ncontenders had probabilities of winning the Belmont in the range of 40 to 80 percent as implied by the odds.  \n \nExhibit 2: Implied Probability of Winning the Belmont for the Last Eight Triple Crown Aspirants \n \nSource: Equibase Company. \nProbability\nSilver Charm\n   49%\nReal Quiet\n56\nCharismatic\n39\nWar Emblem\n44\nFunny Cide\n50\nSmarty Jones\n74\nBig Brown\n77\nCalifornia Chrome\n63\n"

      "text": " \n \nJune 4, 2015 \n \nTriple Crown Teachings \n5 \nAmerican Pharoah is in the same range. The recent odds of 3-5 suggest a probability of winning of 63 \npercent. That figure is very high, representing a lofty expectation of performance. Odds are set through a pari-\nmutuel system, where the bettors express their expectations by how they allocate their dollars. More money \nbet on a horse drives up its probability of winning. \n \nSteven Crist, a handicapper and author, emphasizes that the attractiveness of an opportunity is a function of \nboth the probability of the event occurring and the payoff.14 Before any bettors are rewarded, there is a \ntakeout to pay the race purses, track, and state. This means that the win pool is reduced by 15-20 percent. \nAssume the takeout is 20 percent. That means a $4 bet on a horse with a 50 percent chance to win pays, on \naverage, $3.20.15   \n \nCrist\u2019s point is that the intelligent handicapper requires a combination of probability and price to yield a positive \nexpected value. Knowing which horse is likely to win doesn\u2019t make you money; you need to know which horse \nis mispriced. It takes little effort to translate this to the world of business and investing. Knowing which \ncompany is best isn\u2019t the path to riches; knowing which company is mispriced makes you money.  \n \nTriple Crown contenders attract a lot of unsophisticated bettors. On a typical Saturday in the U.S., wagers on \nhorses are about $50 million. For last year\u2019s Belmont Stakes, the bets were three times that amount. You can \nsafely assume that most of the incremental $100 million was from people caught up in the excitement of the \nTriple Crown.16 As a result, Triple Crown contenders are almost always mispriced. Probability times price yields \na poor value. Perhaps for some, betting on a potential winner has excitement value that exceeds the cost of \nthe ticket. But that doesn\u2019t make it a good bet in monetary terms. \n \nThe final lesson is that you need to focus on mispricing in investing. Triple Crown contenders are a little like \ndot-com darlings from the late 1990s: Their past success draws the attention of individuals who invest without \nsufficient regard to the relationship between price and value.   \n \nAmerican Pharoah may win the Triple Crown, and if he does it will be an extraordinary feat that will bring \ndeserved excitement to the sport. But no matter the outcome, we can say that his current probability appears \ntoo high. \n   \n \n"
