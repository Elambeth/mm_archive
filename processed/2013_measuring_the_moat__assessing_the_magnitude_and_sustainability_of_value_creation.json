      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n3 \n \n \nExecutive Summary  \n \n \n \uf402\n Sustainable value creation has two dimensions\u2014how much economic profit a company earns and how \nlong it can earn excess returns. Both dimensions are of prime interest to investors and corporate \nexecutives. \n \uf402\n Sustainable value creation as the result solely of managerial skill is rare. Competitive forces drive returns \ntoward the cost of capital. Investors should be careful about how much they pay for future value creation.   \n \uf402\n Warren Buffett consistently emphasizes that he wants to buy businesses with prospects for sustainable \nvalue creation. He suggests that buying a business is like buying a castle surrounded by a moat and that \nhe wants the moat to be deep and wide to fend off all competition. Economic moats are almost never \nstable. Because of competition, they are getting a little bit wider or narrower every day. This report \ndevelops a systematic framework to determine the size of a company\u2019s moat. \n \uf402\n Companies and investors use competitive strategy analysis for two very different purposes. Companies \ntry to generate returns above the cost of capital, while investors try to anticipate revisions in expectations \nfor financial performance. If a company\u2019s share price already captures its prospects for sustainable value \ncreation, investors should expect to earn a risk-adjusted market return. \n \uf402\n Industry effects are the most important in the sustainability of high performance and a close second in \nthe emergence of high performance. However, industry effects are much smaller than firm-specific \nfactors for low performers. For companies that are below average, strategies and resources explain  \n90 percent or more of their returns.  \n \uf402\n The industry is the correct place to start an analysis of sustainable value creation. We recommend getting \na lay of the land, which includes a grasp of the participants and how they interact, an analysis of profit \npools, and an assessment of industry stability. We follow this with an analysis of the five forces and a \ndiscussion of the disruptive innovation framework. \n \uf402\n A clear understanding of how a company creates shareholder value is core to understanding sustainable \nvalue creation. We define three broad sources of added value: production advantages, consumer \nadvantages, and external advantages. \n \uf402\n How firms interact plays an important role in shaping sustainable value creation. We consider interaction \nthrough game theory as well as co-evolution. \n \uf402\n Brands do not confer competitive advantage in and of themselves. Customers hire them to do a specific \njob. Brands that do those jobs reliably and cost effectively thrive. Brands only add value if they increase \ncustomer willingness to pay or if they reduce the cost to provide the good or service. \n \uf402\n We provide a complete checklist of questions to guide the strategic analysis in Appendix A. \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n4 \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nCorporate managers seek to allocate resources so as to generate attractive long-term returns on investment. \nInvestors search for stocks of companies that are mispriced relative to embedded financial expectations. In \nboth cases, sustainable value creation is of prime interest. \n \nWhat exactly is sustainable value creation? We can think of it in two dimensions. First is the magnitude of \nreturns in excess of the cost of capital that a company does, or will, generate. Magnitude considers not only \nthe return on investment but also how much a company can invest at a rate above the cost of capital. Growth \nonly creates value when a company generates returns on investment that exceed the cost of capital. \n \nThe second dimension of sustainable value creation is how long a company can earn returns in excess of the \ncost of capital. This concept is also known as fade rate, competitive advantage period (CAP), value growth \nduration, and T.1 Despite the unquestionable significance of the longevity dimension, researchers and \ninvestors give it insufficient attention. \n \nHow does sustainable value creation differ from the more popular notion of sustainable competitive \nadvantage? A company must have two characteristics to claim that it has a competitive advantage. The first is \nthat it must generate, or have an ability to generate, returns in excess of the cost of capital. Second, the \ncompany must earn an economic return that is higher than the average of its competitors.2 \n \nAs our focus is on sustainable value creation, we want to understand a company\u2019s economic performance \nrelative to the cost of capital, not relative to its competitors. Naturally, these concepts are closely linked. \nSustainable value creation is rare, and sustainable competitive advantage is even rarer. \n \nCompetitive Life Cycle \n \nWe can visualize sustainable value creation by looking at a company\u2019s competitive life cycle. (See Exhibit 1.) \nCompanies are generally in one of four phases: \n \uf402\n Innovation. Young companies typically see sharp increases in return on investment and significant \ninvestment opportunities. This is a period of rising returns and heavy investment. Companies are \ncommonly in this phase before they go public. There is also substantial entry into, and exit out of, the \nindustry at this point in the life cycle.   \n \uf402\n Fading returns. High returns attract competition, generally causing economic returns to move toward \nthe cost of capital. In this phase, companies still earn excess returns, but the return trajectory is down. \nInvestment needs also moderate, and the rate of entry and exit slows. \n \uf402\n Mature. In this phase, the market in which the companies compete approaches competitive equilibrium. \nAs a result, companies earn the cost of capital on average, and competition within the industry ensures \nthat aggregate returns are no higher. Investment needs continue to moderate. \n \uf402\n Subpar. Competitive forces and technological change can drive returns below the cost of capital, \nrequiring companies to restructure. These companies can improve returns by shedding assets, shifting \ntheir business model, reducing investment levels, or putting themselves up for sale. Alternatively, these \nfirms can file for bankruptcy in order to reorganize the business or liquidate the firm\u2019s assets.  \n \n"

There are two explanations for reversion to the mean in corporate \nperformance. The first is purely statistical. If the correlation between cash flow return on investment (CFROI) \nin two consecutive years is not perfect, there is reversion to the mean.  \n \nThink of it this way: there are aspects of running the business within management\u2019s control, including \nselecting the product markets it chooses to compete in, pricing, investment spending, and overall execution. \nCall that skill. There are also aspects of the business that are beyond management\u2019s control, such as \nmacroeconomic developments, customer reactions, and technological change. Call that luck. Whenever luck \ncontributes to outcomes, there is reversion to the mean. If year-to-year CFROIs are highly correlated, \nreversion to the mean happens slowly. If CFROIs are volatile, causing the correlation to be low, reversion to \nthe mean is rapid.  \n \nThe second explanation for reversion to the mean is that competition drives a company\u2019s return on investment \ntoward the opportunity cost of capital. This is based on microeconomic theory and is intuitive. The idea is that \ncompanies generating a high economic return will attract competitors willing to take a lesser, albeit still \nattractive, return. Ultimately, this process drives industry returns down to the opportunity cost of capital. \nResearchers have empirically documented this prediction.3 Companies must find a way to defy these powerful \ncompetitive forces in order to achieve sustainable value creation.  \n \nRecent research on the rate of mean reversion reveals some important observations. First, the time that an \naverage company can sustain excess returns is shrinking. This phenomenon is not relegated to high \ntechnology but is evident across a wide range of industries.4 This reduction in the period of sustained value \ncreation reflects the greater pace of innovation brought about in part by increased access to, and utilization of, \ninformation technology.  \n \nSecond, the absolute level of returns and the level of investment are positively related to the rate of fade.5 A \ncompany that generates high returns while investing heavily signals an attractive opportunity to both existing \nand potential competitors. Success sows the seeds of competition. \nIncreasing Returns\n& High Reinvestment\nAbove-Average\nbut Fading Returns\nBelow-Average\nReturns\nAverage\nReturns\nHigh Innovation\nFading Returns\nMature\nNeeds Restructuring\nEconomic\nReturn\nDiscount Rate\n(Required\nRate of Return)\nReinvestment\nRates\n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n6 \n \n \nWhy is sustainable value creation so important for investors? To start, investors pay for value creation. Exhibit \n2 looks at the S&P 500 since 1961 and provides a proxy for how much value creation investors have been \nwilling to pay for. We establish a steady-state value by capitalizing the last four quarters of operating net \nincome for the S&P 500 by an estimate of the cost of equity capital.6 We then attribute any value above the \nsteady-state to expected value creation. The exhibit shows that currently one-fifth of the value of the S&P \n500 reflects anticipated value creation, a low number compared to the last 50 years. Since 2010, the level of \nanticipated value creation has remained below the historical average of one-third, as earnings have recovered \nand interest rates have remained low.  \n \nExhibit 2: Rolling Four Quarter Anticipated Value Creation \n \nSource: Standard & Poor\u2019s, Aswath Damodaran, Credit Suisse. \nData as of June 30, 2013. \n \nMore significant, sustained value creation is an important source of expectations revisions. There is a crucial \ndistinction between product markets and capital markets. Companies try to understand the industry and \ncompetitive landscape in their product markets so as to allocate resources in a way that maximizes long-term \neconomic profit. Investors seek to understand whether today\u2019s price properly reflects the future and whether \nexpectations are likely to be revised up or down. \n \nSo companies and investors use competitive strategy analysis for two very different purposes. Companies try \nto generate returns above the cost of capital, while investors try to anticipate revisions in expectations. \nInvestors should anticipate earning a market return, adjusted for risk, if a company\u2019s share price already \ncaptures its prospects for sustainable value creation.7 \n \n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1961\n1963\n1965\n1967\n1969\n1971\n1973\n1975\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\nAnticipated Value Creation (%)\n2 standard deviations\n2 standard deviations\nAverage\nCurrent\n"

We are \nnot asking what determines a company\u2019s share price performance, which is a function of expectations \nrevisions, but rather its economic profitability.10 \n \nBefore we answer the question, we can make some empirical observations.

The question is in what proportion.11  \n \nAnita McGahan and Michael Porter, two prominent scholars of business strategy, analyzed roughly 58,000 \nfirm-year observations for U.S. businesses from 1981-1994.12 They assessed the impact of four factors on \nthe sustainability and emergence of abnormal profitability: \n \uf402\n Year. The year effect captures the economic cycle. You can think of it as the macroeconomic factors that \ninfluence all businesses in the economy.  \n \uf402\n Industry. Industry effects refer to how being part of a particular industry affects firm performance. A firm \nmay benefit from industry effects if the industry has an attractive structure, including high barriers to entry. \n \uf402\n Corporate-parent. A corporate-parent effect arises when a business within a diversified firm on average \nunderperforms or outperforms its industry. For example, the corporate-parent effect was positive for Taco \nBell, which saw its profitability improve in the 1980s following its acquisition by PepsiCo. \n \uf402\n Segment-specific. This effect captures the characteristics unique to a firm that drive its performance \nrelative to rivals within the same industry. Such characteristics may include a firm\u2019s resources, positioning, \nor how effectively its managers execute strategy. \n \nExhibit 5 summarizes McGahan and Porter\u2019s results. They define sustainability of profits as \u201cthe tendency of \nabnormally high or low profits to continue in subsequent periods.\u201d Emergence looks backward from the current \nyear and measures the contributions to abnormal profits through time. High performers are those companies \nthat generate profits in excess of the median of their industry, and low performers are those below the median. \n \nExhibit 5: Importance of Various Factors on Abnormal Profitability \n \nSource: Anita M. McGahan and Michael E. Porter, \u201cThe emergence and sustainability of abnormal profits,\u201d Strategic Organization, Vol. 1, No. 1, \nFebruary 2003, 79-108. \n \nMcGahan and Porter found that industry effects are most important in the sustainability of high performance \nand a close second in the emergence of high performance (just behind segment-specific effects). However, \nindustry effects are much smaller than segment-specific effects for low performers. The strategies and \nresources of below-average companies explain 90 percent or more of their returns in the case of either \nsustainability or emergence. Business managers and analysts searching for emerging or sustained competitive \nadvantages might also note that the economic cycle is not important to the sustainability or emergence of \nperformance. \n \nHigh Performers\nLow Performers\nHigh Performers\nLow Performers\nYear\n3%\n-7%\n2%\n-5%\nIndustry\n44%\n12%\n37%\n13%\nCorporate-parent\n19%\n-4%\n18%\n2%\nSegment-specific\n34%\n99%\n43%\n90%\nEmergence\nSustainability\n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n11 \n \n \nWe break the industry analysis into three parts: \n \n1. Get the lay of the land. This includes creating an industry map to understand the competitive set, \nconstructing profit pools to see whether (and why) the distribution of economic profits has changed over \ntime, measuring industry stability, and classifying the industry so as to improve alertness to the main \nissues and opportunities. \n \n2. Assess industry attractiveness through an analysis of the five forces. Of the five forces, we spend \nthe bulk of our time assessing barriers to entry and rivalry. \n \n3. Consider the likelihood of being disrupted by innovation. We consider the role of disruptive \ninnovation and why industries transition from vertical to horizontal integration. \n \nThe Lay of the Land \n \nIndustry Map \n \nCreating an industry map is a useful way to start competitive analysis.13 A map should include all the \ncompanies and constituents that might have an impact on a company\u2019s profitability. The goal of an industry \nmap is to understand the current and potential interactions that ultimately shape the sustainable value creation \nprospects for the whole industry as well as for the individual companies within the industry. \n \nFrom an industry point of view, you can think of three types of interactions: supplier (how much it will cost to \nget inputs), customer (how much someone is willing to pay for a good or service), and external (other factors \nthat come into play, such as government action). Exhibit 6 shows an illustration for the U.S. airline industry. \nClients can create industry maps, or \u201cpeer maps,\u201d for specific companies using Credit Suisse\u2019s RAVE tool. \nRAVE not only produces peer maps quickly and efficiently but also provides access to the models and \nforecasts of Credit Suisse analysts. \n \nHere are some points to bear in mind as you develop an industry map: \n \uf402\n List firms in order of dominance, typically defined as size or market share; \n \uf402\n Consider potential new entrants as well as existing players; \n \uf402\n Understand the nature of the economic interaction between the firms (e.g., incentives, payment terms); \n \uf402\n Evaluate any other factors that might influence profitability (e.g., labor, regulations). \n \nA study by Lauren Cohen and Andrea Frazzini, professors of finance, suggests that investors may benefit from \npaying close attention to industry maps. The researchers examined how shocks to one firm rippled through to \nother firms via supply or demand links. They tested whether the market adequately incorporated the \ninformation that one firm released into the stock prices of its partner firms. They found that investors fail to \nadequately incorporate such information, creating a profitable trading strategy.  \n \nCohen and Frazzini state that \u201cthe monthly strategy of buying firms whose customers had the most positive \nreturns in the previous month, and selling short firms whose customers had the most negative returns, yields \nabnormal returns of 1.55% per month, or an annualized return of 18.6% per year.\u201d14 \n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n13 \n \n \nProfit Pool \n \nThe next step is to construct a profit pool.15 A profit pool shows how an industry\u2019s value creation is distributed \nat a particular point in time. The horizontal axis is the percentage of the industry, typically measured as \ninvested capital or sales, and the vertical axis is a measure of economic profitability (e.g., CFROI minus the \ndiscount rate). As a result, the area of each rectangle\u2014the product of invested capital and economic return\u2014\nis the total value added for that sector or company. For example, a company that has $200 million of invested \ncapital and a spread of 5 percentage points between its CFROI and discount rate generates  \n$10 million in economic profit ($10 million = $200 million x .05). The total profit pool of the industry is the \nsum of the added value for all of the companies. \n \nTo understand the overall profitability of an industry, it is useful to analyze the average profitability over a full \nbusiness cycle, which is generally three to five years.16 But average profitability doesn\u2019t reveal how value has \nmigrated over time. Profit pools are particularly effective because they allow you to trace the increases or \ndecreases in the components of the value-added pie. One effective approach is to construct a profit pool for \ntoday, five years ago, and ten years ago and then compare the results over time.  \n \nExhibit 7 is a profit pool for the airlines industry.

This may not be a surprise for the legacy carriers, all of which have filed for \nbankruptcy over the past decade. But it is a surprise for the low-cost carriers, which are known for \nstandardized fleets, simpler route structures, and higher aircraft utilization.  \n \nCreating a narrative to explain the rise and fall of the various competitors can provide important clues about \nwhat it takes to sustain value creation. One trend that the profit pool analysis reveals is the market share gain \nfor the low-cost airlines at the expense of the legacy carriers. However, this has not translated into better \nrelative profitability. Southwest\u2019s returns, for example, have suffered as the company has expanded into pairs \nof cities that are less dense and as its average pay has risen to the highest in the industry.18 Despite the fact \nthat industry structure does not ordain a firm\u2019s profitability, it remains very challenging for any airline to escape \nthe industry\u2019s low barriers to entry, high fixed costs, excess capacity, and modest traffic growth.  \n \nIndustry Stability \n \nIndustry stability is another important metric. Generally speaking, stable industries are more conducive to \nsustainable value creation. Unstable industries present substantial competitive challenges and opportunities. \nThe value migration in unstable industries is greater than that of stable industries, making sustainable value \ncreation that much more elusive. \n \nWe can measure industry stability a couple of ways. One simple but useful proxy is the steadiness of market \nshare. This analysis looks at the absolute change in market share for the companies within an industry over \nsome period. (We typically use five years.) We then add up the absolute changes and divide the sum by the \nnumber of competitors. The lower the average absolute change in market share, the more stable the industry. \n \nExhibit 9 shows the market share stability for four industries. There is relative stability in soft drinks, while \npersonal computers and storage hardware show moderate change, and there is substantial change in the \nsmartphone market. Our rule of thumb is that absolute average changes of 2.0 or less over five years \nconstitute a stable industry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

But the industry does not seal the fate of its members. \nAn individual company can achieve superior profitability compared to the industry average by defending against \nthe competitive forces and shaping them to its advantage.21 \n \nExhibit 12: Michael Porter's Five Forces that Shape Industry Structure \n  \nSource: Michael E. Porter, Competitive Strategy (New York: The Free Press, 1980), 4. \n \nWhile analysts commonly treat Porter\u2019s five forces with equal emphasis, we believe that threat of entry and \nrivalry are so important that they warrant in-depth treatment. Further, our section on firm-specific analysis will \nput a finer point on some of the other forces. For now, here\u2019s a quick look at supplier power, buyer power, \nand substitution threat:22 \n \uf402\n Supplier power is the degree of leverage a supplier has with its customers in areas such as price, quality, \nand service. An industry that cannot pass on price increases from its powerful suppliers is destined to be \nunattractive. Suppliers are well positioned if they are more concentrated than the industry they sell to, if \nsubstitute products do not burden them, or if their products have significant switching costs. They are also \nin a good position if the industry they serve represents a relatively small percentage of their sales volume \nor if the product is critical to the buyer. Sellers of commodity goods to a concentrated number of buyers \nare in a much more difficult position than sellers of differentiated products to a diverse buyer base. \n \uf402\n Buyer power is the bargaining strength of the buyers of a product or service. It is a function of buyer \nconcentration, switching costs, levels of information, substitute products, and the offering\u2019s importance to \nBargaining power\nof suppliers\nThreat of\nnew entrants\nThreat of\nsubstitutes\nBargaining power\nof buyers\nRivalry among\nexisting firms\n"

Informed, large buyers have much more leverage over their suppliers than do uninformed, \ndiffused buyers. \n \uf402\n Substitution threat addresses the existence of substitute products or services, as well as the likelihood \nthat a potential buyer will switch to a substitute product. A business faces a substitution threat if its prices \nare not competitive and if comparable products are available from competitors. Substitute products limit \nthe prices that companies can charge, placing a ceiling on potential returns. \n \nThe threat of new entrants, or barriers to entry, is arguably the most important of Porter\u2019s five forces. Before \nwe delve into the factors that determine impediments to entry, it is worthwhile to review the empirical research \non entry and exit.  \n \nEntry and Exit \n \nExhibit 13 shows the rate of entry and exit for U.S. establishments across all industries since 1977, using the \nU.S. Census\u2019s Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS). Most studies on corporate demography use \nestablishments, a rough proxy for firms, as the unit of analysis because that is the way that the Census \nBureau collects and reports the data. Establishments are the physical sites where corporations operate, \nwhereas firms are the aggregations of all the establishments a parent company owns. Most firms, and \nespecially young ones, have only one establishment.23 \n \nA useful way to think about entry and exit is to imagine an industry with 100 firms today. Based on the \naverage annual rates over the past decade, within one year roughly 11 new firms will enter the industry and \n10 will leave. This brings the total number of firms to 101. Because entry rates typically exceed exit rates, the \nnumber of establishments in the United States has increased over time. \n \nExhibit 13: Establishment Entry and Exit Rates, 1977-2010 (United States) \n \nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies, Business Dynamics Statistics; Credit Suisse. \n \n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n1977\n1981\n1985\n1989\n1993\n1997\n2001\n2005\n2009\nEntry Rate\nExit Rate\n"

These \nrates vary widely based on where the industry is in its life cycle and on the industry\u2019s barriers to entry and exit. \nResearch shows that the number of firms in new industries follows a consistent path.  \n \nThe market is uncertain about the products it favors in the early stage of industry development, which \nencourages small and flexible firms to enter the industry and innovate. As the industry matures, the market \nselects the products it wants and demand stabilizes. The older firms benefit from economies of scale and \nentrenched advantages, causing a high rate of exit and a move toward a stable oligopoly.24 Exhibit 14 shows \nthe entry and exit rates for a variety of sectors, grouped according to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) \ncodes.  \n \nExhibit 14: Entry and Exit Rates by Sector, Annual Averages, 1977-2010 (United States) \n \nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies, Business Dynamics Statistics; Credit Suisse. \n \nThere is a strong correlation between the rate of entry and exit for each sector.

A typical entrant \nis only about one-third the size of an incumbent, with the exception of diversifying firms that build new \nplants.

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n22 \n \n \nLet\u2019s first look at the expectations of incumbent reaction to a potential new entry. Four specific factors \nindicate the likely ferocity of incumbent reaction: asset specificity, the level of the minimum efficient production \nscale, excess capacity, and incumbent reputation. \n \nFor a long time, economists thought that a firm\u2019s commitment to a market was a function of the magnitude of \nassets it had invested. More careful analysis revealed that it\u2019s not the quantity of assets that matters but rather \nthe degree to which those assets are specific to that market. A firm that has assets that are valuable only in a \nspecific market will fight hard to maintain its position. \n \nA clear illustration is a railroad versus an airline route. Say a company builds a railroad track from New York to \nChicago. It can use that asset for only one thing: to move a train back and forth between those two cities. As \na result, that company will go to great lengths to protect its position.29 Now consider an airline that flies from \nNew York to Chicago. If that route proves uneconomic, the airline can reroute the plane to a more attractive \ndestination. \n \nAsset specificity takes a number of forms, including site specificity, where a company locates assets next to a \ncustomer for efficiency; physical specificity, where a company tailors assets to a specific transaction; \ndedicated assets, where a company acquires assets to satisfy the needs of a particular buyer; and human \nspecificity, where a company develops the skills, knowledge, or know-how of its employees.30 \n \nThe next factor is production scale. For many industries, unit costs decline as output rises. But this only \noccurs up to a point. This is especially relevant for industries with high fixed costs. A firm enjoys economies of \nscale when its unit costs decline with volume gains. At some point, however, unit costs stop declining with \nincremental output and companies get to constant returns to scale. The minimum efficient scale of production \nis the smallest amount of volume a company must produce in order to minimize its unit costs. (See Exhibit \n16.) \n \nThe minimum efficient scale of production tells a potential entrant how much market share it must gain in \norder to price its goods competitively and make a profit. It also indicates the size of an entrant\u2019s upfront capital \ncommitment. When the minimum efficient scale of production is high relative to the size of the total market, a \npotential entrant is looking at the daunting prospect of pricing its product below average cost for some time to \nget to scale. The steeper the decline in the cost curve, the less likely the entry. The main way an entrant can \ntry to offset its production cost disadvantage is to differentiate its product, allowing it to charge a price \npremium versus the rest of the industry. \n \nMinimum efficient scale is generally associated with manufacturing businesses, including automobile and \nsemiconductor fabrication plants. But the concept applies to knowledge businesses as well, where a company \ncreates content once\u2014often at a very high cost\u2014and then replicates it for the market. Software development \nis a good example. Microsoft spent $6 billion to develop its Vista operating system. But once the company \nhad written the code, replicating and distributing the software was relatively inexpensive. So the same cost \ncurve exists and is very steep.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Oster, Modern Competitive Analysis (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 62. \n \nA third factor in weighing incumbent reaction is excess capacity. The logic here is quite straightforward. \nAssuming that demand remains stable, an entrant that comes into an industry that has too much capacity \nincreases the excess capacity of the incumbents. If the industry has economies of scale in production, the \ncost of idle capacity rises for the existing companies. As a result, the incumbents are motivated to maintain \ntheir market share. So the prospect of a new entrant will trigger a price drop. This prospect deters entry. \n \nThe final factor is incumbent reputation. Firms usually compete in various markets over time. As a \nconsequence, they gain reputations as being ready to fight at the least provocation or as being \naccommodating. A firm\u2019s reputation, backed by actions as well as words, can color an entrant\u2019s decision. \n \nAnother important shaper of barriers to entry is the magnitude of the entrant\u2019s anticipated payoff. An entrant \ncannot be sure that it will earn an attractive economic profit if the incumbent has an insurmountable \nadvantage. Incumbent advantages come in the form of precommitment contracts, licenses and patents, \nlearning curve benefits, and network effects. \n \nThe first incumbent advantage is precommitment contracts. Often, companies secure future business through \nlong-term contracts. These contracts can be efficient in reducing search costs for both the supplier and the \ncustomer. A strong incumbent with a contract in place discourages entry. \n \nPrecommitment contracts take a number of forms. One is if an incumbent has favorable access to an \nessential raw material. An example of this occurred shortly following World War II. Alcoa, an aluminum \nproducer, signed exclusive contracts with all of the producers of an essential material in aluminum production \ncalled high-grade bauxite. The inability to access bauxite on such favorable terms deterred potential entrants.  \n \nAnother form of precommitment contract is a long-term deal with customers. In the mid-1980s, Monsanto \n(NutraSweet) and Holland Sweetener Company were two producers of the sweetener aspartame. After the \npatent on aspartame expired in Europe in 1987, Holland entered the market to compete against Monsanto. \nThe competition drove down the price of aspartame 60 percent, and Holland lost money.  \n \nBut Holland had its eye on the real prize, the U.S. market, where the patent was to expire in 1992. In a classic \nprecommitment move, Monsanto signed long-term contracts to supply the largest buyers of aspartame, \nAverage\nCost\nCost per unit\nQ\nOutput\nMinimum\nEfficient\nScale\n"

This suggests a crucial lesson \nfor companies and investors: all buyers like to have multiple suppliers to choose from, but it doesn\u2019t mean that \nthey will use multiple suppliers. Holland created a great deal of value for Coke and Pepsi but none for itself.31 \n \nPrecommitment also includes quasi-contracts, such as a pledge to always provide a good or service at the \nlowest cost. Such pledges, if credible, deter entry because new entrants rarely have the scale to compete with \nincumbents.  \n \nLicenses and patents also shape a potential entrant\u2019s payoff for reasons that make common sense. A number \nof industries require a license or certification from the government to do business. Acquiring licenses or \ncertifications is costly, hence creating a barrier for an entrant. \n \nPatents are also an important entry barrier. But the spirit of a patent is different from that of a license. The \nintent of a patent is to allow an innovator to earn an appropriate return on investment. Most innovations require \nsubstantial upfront costs. So a free market system needs a means to compensate innovators to encourage \ntheir activities. Patents do not discourage innovation, but they do deter entry for a limited time into activities \nthat are protected. \n \nLearning curves can also serve as a barrier to entry. The learning curve refers to an ability to reduce unit costs \nas a function of cumulative experience. Researchers have studied the learning curve for hundreds of products. \nThe data show that, for the median firm, a doubling of cumulative output reduces unit costs by about  \n20 percent.32 A company can enjoy the benefits of the learning curve without capturing economies of scale, \nand vice versa. But generally the two go hand in hand. \n \nNetwork effects are another important incumbent advantage that can weigh on an entrant\u2019s payoff. Network \neffects exist when the value of a good or service increases as more members use that good or service. As an \nexample, eBay is attractive to users precisely because so many buyers and sellers congregate there. In a \nparticular business, positive feedback often ensures that one network becomes dominant: eBay has not only \nweathered competitive onslaughts but also strengthened its position. These winner-take-most markets deter \nentry.33  \n \nGood examples today are the online social networks, including Facebook and Twitter, which become more \nvaluable to a user as more people join. We also see network effects in the smartphone market between the \ndominant operating systems and application developers. Because the vast majority of users own devices \noperating on Android or iOS, application developers are far more likely to build applications for them than for \nother operating systems. This creates a powerful ecosystem that is daunting for aspiring entrants.34 \n \nThe last point, consistent with DRS\u2019s analysis of entry and exit, is the link between barriers to entry and \nbarriers to exit. High exit costs discourage entry. The magnitude of investment an entrant requires and the \nspecificity of the assets determine the size of exit barriers. Low investment needs and non-specific assets are \nconsistent with low barriers to entry. \n \nRobert Smiley, a retired economist who specialized in competitive strategy, surveyed product managers about \ntheir strategies to deter entry.35 While his analysis was limited to consumer products companies, the results \nare instructive nonetheless. (See Exhibit 17.) The first three strategies\u2014learning curve, advertising, and \nR&D/patents\u2014create high entry costs. The last three\u2014reputation, limit pricing, and excess capacity\u2014\ninfluence judgments of post-entry payoffs. Virtually all managers reported using one or more of these \nstrategies to deter entry. \n"

A pair of economists, Colin Camerer and \nDan Lovallo, designed an experiment to understand why subjects enter a game.36 When the scientists \ninformed the subjects that the payoffs were based on skill, the individuals overestimated their probability of \nsuccess. As a result, they entered the game at a higher rate than those who were told that the payoffs were \nrandom. Most subjects who entered the game believed they would have positive profits despite the negative \ntotal profit among all entrants.  \n \nThe researchers attributed the overconfidence of the entrants to \u201creference group neglect.\u201d The idea is that \nthe entrants focused on what they perceived to be their unique skills while ignoring the abilities of their \ncompetitors and the high failure rate of new entries (the reference group). The failure to consider a proper \nreference class pervades many of the forecasts we make.37 In the business world, reference class neglect \nshows up as unwarranted optimism for the length of time it takes to develop a new product, the chance that a \nmerger succeeds, and the likelihood of an investment portfolio outperforming the market.38  \n \nCompetitive Rivalry \n \nRivalry among firms addresses how fiercely companies compete with one another along dimensions such as \nprice, service, new product introductions, promotion, and advertising. In almost all industries, coordination in \nthese areas improves the collective economic profit of the firms. For example, competitors increase their \nprofits by coordinating their pricing. Of course, coordination must be tacit, not explicit.  \n \nThere is a tension between coordinating and cheating in most industries. A firm that cheats (e.g., lowers its \nprice) while other firms are coordinating stands to earn disproportionate profits. We can think of rivalry as \nunderstanding, for each firm, the trade-offs between coordination and cheating. Lots of coordination suggests \nlow rivalry and attractive economic returns. Intense rivalry makes it difficult for firms to generate high returns. \n \nCoordination is difficult if there are lots of competitors. In this case, each firm perceives itself to be a minor \nplayer and is more likely to think individualistically. Naturally, the flip side suggests that fewer firms leads to \nmore opportunity for coordination. Research shows that most cases of price fixing that the government \nprosecutes involve industries with fewer firms than average.39  \n \nA concentration ratio is a common way to measure the number and relative power of firms in an industry. The \nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a popular method to estimate industry concentration. The HHI considers \nnot only the number of firms but also the distribution of the sizes of firms.

In industries with several firms of similar size, \nrivalry tends to be intense.  \n \nExhibit 18 shows the HHI for 20 industries. Many economists characterize readings in excess of 1,800 as \nindustries with reduced rivalry. The index is equal to 10,000 times the sum of the squares of the market \nshares of the 50 largest firms in an industry. If there are fewer than 50 firms, the amount is summed for all \nfirms in the industry. For instance, for an industry with four companies and market shares of 40 percent,  \n30 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percent, the index would be 3,000.

Researchers have shown this to be the case. Two professors of finance, Kewei \nHou and David Robinson, examined industries for the years 1963-2001 and found that concentrated \nindustries earned above average profits and less concentrated industries earned below average profits.40  \n \nAnother influence of rivalry is firm homogeneity. Rivalry tends to be less intense in industries with companies \nthat have similar goals, incentive programs, ownership structures, and corporate philosophies. But in many \ninstances, competitors have very different objectives. For example, an industry may have companies that are \npublic, privately held, or owned by private equity firms. These competitors may have disparate financial \nobjectives, incentive structures, and time horizons. The strategies that companies within an industry pursue will \nreflect the heterogeneity of objectives.41      \n \nIndustry Group (Manufacturing)\nIndex\nBreakfast cereal\n2,425.5\nTire\n1,539.6\nAutomobile\n1,448.8\nFiber optic cable\n1,239.2\nSugar\n1,097.5\nSoft drink\n1,094.5\nSnack food\n1,984.1\nPaper mills\n673.4\nCoffee and tea\n763.1\nFootwear\n602.8\nSmall arms\n508.2\nMusical instrument\n404.6\nFrozen food\n304.8\nSporting and athletic goods\n253.4\nDairy product\n290.7\nTextile mills\n160.2\nComputer and electronic product\n136.6\nChemical\n114.0\nApparel\n44.0\nFabricated metal product\n9.0\n"

Specific assets encourage a company to stay in an industry even when \nconditions become trying because there is no alternative use for the assets. Assets include physical assets, \nsuch as railroad tracks, as well as intangible assets such as brands. \n \nDemand variability shapes coordination costs and hence has an influence on rivalry. When demand variability is \nhigh, companies have a difficult time coordinating internally and have little opportunity to effectively coordinate \nwith competitors. Variable demand is a particularly important consideration in industries with high fixed costs. \nIn these industries, companies often add too much capacity at points of peak demand. While companies use \nthis capacity at the peak, the capacity is massively excessive at the trough and spurs even more intense \ncompetition at the bottom of the cycle. The condition of variable demand and high fixed costs describes many \ncommodity industries, which is why their rivalry is so bitter and consistent excess economic returns are so rare. \n \nA final consideration in rivalry is industry growth. When the pie of potential excess economic profits grows, \ncompanies can create shareholder value without undermining their competitors. The game is not zero-sum. In \ncontrast, stagnant industries are zero-sum games, and the only way to increase value is to take it from others. \nSo a rise in rivalry often accompanies a decelerating industry growth rate. \n \nDisruption and Disintegration \n \nMost strategy frameworks focus primarily on figuring out which industries are attractive and which companies \nare well positioned. Clayton Christensen, a professor of management, developed a theory to explain why great \ncompanies fail and how companies succeed through innovation. Christensen wondered why it was common \nfor companies with substantial resources and smart management teams to lose to companies with simpler, \ncheaper, and inferior products. His theory of disruptive innovation explains that process. 42 \n \nChristensen starts by distinguishing between sustaining and disruptive innovations. Sustaining innovations \nfoster product improvement. They can be incremental, discontinuous, or even radical. But the main point is \nthat sustaining innovations operate within a defined value network\u2014the \u201ccontext within which a firm identifies \nand responds to customers\u2019 needs, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors, and strives for \nprofit.\u201d43  \n \nDisruptive innovations, by contrast, approach the same market but with a different value network. Consider \nbook selling as an example. The evolution from mom-and-pop bookstores to superstores was a clear \ninnovation, but the value network was the same. Amazon.com introduced a new value network when it started \nselling books online. It is common for disruptors to trade lower operating profit margins for high capital \nturnover in their bid to earn returns on invested capital in excess of the cost of capital.   \n \nChristensen distinguishes between the two types of disruptive innovation: low-end disruptions and new-market \ndisruptions. Low-end disruptors offer a product that already exists. For instance, when Southwest Airlines \nentered the airline industry, it provided limited flights with no frills at a very low cost. Southwest couldn\u2019t, and \ndidn\u2019t, compete with the large carriers.   \n \nA new-market disruption, on the other hand, competes initially against \u201cnon-consumption.\u201d44 It appeals to \ncustomers who previously did not buy or use a product because of a shortage of funds or skills. A new-market \ndisruptive product is cheap or simple enough to enable a new group to own and use it.  \n \nThe transistor radio, introduced in the 1950s, is an example of a new-market disruption. Manufacturers such \nas Sony targeted teenagers, a group who wanted to listen to music on their own but who couldn\u2019t afford \n"

Teenagers were so thrilled that they could listen to these pocket-sized radios away from their \nparents that they ignored the static and poor sound quality.45 \n \nDisruptive innovations initially appeal to relatively few customers who value features such as low price, smaller \nsize, or greater convenience. Christensen finds that these innovations generally underperform established \nproducts in the near term but are good enough for a segment of the market. \n \nExhibit 19 presents Christensen\u2019s model visually. The horizontal axis is time, and the vertical axis is product \nperformance. The shaded area represents customer needs and takes the shape of a distribution that includes \nlow-end, average, and high-end customers.   \n \nThe upward-sloping line at the top is the performance trajectory of sustaining innovations.

Christensen, The Innovator's Dilemma (Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 1997), xvi. \n \nOne of the key insights of the model is that innovations often improve at a faster rate than the market \ndemands. Established companies, through sustaining technologies, commonly provide customers with more \nthan they need or more than they are ultimately willing to pay for. When innovation drives performance for a \nsustaining technology past the needs of mainstream customers, the product is \u201covershot.\u201d Such markets \ntypically include customers who are unwilling to pay for new features and who don\u2019t use many of the features \nthat the products offer.  \n \nFurther, when the performance of a sustaining innovation exceeds the high end of the consumer\u2019s threshold, \nthe basis of competition shifts away from performance toward speed-to-market and delivery flexibility. For \ninstance, as the personal computer market became overshot in the 1990s, manufacturers focused on \nperformance, such as Compaq, lost to manufacturers with more efficient delivery models, such as Dell.  \nMainstream \nCustomer \nNeeds\nSustaining\nInnovation\nPerformance\nDisruptive\nInnovation\nTime\nMeet customer \nneeds at lower price\nOvershoot customer \nperformance needs\n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n29 \n \n \nThe trajectory of product improvement allows disruptive innovations to emerge because, even if they do not \nmeet the demands of users today, they become competitive tomorrow. Further, because disruptive innovations \nhave a lower cost structure, they end up squeezing the established producers. \n \nChristensen likes to use the example of the mini-mills versus integrated mills in the steel industry. Mini-mills \nmelt scrap steel, so they are a fraction of the size of the integrated mills that make steel in blast furnaces. \nBecause the integrated mills controlled the whole process, they started with the substantial advantage of \nproducing steel of high quality.  \n \nThe mini-mills launched their simpler and cheaper model in the 1970s. Their inferior quality initially limited \nthem to making rebar, the bars that reinforce concrete. This is the least expensive and least valuable market \nfor steel. Indeed, the profit margins for integrated mills improved after they left the market for rebar to the \nmini-mills. As Christensen says, \u201cIt felt good to get in and good to get out.\u201d  \n \nBut the good feeling didn\u2019t last long. Just as the theory predicts, the mini-mills rapidly improved their ability to \nmake better steel and started to compete in markets that had more value. That process continued over time \nuntil the mini-mills shouldered into the high end of the market and destroyed the profitability of the integrated \nmills.     \n \nA crucial point of Christensen\u2019s work is that passing over disruptive innovations may appear completely rational \nfor established companies. The reason is that disruptive products generally offer lower margins than \nestablished ones, operate in insignificant or emerging markets, and are not in demand by the company\u2019s most \nprofitable customers. As a result, companies that listen to their customers and practice conventional financial \ndiscipline are apt to disregard disruptive innovations. \n \nExhibit 20 summarizes Christensen\u2019s three categories of innovation, sustaining, low-end, and new-market,  \nand considers the customers they serve, the technology they utilize to attract customers, the business models \nthey employ, and the expected incumbent response to each. The incumbent response warrants specific \nattention. If a new competitor comes along with a sustaining innovation, incumbents are highly motivated to \ndefend their turf. Christensen suggests it is very rare to see an incumbent lose this battle to a challenger. \n \nFor low-end disruptions, the motivation of incumbents is generally to flee. This is what the integrated mills did. \nIn the short run, fleeing helps profit margins by encouraging the incumbent to focus on the most lucrative \nsegment of the market. In the long run, it provides resources for the disruptor to build capabilities that allow it \nto penetrate the mainstream market on a cost-effective basis.  \n \nIncumbents are typically content to ignore new-market disruptions. The example of the transistor radio shows \nwhy. Because the portable radios did not encroach on the base of the established tabletop radio customers, \nthe incumbent firms were motivated to disregard the new product. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n32 \n \n \nFirm-Specific Analysis \n \nCore to understanding sustainable value creation is a clear understanding of how a company creates \nshareholder value. A company\u2019s ability to create value is a function of the strategies it pursues, its interaction \nwith competitors, and how it deals with non-competitors.48 \n \nMuch of what companies discuss as strategy is not strategy at all. As Michael Porter emphasizes, strategy is \ndifferent than aspirations, more than a particular action, and distinct from vision or values. Further, Porter \ndifferentiates between operational effectiveness and strategic positioning. Operational effectiveness describes \nhow well a company does the same activity as others. Strategic positioning focuses on how a company\u2019s \nactivities differ from those of its competitors. And where there are differences, there are trade-offs.49     \n \nWe first provide a fundamental framework for value creation. We then consider the various ways a company \ncan add value. Finally, we delve into firm interaction using game theory and principles of co-evolution. \n \nA Framework for Added-Value Analysis \n \nAdam Brandenburger and Harborne Stuart, professors of strategy, offer a very concrete and sound definition \nof how a firm adds value.50 Their equation is simple: \n \nValue created = willingness-to-pay  \u2013  opportunity cost \n \nThe equation basically says that the value a company creates is the difference between what it gets for its \nproduct or service and what it costs to produce that product (including the opportunity cost of capital). \nUnderstanding what each of the terms means is fundamental to appreciating the equation. \n \nLet\u2019s start with willingness to pay. Imagine someone hands you a brand new tennis racket. Clearly, that is \ngood. Now imagine that the same person starts withdrawing money from your bank account in small \nincrements. The amount of money at which you are indifferent to having the racket or the cash is the definition \nof willingness to pay. If you can buy a product or service for less than your willingness to pay, you enjoy a \nconsumer surplus. \n \nThe flip side describes opportunity cost. A firm takes some resource from its supplier. Opportunity cost is the \ncash amount that makes the supplier perceive the new situation (cash) as equivalent to the old situation \n(resource).  \n \nBrandenburger and Stuart then go on to define four strategies to create more value: increase the willingness \nto pay of your customers; reduce the willingness to pay of the customers of your competitors; reduce the \nopportunity cost of your suppliers; and increase the opportunity cost of suppliers to your competitors. This \nframework also fits well with Porter\u2019s generic strategies to achieve competitive advantage\u2014low-cost producer \n(production advantage) and differentiation (consumer advantage). \n \nBrandenburger teamed up with his colleague Barry Nalebuff to create what they call a \u201cvalue net.\u201d51 We \npresent the value net slightly differently than the authors do, but the components and configuration are \nidentical. (See Exhibit 22.) On the left are the firm\u2019s suppliers. On the right are the firm\u2019s customers. Between \nthe suppliers and customers are the company, its competitors, and its complementors\u2014a term we will define \nin more detail. For now, the point is that companies beyond a firm\u2019s suppliers, customers, and competitors \ncan affect the amount of added value that it can capture. \n"

Nalebuff, Co-opetition (New York: Doubleday, 1996), 17. \n \nThe value net fits comfortably into Michael Porter\u2019s traditional analyses but adds an important element: \nstrategy is not only about risk and downside but also about opportunity and upside. Research in industrial \norganization emphasizes non-cooperative game theory, a reasonable approach for well-established industries \nnear product price equilibrium. But cooperative game theory recognizes that many industries are dynamic and \noffer opportunities to cooperate as well as to compete. \n \nThe Value Chain \n \nMichael Porter also developed value chain analysis, a powerful tool for identifying a company\u2019s sources of \ncompetitive advantage. The value chain is \u201cthe sequence of activities your company performs to design, \nproduce, sell, deliver, and support its products.\u201d52 (Exhibit 23 depicts a generic value chain.)

To create superior value, a company \nshould look for existing or potential ways to perform activities differently or to perform different activities. \nThis can come anywhere along the value chain, starting with product design and ending with post-sales \nservice. \n \uf402\n Identify the drivers of cost. Estimate as closely as possible the full costs associated with each activity. \nLook for existing or potential differences between the cost structure of the company and that of \ncompetitors. Pinpointing the specific drivers of a cost advantage or disadvantage can yield crucial insights. \nThis allows a manager to rethink how, or why, a company performs a particular activity. \n \nSources of Added Value \n \nThere are three broad sources of added value: production advantages, consumer advantages, and external \n(e.g., government) factors. Note that there is substantial overlap between this analysis and the industry \nanalysis, but here we focus on the firm. \n \nProduction Advantages \n \nFirms with production advantages create value by delivering products that have a larger spread between \nperceived consumer benefit and cost than their competitors, primarily by outperforming them on the cost side. \nWe distill production advantages into two parts: process and scale economies. \n \nHere are some issues to consider when determining whether a firm has a process advantage: \n \uf402\n Indivisibility. Economies of scale are particularly relevant for businesses with high fixed costs. One \nimportant determinant of fixed costs is indivisibility in the production process. Indivisibility means that a \ncompany can\u2019t scale its production costs below a minimum level even if output is low. The baking \nbusiness is an example. If a bakery wants to service a region, it must have a bakery, trucks, and drivers. \nThese parts are indivisible, and a firm must bear their cost no matter what bread demand looks like. At the \nsame time, if the trucks go from half empty to completely full, fixed costs don\u2019t change much. \n \uf402\n Complexity. Simple processes are easy to imitate and are unlikely to be a source of advantage. More \ncomplex processes, in contrast, require more know-how or coordination capabilities and can be a source \nof advantage. For instance, Procter & Gamble (P&G) reportedly spent eight years and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to develop Tide Pods, a unit-dose capsule form of laundry detergent. Much of the \nspending went toward a dedicated staff of technical professionals, testing on thousands of consumers, \nand hundreds of packaging and product sketches. The government granted P&G numerous patents on \ndetergent chemistry, the pod\u2019s casing, and the manufacturing process. Bob McDonald, P&G\u2019s CEO at \nthe time, demonstrated his confidence in the intellectual property when he said, \u201cI don't imagine that this \nis going to be able to be copied in any way that it will become a threat.\u201d 54 \n \uf402\n Rate of change in process cost.

For industries with \ndeclining process costs, the incumbent has learning curve advantages, while the challenger has the \nadvantage of potentially lower future costs. So the analysis must focus on the trade-off between learning \nadvantages and future cost advantages. \n \uf402\n Protection. Look for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and operating rights that protect a firm\u2019s process. \nResearch suggests that products with patent protection generate higher economic returns as a group than \nany single industry.55 \n \uf402\n Resource uniqueness.

Exhibit 24 illustrates the \ndistinction between supply- and demand-side scale economies. A firm creates value if it has a positive spread \nbetween its sales and costs, including opportunity costs.56 A firm can create more value by either reducing its \ncosts or increasing the price it receives. Evidence suggests that differences in customer willingness to pay \naccount for more of the profit variability among competitors than disparities in cost levels.57  \n \nThe well-known cost curve depicted in Exhibit 24 shows that, as a manufacturing company increases its \noutput, its marginal and average unit costs decline up to a point. This is classic increasing returns to scale, as \nthe company benefits from positive feedback on the supply side. It\u2019s all about lowering costs. However, \npositive feedback tends to dissipate for manufacturing companies because of bureaucracy, complexity, or \ninput scarcity. This generally happens at a level well before dominance: market shares in the industrial world \nrarely top 50 percent. Positive feedback on the demand side comes primarily from network effects, a point we \nwill develop further in our discussion of consumer advantages.  \n \nExhibit 24: Supply- versus Demand-Side Driven Scale Economies \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nOutput\nPrice\nUsers\nOutput\nOpportunity cost\nCost\nSupplier\u2019s share\nFirm\u2019s share\nBuyer\u2019s share\nTotal Value Created\nWillingness to Pay\nUsers\nSupply-Side\nDemand-Side\nWillingness to pay\nAverage Cost per Unit\n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n36 \n \n \nSome areas to consider when determining whether or not a company has supply-side scale advantages \ninclude: \n \uf402\n Distribution. Start by determining whether the firm has local, regional, or national distribution scale. We \nwould note that very few firms have national distribution scale. One good example is retailing. Wal-Mart \nbuilt its business in the 1970s and 1980s through regional distribution advantages. Most retailers have \nonly regional advantages and often fail to generate meaningful economic profits outside their core \nmarkets.  \n \nOne useful way to assess distribution strength is to look at the firm\u2019s operations and revenues on a map. \nFirms likely have some advantages where assets and revenue are clustered.58 \n \uf402\n Purchasing. Some firms can purchase raw materials at lower prices as the result of scale. For instance, \nHome Depot was able to add over 200 basis points to its gross margin in the late 1990s by lowering its \ncost of merchandising through product line reviews and increased procurement of imported products. \nHome Depot used its size to get the best possible price from its suppliers. Increasingly, large firms are \nlowering their supplier\u2019s opportunity cost by providing the supplier with better information about demand. \n \uf402\n Research and development. Economies of scope, related to economies of scale, exist when a \ncompany lowers its unit costs as it pursues a variety of activities. A significant example is research and \ndevelopment spillovers, where the ideas from one research project transfer to other projects. For example, \nPfizer sought a drug to treat hypertension, then thought it might treat angina, and then found an unusual \nside effect which led to the blockbuster drug, Viagra.59 Companies with diverse research portfolios can \noften find applications for their ideas more effectively than companies with smaller research portfolios.  \n \uf402\n Advertising. The advertising cost per consumer for a product is a function of the cost per consumer of \nsending the message and the reach. If the fixed costs in advertising (e.g., ad preparation, negotiating \nwith the broadcaster) are roughly the same for small and large companies, then large companies have an \nadvantage in cost per potential consumer because they can spread their costs over a much larger base. \n \nFor example, say both McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s have equally effective national advertising campaigns in \nthe United States. That McDonald\u2019s has roughly twice as many stores as Wendy\u2019s does means that \nMcDonald\u2019s advertising cost per store is lower. \n \nCompanies that enjoy economies of scale in their local geographic or product markets should also be aware of \nthe impact of globalization on their industries. Analysis by McKinsey, a consulting firm, suggests that about \none-third of all industries are global, one-third national, and one-third regional. (See Exhibit 25.) Their \nresearch also shows that industries are becoming increasingly global over time.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

First, companies enjoying economies of \nscale in their local markets often find it extremely challenging to replicate those advantages in new product or \ngeographic markets. Even Wal-Mart has struggled overseas, where competitors dominant in those regions \nenjoy cost advantages in areas such as advertising and distribution. Any institutional advantages Wal-Mart has \nin terms of efficiency or use of technology are offset by the local economies of scale its competitors have \nearned.  \n \nSecond, increasing globalization may undercut the advantages of economies of scale in some industries. This \nis tied to the idea that an industry leader can more easily maintain dominance in a market of restricted size. In \na restricted market, an upstart needs to capture a significant amount of market share to reach economies of \nscale, a challenge given it must wrestle share from the leader itself. But as an industry undergoes \nglobalization, economies of scale are actually easier to obtain for new competitors, as they no longer need to \ncapture a significant share of a local market.60 \n \nIf you believe a firm has a production advantage, think carefully about why its costs are lower than those of its \ncompetitors.

Firms with consumer advantages create \nvalue by delivering products that have a larger spread between perceived consumer benefit and cost than its \ncompetitors do. They do so primarily by outperforming competitors on the benefit side. \n \nHere are some common features of companies with consumer advantages: \n \uf402\n Habit and high horizontal differentiation. A product is \u201chorizontally differentiated\u201d when some \nconsumers prefer it to competing products. This source of advantage is particularly significant if \nconsumers use the product habitually. A product need not be unambiguously better than competing \nproducts; it just has to have features that some consumers find attractive. Soft drinks are an example. \nCompeting with Coca-Cola is hard because many consumers habitually drink Coke and are fiercely \nattached to the product.61 \n \uf402\n Experience goods. An experience good is a product that consumers can assess only when they\u2019ve tried \nit. Search goods, in contrast, are products that a consumer can easily assess at the time of purchase \n(e.g., hockey pucks or office furniture). With experience goods, a company can enjoy differentiation \nbased on image, reputation, or credibility. Experience goods are often technologically complex. \n \uf402\n Switching costs and customer lock-in. Customers must bear costs when they switch from one \nproduct to another. The magnitude of switching costs determines the degree to which a customer is \nlocked in. Sometimes switching costs are large and obvious (e.g., $100 million for a company to replace \nits network), and sometimes they\u2019re small but significant (e.g., $100 per customer for 1 million \ncustomers to switch insurance providers).  \n \nAn example of a product with high switching costs is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. In \naddition to the high initial cost for the license, a company implementing a new ERP system must also \nexpend a significant amount of internal resources for things such as user training and IT support. \nMoreover, because a company must customize an ERP system to its business processes, it makes it \neven more costly to switch providers. Exhibit 26 provides a breakdown of various forms of lock-in and \ntheir associated switching costs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

If more than one interactive network is competing for \ncustomers, the network that pulls ahead will benefit from positive feedback, leading to a winner-take-most \noutcome. So the dominant network not only gets the most users and the benefit of scale, but also the \nswitching costs for its customers rise as the network becomes larger. The classic example of this de facto \nstandard setting is Microsoft\u2019s personal computer operating system business. \n \nThe pattern of cumulative users of an interactive network follows an S-curve, similar to the diffusion of other \ninnovations. However, the S-curve tends to be steeper for interactive networks.62 The late Everett Rogers, a \nprominent sociologist, found that the plot of new adopters to a technology or network follows a normal \ndistribution. Judging the source and longevity of a company\u2019s added value is central to understanding the \nlikelihood of sustainable value creation. A number of companies, including AOL, MySpace, and Friendster, \nappeared to have built valuable networks only to see their value fizzle.   \n \nIf you believe a firm has a consumer advantage, consider why the consumer\u2019s willingness to pay is high and \nlikely to stay high. Consumer advantages generally appear in the form of high gross margins.  \n \nExhibit 28 allows us to see which companies have production or consumer advantages by disaggregating the \nsources of economic return on investment. (CFROI = CFROI Margin x Asset Turnover.) The vertical axis is \nasset turnover. Companies with a production advantage generally have high asset turnover. The horizontal axis \nis profit margin.

Game theory forces managers to put \nthemselves in the shoes of other companies rather than viewing competition solely from their own point of \nview. \n \nThe prisoner\u2019s dilemma is the classic example of two-person interaction in game theory.65 We can consider \nthe prisoner\u2019s dilemma in a business context by looking at a simple case of capacity addition. Say two \ncompetitors, A and B, are deciding whether to add capacity. If competitor A adds capacity and B doesn\u2019t, A \ngets an outsized payoff. (See the bottom left corner of Exhibit 29.) Likewise, if B adds capacity and A \ndoesn\u2019t, B gets the large payoff (top right corner). If neither expands, the total payoff for A and B is the \nhighest (top left corner). But if both add capacity, the total payoff is the lowest (bottom right corner). \n \nIf a company plays this game once, the optimal strategy is to add capacity. Consider the problem from the \npoint of view of company A. The expected payoff from adding capacity is higher than the expected value of \nnot expanding. The same logic applies from B\u2019s standpoint. So adding capacity gets the competitors to the \nNash equilibrium, the point where no competitor can gain by changing its strategy unilaterally.  \n \nExhibit 29: Capacity Addition and the Prisoner's Dilemma \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nYou might assume that companies always evaluate the potential reactions of their competitors. But that is \nfrequently not the case. During a roundtable discussion in the mid-1990s, for instance, the chief financial \nofficer of International Paper revealed that his company considered basic economic conditions when weighing \nthe decision to build a new paper facility. But he conceded the absence of a game theoretic approach: \u201cWhat \nwe never seem to factor in, however, is the response of our competitors. Who else is going to build a plant or \nmachine at the same time?\u201d66 \n \nPankaj Ghemawat, a professor of strategy, provides a more sophisticated example based on the actual pricing \nstudy of a major pharmaceutical company.67 The situation is that a challenger is readying to launch a \nA\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB\n35\n35\n25\n40\n40\n25\n30\n30\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor A\nDon\u2019t Expand\nAdd Capacity\nDon\u2019t Expand\nAdd Capacity\n"

For example, \nwith no price change for the incumbent and very low pricing by the challenger, the model suggests a payoff of \n350 for the incumbent and 190 for the challenger (upper left corner). This analysis allowed the incumbent\u2019s \nmanagement to view the situation from the challenger\u2019s point of view versus considering only what it hoped \nthe challenger would do. \n \nExhibit 30: The Payoff Matrix in the Face of a Challenger Product Launch \n \nSource: Adapted from Pankaj Ghemawat, Strategy and the Business Landscape-3rd Ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 2009), 71. \n \nIn our simple cases of capacity additions and product launches, we treated competitor interaction as if it were \na one-time event. In reality, companies interact with one another all the time. So the next level of analysis \nconsiders repeated games. \n \nRobert Axelrod, a political scientist, ran a tournament to see which strategy was most successful in an iterated \nprisoner\u2019s dilemma. Instead of playing just once, the competitors played 200 rounds of the game with payoffs \nsimilar to that in Exhibit 29.68 The winning strategy was tit for tat. Tit for tat starts by cooperating but then \nmimics its competitor\u2019s last move. So if a competitor cuts price, a company employing tit for tat would cut \nprice as well. If the competitor then raises prices, tit for tat immediately follows. In practice, tit for tat is \neffective only if companies can judge clearly the intentions of their competitors. \n \nGame theory is particularly useful in considering pricing strategies and capacity additions.69 A thorough review \nof a firm\u2019s pricing actions and capacity additions and reductions can provide important insight into rivalry and \nrationality. You can do similar analysis at the industry level. Institutional memory, especially for cyclical \nbusinesses, appears too short to distinguish between a one-time and an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game.  \n \nCompanies and analysts can go beyond a payoff matrix that considers only one-time interaction and build a \ntree based on sequential actions. The approach here is similar to strategy in chess: look forward and reason \nbackward.70 \n \nExhibit 31 is an example of a game tree that Pankaj Ghemawat developed to reflect the payoffs from various \ndecisions in the early days of the satellite radio industry when two companies, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM \nC\nI\n190\n350\nC\nI\n163\n418\nC\nI\n155\n454\nC\nI\n50\n428\nC\nI\n168\n507\nC\nI\n168\n507\nC\nI\n138\n511\nC\nI\n124\n504\nC\nI\n129\n585\nC\nI\n126\n636\nC\nI\n129\n585\nC\nI\n116\n624\nC\nI\n128\n669\nNo price change\nC has large price \nadvantage\nC has small price \nadvantage\nI neutralizes C\u2019s \nadvantage\nIncumbent (I) \nPrice\nChallenger (C) Price\nVery Low\nLow\nModerate\nHigh\n"

So a brand is clearly not sufficient to ensure that a \ncompany earns economic profits, much less sustainable economic profits. \n \nExhibit 33: Brand Popularity Does Not Translate into Value Creation \n \nSource: Interbrand, Credit Suisse HOLT; Note: Returns data for financial companies represented by cash flow return on equity minus cost of equity.  \n \nOne way to think about brands is to consider what job a consumer is \u201chiring\u201d a product or service to do.74 \nCompanies tend to structure their target markets by product category or by customer characteristics. But \nconsumers don\u2019t buy something just because the average consumer in their demographic is supposed to like \nit. Instead, they find that they need something to get done, and they hire a product to do the job. A company \ncan differentiate itself, and build a more enduring brand, if it truly understands the job customers want done \nand develops its products or services accordingly. A brand, then, represents a product or service that is \neffective at getting a job done.   \n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\nCoca-Cola\nApple\nIBM\nGoogle\nMicrosoft\nGeneral Electric\nMcDonald's\nIntel\nSamsung\nToyota\nMercedes (Daimler)\nBMW\nDisney\nCisco\nHewlett-Packard\nGillette (Procter & Gamble)\nLouis Vuitton (LVMH)\nOracle\nNokia\nAmazon\nHonda\nPepsi\nHennes & Mauritz\nAmerican Express\nSAP\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\nCFROI minus Discount Rate (%)\nRank\nBest Global Brands, 2012\n"

A \nbrand that represents a business benefiting from network effects or that confers horizontal differentiation may \nincrease a customer\u2019s willingness to pay. Google, for instance, benefits from the company\u2019s network effects \nand adds value to the constituents in its ecosystem. The willingness to pay for a brand is high if you are in the \nhabit of using it, have an emotional connection to it, trust it, or believe that it confers social status.   \n \nIt is less common for brands to add value by reducing supplier opportunity cost. A fledgling supplier may try to \nland a prestigious company, even at a discounted price, as part of its effort to establish credibility. To the \ndegree that a brand plays a role in the perception of prestige or credibility, it can reduce supplier opportunity \ncost and hence increase added value for the branded company. \n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n48 \n \n \nManagement Skill and Luck \n \nManagerial skill entails creating a strategy and executing it effectively. But while better strategies will lead to \nmore successes over time, a good process provides no guarantee of a good outcome. In the highly complex \nenvironment in which companies compete, randomness, or luck, also greatly influences outcomes. \nCustomers, competitors, and technological change all contribute to uncertainty in decisions. This suggests \nthat outsiders should evaluate management teams and the strategies they devise based on the processes they \nemploy rather than the outcomes they achieve.75  \n \nThere are numerous books that purport to guide management toward success. Most of the research in these \nbooks follows a common method: find successful businesses, identify the common practices of those \nbusinesses, and recommend that the manager imitate them. Perhaps the best known book of this genre is \nGood to Great by Jim Collins. He analyzed thousands of companies and selected 11 that experienced an \nimprovement from good to great results. He then identified the common attributes that he believed caused \nthose companies to improve and recommended that other companies embrace those attributes.76 Among the \ntraits were leadership, people, focus, and discipline. While Collins certainly has good intentions, the trouble is \nthat causality is not clear in these examples. Because performance always depends on both skill and luck, a \ngiven strategy will succeed only part of the time.  \n \nJerker Denrell, a professor of behavioral science, discusses two crucial ideas for anyone who is serious about \nassessing strategy. The first is the undersampling of failure. By sampling only past winners, studies of \nbusiness success fail to answer a critical question: How many of the companies that adopted a particular \nstrategy actually succeeded?77  \n \nLet\u2019s say two companies, A and B, pursue the same strategy and that A succeeds while B fails. A\u2019s financial \nperformance will look great, while B will die, dropping out of the sample. If we only draw our observations from \nthe outcome rather than the strategy, we will only see company A. And because we generally associate \nsuccess with skill, we will assume that company A\u2019s favorable outcome was the result of skillful strategy. \nNaturally, by considering company B\u2019s results as well, we have a better sense of the virtue of the strategy. To \ncounter this effect, Denrell recommends evaluating all of the companies that pursue a particular strategy so as \nto see both successes and failures. \n \nDenrell\u2019s second idea is that it may be difficult to learn from superior performance.78 The notion is that \nsuperior corporate performance is frequently the result of a cumulative process that benefitted from luck. Said \ndifferently, if you were to rewind the tape of time and play it again, the same companies would not succeed \nevery time. Since some high-performing companies succeed by dint of luck, there is very little to learn from \nthem. Indeed, companies with good financial performance that compete in industries where cumulative \nprocesses are less pronounced may provide better lessons into the sources of success. \n \nFrustrated by a dearth of rigorous studies on business success, Michael Raynor and Mumtaz Ahmed, \nconsultants at Deloitte, teamed up with Andrew Henderson, a professor of management, to do a statistical \nstudy to determine which companies achieved levels of superior performance for a sufficient time to \nconfidently rule out luck. The researchers studied more than 25,000 U.S. publicly traded companies from \n1966 to 2010 and used quantile regression to rank them according to their relative performance on return on \nassets (ROA). (Bryant Matthews, who manages HOLT Model Development, replicated their process and \nfound very similar results.) \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nJuly 22, 2013  \nMeasuring the Moat \n49 \n \n \nThis analysis, which controlled for extraneous factors such as survivor bias, company size, and financial \nleverage, allowed them to understand the empirical parameters of past corporate performance. They then \nweeded out the instances of high performance that were due to randomness in order to find truly great \ncompanies. The bad news is that a large percentage of above average corporate performance is attributable to \nluck. The good news is that some companies truly are exceptional performers. Their analysis yielded a sample \nof 344 such companies.79  \n \nRaynor and Ahmed used their model to see whether the firms hailed as exemplary performers in popular \nbooks on business success were likely simply the beneficiaries of luck. The authors examined 699 companies \nfeatured in 19 popular books on high performance and tested them to see how many were truly great. Of the \ncompanies that they were able to categorize, just 12 percent met their criteria.80 \n \nIn an earlier paper they wrote, \u201cOur results show that it is easy to be fooled by randomness, and we suspect \nthat a number of the firms that are identified as sustained superior performers based on 5-year or 10-year \nwindows may be random walkers rather than the possessors of exceptional resources.\u201d81  \n \nOnce the researchers identified their sample of truly skillful companies, they did what other authors of the \n\u201csuccess study\u201d genre do: they studied the strategies of those superior companies for common patterns that \nmight prove useful to business executives trying to replicate such sustained success. \n \nThey divided the skillful companies into two groups according to the performance threshold they crossed often \nenough to rule out luck: Miracle Workers (top 10 percent of ROA), which consisted of 174 companies, and \nLong Runners (top 20-40 percent of ROA), which consisted of 170 companies. They labeled the final group \nAverage Joes. \n \nBy identifying a sample of truly superior companies, the authors were able to study the behaviors that \nappeared to be behind their performance advantages. They couldn\u2019t find any commonalities when they looked \nat specific actions but made a breakthrough when they examined the general manner in which these \ncompanies thought. The manner was highly consistent and fit with a generic differentiation strategy. Raynor \nand Ahmed argue that, when considering business decisions, the skillful companies acted as if they followed \ntwo essential rules:  \n \n1. Better before cheaper: compete on differentiators other than price. \n \n2. Revenue before cost: prioritize increasing revenue over reducing costs. \n \nBased on this analysis, they suggest two steps for managers. The first is to gain a clear sense of a company\u2019s \ncompetitive position and profit formula. Following this step, a company should understand clearly the \ncomposition of its returns (return on assets = return on sales x total asset turnover) and its relative competitive \nposition. Companies often compare their current financial performance to the past rather than to that of \ncompetitors. Business is a game of relative, not absolute, performance.   \n \nThe second step is to make resource allocation decisions consistent with the rules. So when faced with a \nchoice between offering a product or service with a low price and minimal standards versus a higher price and \nsuperior benefits, such as a great brand or superior convenience, executives should opt for the latter. Or a \ncompany should prefer a merger that realizes the opportunity to expand versus one that simply achieves \neconomies of scale.    \n \n"

But value creation itself is no assurance of superior stock price performance if the market fully \nanticipates that value creation. \n \nThe expectations investing process has three parts:82 \n \n1.

However, the vertical axis, which shows economic returns, tells a very different \nstory. While returns have fallen for pharmaceuticals and fluctuated for biotech, they have been stable for \nproviders & services and equipment & supplies, indicating that the latter segments are capturing a much \ngreater share of the value pie within the overall sector.  \n \nWe can demonstrate this with some simple calculations. By summing the area of each of the blocks, we find \nthat the total value pie for the sector was roughly $65 billion in 2002, $116 billion in 2007, and $118 billion in \n2012. The pharmaceutical industry saw its share of that pie fall from roughly two-thirds in 2002 to about \ntwo-fifths in 2012, while the combined share of providers & services and equipment & supplies rose from \nabout one-third to one-half. By examining these current shifts in the profit pool and by anticipating potential \nfuture changes, pharmaceutical companies can adjust their business models to try to capture a greater share \nof future industry profits.
