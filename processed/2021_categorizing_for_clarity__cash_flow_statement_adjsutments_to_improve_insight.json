A \ncompany spends money on investments that are expected to \ngenerate good returns relative to the capital\u2019s opportunity cost. It \nthen sells a good or service to customers that generates revenues \nand incurs expenses. The difference between revenues and costs \nis operating income, and after financing costs and taxes a company \nis left with net income. When income exceeds investments, the \ncompany generates cash that it can return to the capital providers. \nWhen investments exceed income, the company has to raise \ncapital, usually by issuing debt or equity. \nThe objective of financial statements is to help investors, creditors, \nand other interested parties understand the business. Financial \nstatements are intended to be relevant and to have predictive \nvalue.1 In standard finance, discounted cash flow (DCF) models \nare based on free cash flow, the difference between net operating \nprofit after taxes (NOPAT) and investment in future growth. The \nanalyst projects cash flows and then discounts them to estimate \ntoday\u2019s value.  \nPublic companies are required to disclose an income statement, a \nbalance sheet, and a statement of cash flows. The income \nstatement starts with revenue and shows the costs and expenses \nthat lead to net income for a given period. The balance sheet \nprovides a snapshot of a company\u2019s assets as well as the liabilities \nand equity used to finance them.  \nThe statement of cash flows classifies cash inflows and cash \noutflows into three categories: cash flow from operating activities, \ncash flow from investing activities, and cash flow from financing \nactivities. The sum of the three categories reconciles a company\u2019s \ncash and cash equivalents from one period to the next. The \nstatement of cash flows is a relatively recent accounting statement, \nhaving been required in its current form only since 1988.2 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n6112950 Exp. 11/30/2024 \n2 \n \nMost financial statement analysis is focused on the income statement and balance sheet, and the statement of \ncash flows is often treated as \u201can after-thought.\u201d3 But the statement of cash flows appears to match the basic \nactivities of a business. Cash flow from investing activities tells you how much money the company spent to \ngenerate future growth. Cash flow from operating activities goes beyond net income to reveal the cash in and \nout associated with activities based on the customer. And cash flow from financing reveals how the company \naddresses gaps between the cash flows associated with investments and operations.  \nA company is in a position to return cash to capital providers when the operations generate more cash than \ninvestment needs. When investment needs exceed cash from the operations, the company must raise capital \nto plug the gap. To be clear, negative free cash flow is not only fine but desirable when the return on investment \nis attractive.4  \nThe point of this report is that today\u2019s accounting creates a huge gap between financial statements and what an \ninvestor needs to understand a business. This is despite the conceptual match between categories on the \nstatement of cash flows and how businesses work.  \nWe will show how moving certain items from one category to another improves relevance without affecting the \nessential task of cash reconciliation.5 A clearer understanding of the cash in, cash out, and financing activities \nprovides relevance and predictive value beyond the current standards. This analysis is important because an \naccurate measure of the magnitude of investment and profitability is essential to understanding the business. \nWe use Amazon as our case study, but the analysis is relevant for nearly all companies. We limit the discussion \nto historical numbers to illustrate the concepts without implying anything about future results or the stock price. \nThe main takeaway is that Amazon\u2019s cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities \nare both substantially higher than what the company reports based on accepted accounting principles. \nThe definition of free cash flow that investors and companies commonly use is cash from operating activities \nminus capital expenditures.6 This is inconsistent with finance theory and can be a very misleading heuristic. To \nAmazon\u2019s credit, they provide multiple definitions of free cash flow. The company starts with the popular one but \nincludes alternative calculations that better reflect the magnitude of investment. Our adjustments do not change \na company\u2019s free cash flow, properly defined, but do change the composition.7  \nAdjustments to Improve Insight \nWe suggest moving the location of stock-based compensation (SBC), leases, and intangible investments within \nthe statement of cash flow. Removing the purchases and sales of marketable securities from investing activities \nmay also be appropriate.  \nStock-based compensation. Using equity to pay employees is relatively new. As recently as the mid-1980s, \nfewer than one-half of the chief executive officers (CEOs) of publicly-traded companies in the United States were \npaid in stock or stock options. By 2000, equity was about two-thirds of the median annual pay for CEOs.8 We \ncan attribute this large shift to a number of factors. First, the median percentage direct ownership of stock by \nCEOs of the top 120 public companies in the U.S. was 8 times higher in 1938 than it was in 1988. The amount \nof skin in the game for CEOs had been trending lower for decades.9 \nA vibrant market for corporate control arose in the 1980s, encouraging many boards to try to reduce agency \ncosts by aligning the interests of executives and shareholders. Paying with equity helped with this alignment. \n"

For example, for the 10 \nyears ended in 1997, total shareholder returns were positive for each of the top 100 companies in the U.S. That \nmeans that all CEOs who had SBC made money, even if their relative performance was poor.10  \nFinally, for a long time SBC did not show up as an expense on the income statement. Not until 2006 was \nexpensing compulsory under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The details of employee \nstock options were disclosed in the footnotes, but that an obvious expense was not included in the calculation \nof earnings encouraged their profligate use.  \nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) clearly believed that employee stock options were a cost \nthat should be on the income statement. But accounting firms and companies, especially in the technology \nindustry, lobbied heavily against including the expense. The misguided reasoning was that lower earnings would \ntranslate into lower stock prices. Dennis Beresford, then chairman of the FASB, recalls: \u201cPeople said to me, \u2018If \nwe have to record a reduction in income by 40%, our stock will go down by 40%, our options will be worthless, \nwe won't be able to keep employees. It would destroy all American business and Western civilization.\u2019\u201d11 \nAcademic research shows that these concerns came to naught.12     \nBut even as the issue of expensing SBC on the income statement has long been resolved, accountants still add \nback SBC expense in the calculation of cash flow from operations. SBC is a legitimate expense that should not \nbe reversed.13 Small companies, which generally have fewer financial resources than large ones do, rely heavily \non SBC. Employees provide both a source of financing and a service. \nExhibit 1 shows SBC as a percentage of sales for companies in the Russell 1000 Index based on size. The \nindex is the top thousand companies in the U.S. measured by market capitalization. The ratio of SBC to sales is \nabout 15 percent for the smallest companies and declines steadily to about 1 percent for the largest companies. \nFurther, SBC is strongly correlated with intangible investment.14 \nExhibit 1: Stock-Based Compensation as a Percentage of Sales by Size, Russell 1000, 2020 \n \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Russell 1000 as of 12/31/20; Data for calendar year 2020; Companies with minimum sales of $10 million. \n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n<0.75\n0.75-1.25\n1.25-2\n2-3\n3-4.5\n4.5-6.5\n6.5-10\n10-15\n15-30\n>30\nStock-Based Compensation \nas a Percentage of Sales\nSales, Latest Fiscal Year ($ Billions)\n-1 Standard Deviation\nMean\n+1 Standard Deviation\n"

All rights reserved. \n6112950 Exp. 11/30/2024 \n4 \n \nYou can think of SBC as one number that reflects two transactions.15 The company first sells shares (financing) \nand then uses the proceeds to pay employees (compensation for service). Combine these ideas and it makes \nsense to move SBC from the cash flow from operating activities section to the cash flow from financing activities \nsection. This portrays the cash flow statement more accurately.  \nAmazon\u2019s SBC was $9.2 billion in 2020, or 14 percent of its cash flow from operating activities and 30 percent \nof its primary measure of free cash flow, cash flow from operating activities minus net purchases of property and \nequipment. Reclassifying their SBC reduces that measure of free cash flow from $31.0 billion to $21.8 billion.  \nExhibit 2 shows median and aggregate SBC as a percentage of cash flow from operating activities for sectors \nin the Russell 1000. SBC was most significant for technology companies. For this sector, the median ratio of \nSBC to cash flow from operating activities was 25 percent and the aggregate was 15 percent. \nExhibit 2: Median and Aggregate Stock-Based Compensation Relative to Cash Flow from \nOperating Activities for Sectors, Russell 1000, 2020 \nSector \nMedian \nAggregate \nInformation Technology \n25.0% \n14.7% \nHealth Care \n8.1% \n6.4% \nConsumer Discretionary \n5.1% \n8.2% \nIndustrials \n4.7% \n8.0% \nEnergy \n4.5% \n5.2% \nConsumer Staples \n3.4% \n3.5% \nTelecommunication Services \n3.1% \n4.4% \nMaterials \n2.9% \n2.6% \nUtilities \n1.6% \n2.0% \nTotal \n5.7% \n8.6% \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Russell 1000 excluding financial and real estate sectors as of 12/31/20; Data for calendar year 2020. \nThis discussion has no bearing on the merits of SBC. Using stock for compensation can make sense because \nit provides a source of capital and aligns the interests of employees and shareholders. The crucial point is to \nthink of SBC properly in the context of how a business creates value. \n \nLeases. A company that invests in a physical asset can generally buy it or lease it. A lease is a contract by \nwhich the lessor agrees to allow the lessee the use of an asset for a specific period in return for a periodic \npayment. For example, say you are at an airline and are in charge of acquiring aircraft. You would analyze the \npros and cons of a purchase versus a lease and select the one that makes the most sense financially. Airlines \nin fact buy and lease, as do many companies making the investments required to create value.  \nInvestors need to understand the magnitude of investment. The problem is that the assets a company purchases \nshow up in cash flow from investing activities, while assets that are leased are reflected in cash flow from \nfinancing activities. The adjustment here is to move the property and equipment acquired with leases into the \nsection that captures cash flow from investing activities. \nFor Amazon, $10.7 billion moves from the financing to the investing category, taking the company\u2019s cash flow \nfrom investing activities from an outflow of $59.6 billion to an outflow of $70.3 billion, an 18 percent increase. It \nalso reduces the company\u2019s secondary definition of free cash flow, cash flow from operating activities minus net \n"

Remove the SBC addback and free cash flow drops to $11.1 billion.  \nTo be clear, Amazon adheres to all accounting standards and provides this modified definition of free cash flow. \nThey specifically disclose that, \u201cIn this measure [of free cash flow], property and equipment acquired under \ncapital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased for cash.\u201d16 \nWhile we focus here on capturing the large adjustment from the financing to the investing sections, further \nmodifications are necessary to properly calculate net operating profit after taxes in order to build an unlevered \ndiscounted cash flow model.17    \nIntangible Investments. The most significant adjustment deals with intangible investments. An investment is \nan outlay today with the expectation of an attractive return based on the present value of future cash flows. Until \nthe 1990s, tangible investments exceeded intangible ones. Further, the basic structure of financial statements \nwas developed to reflect a world of tangible assets and has not changed much in a century.18   \nCompanies now invest much more in intangible assets than in tangible assets.19 Intangible assets are not \nphysical and include employee training, brand building, and software code. Tangible assets are physical, such \nas factories, airplanes, and machines. We estimate that companies in the Russell 3000 made $1.8 trillion in \nintangible investments in 2020 and spent $900 billion on capital expenditures.20   \nAccountants record most intangible investments on the income statement. The essential adjustment is to move \nintangible investment from cash flow from operating activities, where it is hidden, to cash flow from investing \nactivities.  \nThe analytical challenge is to separate selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses into what is an \ninvestment and what is necessary to maintain the business. In recent years, academics have developed \ntechniques to do this. The split between discretionary and maintenance SG&A spending is different based on \nthe industry and the company.21   \nWe use these techniques to estimate Amazon\u2019s investment in intangible assets. We assume that fulfillment \ncosts, about 45 percent of total SG&A, are linked to current sales and hence have no investment component. \nThese are predominately the expenses to operate fulfillment centers, stores, and customer service centers.  \nEstimating intangible investment for the remaining SG&A requires two significant assumptions: the percentage \nof an expense item that is deemed an investment and the appropriate amortization period. We designate three-\nquarters of technology and content expense, one-half of marketing expense, and one-fifth of general and \nadministrative expense as investment in intangible assets. This suggests that 62 percent of eligible SG&A, and \n34 percent of total SG&A, are discretionary investments. Exhibit 3 shows the relevant components of SG&A in \n2020 multiplied by the percent allocated to intangible investment.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

First, net income increases by $19.0 billion, \nthe $44.4 billion of intangible investment minus the $25.4 billion in amortization. Second, depreciation and \namortization rises by $25.4 billion.

The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 specifies where particular \ncash receipts and cash payments are classified within the statement of cash flows. It notes that cash outflows \nfrom investing activities include payments \u201cto acquire debt instruments of other entities (other than cash \nequivalents)\u201d and \u201cto acquire equity instruments of other enterprises.\u201d22  \nThe standard also says that a \u201cstatement of cash flows shall explain the change during the period in cash and \ncash equivalents\u201d where cash equivalents are \u201cshort-term, highly liquid investments\u201d with original maturities of \nthree months or less.  \nThe analytical question is whether Amazon\u2019s marketable securities should be treated as a cash equivalent. This \nissue is also relevant for other large companies that are rich in cash. The reasoning is that marketable securities \nare straightforward to value, non-essential to operations, and designated as current assets, which means they \nare expected to be converted to cash within a year. \nAn analyst who concludes that marketable securities and cash are equivalent can remove the purchases and \nsales of marketable securities from the cash flows from investing activities. The statement of cash flows would \nthen explain the change during the period to reconcile cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.  \nExhibit 6 shows this additional adjustment for Amazon. As compared to exhibit 5, adjusted cash flow from \noperating activities is unchanged at $101.2 billion as is the adjusted cash flow from financing activities of $18.8 \nbillion. But now the revised cash flow from investing activities goes from an adjusted -$114.7 billion to -$92.5 \nbillion. This is the result of reclassifying the net purchase of $22.2 billion of marketable securities in 2020 as a \ncomponent of the change in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.  \nWe believe that this adjustment is more open to debate than the other ones but makes sense for certain \nbusinesses, including Amazon. \nImpact on Traditional Multiples \nFree cash flow, properly defined as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus investment in future growth \n(I). NOPAT and I are both appropriately adjusted up by $19.0 billion. Free cash flow is unchanged, but the path \nto get there is markedly different than without the adjustments.  \nWhile free cash flow is unaffected, traditional measures of income change dramatically. As a result, common \nvaluation methods based on multiples can be very misleading. One example is enterprise value-to-earnings \nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA). Enterprise value is the sum of the market \nvalue of the company\u2019s debt and equity minus excess cash. At year-end 2020, Amazon\u2019s enterprise value was \njust under $1.7 trillion and its 2020 EBITDA was $48.2 billion, for an EV/EBITDA multiple of 35.0.  \nThese adjustments add $44.4 billion to EBITDA ($19.0 billion to EBIT and $25.4 billion to DA), more than a 90 \npercent increase from the unmodified sum. As a result, the EV/EBITDA multiple falls to 18.2. If these adjustments \nmake economic sense, the EV/EBITDA multiple is off by a factor of nearly two. \n \n \n \n \n"

The investment analyst and academic \ncommunities tend to focus on the income statement and balance sheet. The statement of cash flows, required \nin the U.S. only since the late 1980s, documents the cash flows from operations, investing, and financing that \ncan provide insight into how a business works. \nThe challenge is that the accounting has not kept pace with the economics. As a result, we suggest three \nadjustments within the statement of cash flows to better categorize activities. The first is stock-based \ncompensation. Accounting standards prescribe adding back this expense to cash flow from operating activities, \nbut it is better classified as equity financing and therefore should be in cash flow from financing activities. \nA company making a physical investment commonly has a choice between purchasing or leasing the asset. It \nis an investment in either case, but a purchase and a lease show up in different parts of the statement of cash \nflows. We recommend reflecting all of these expenditures in cash flow from investing activities. \nThere has been a dramatic change in the nature of investment for companies, from tangible to intangible assets, \nin recent decades. Accountants place tangible investments on the balance sheet, as they have done for \ncenturies. But investments in intangible assets are typically expensed on the income statement. This means that \nearnings and investments are understated absent any adjustments. \nThe proper measurement of the magnitude and useful life of intangible assets is a fast-growing area of research. \nOur estimates suggest that intangible investments by public companies in the U.S. are more than twice those of \ntangible investments. The central issues are which items within selling, general, and administrative expenses \nare reasonably considered discretionary investments, and the length of time over which those investments \nshould be amortized once capitalized on the balance sheet. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6112950 Exp. 11/30/2024 \n11 \n \nA final potential adjustment is to consider marketable securities as part of cash and cash equivalents. This \naffects cash flow from investing activities and means that the statement of cash flows is reconciling larger \nbeginning and ending sums.   \nWe shared a case study of Amazon for 2020 in an effort to make the concepts more concrete. The adjustments \nchange the portrayal of the company\u2019s finances, including a 53 percent boost in cash flow from operations and \na 92 percent increase in outflows associated with cash flow from investing activities. Excluding net purchases \nof marketable securities, the adjusted cash flow from investing activities still shows a 55 percent gain relative to \nthe unadjusted one. \nWe believe these adjustments substantially improve the description of a business. But we would add that free \ncash flow, defined properly, does not change at all. The main payoff from reclassifying items is a better \nappreciation of the cash flows in and out of the company. \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 14-16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

In 1863, Northern Central Railroad summarized its cash \ntransactions in an early version of a cash flow statement. In 1902, U.S. Steel provided a reconciliation of its \ncurrent \nassets \nminus \naccounts \npayable, \na \nrough \nproxy \nfor \nworking \ncapital. \n(See \nhttps://digital.case.edu/islandora/object/ksl%3Auniann00.) In 1971, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) \nissued Opinion 19, which required a funds statement. In 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) \nreleased Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 to supersede Opinion 19. It specified a cash flow \nstatement be included in financial reports. There are two noteworthy points about FAS No. 95. First, it \nencouraged companies to use the \u201cdirect method,\u201d which starts the section on cash flows from operations with \nreceivables from customers, relative to the \u201cindirect method,\u201d which starts the section with net income. Nearly \nall companies use the indirect method today. Second, there was substantial dissension on the FASB board, \nwhich is noted in the release. For a more complete discussion see, Geoffrey Poitras, \u201cHistory of the Cash Flow \nStatement\u201d at www.sfu.ca/~poitras/cash-flow-stmt-history.pdf. For a broader discussion of the history of \naccounting, see Gary John Previts and Barbara Dubis Merino, A History of Accountancy in the United States: \nThe Cultural Significance of Accounting (Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Pres, 1998).  \n3 Allen G. Arnold, R. Barry Ellis, V. Sivarama Krishnan, \u201cToward Effective Use of the Statement of Cash Flows,\u201d \nJournal of Business and Behavioral Sciences, Vol. 30, No. 2, Fall 2018, 46-62. \n4 As we have discussed before, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. had negative free cash flow each year from 1972-1986. \nIts annual total shareholder return was 18 percentage points higher than that of the S&P 500 during that period. \n5 For example, see the corporate performance statement in Alfred Rappaport, \u201cThe Economics of Short-Term \nPerformance Obsession,\u201d Financial Analysts Journal, Vol. 61, No. 3, May/June 2005, 65-79.  \n6 Katharine Adame, Jennifer Koski, Katie Lem, and Sarah McVay, \u201cFree Cash Flow Disclosure in Earnings \nAnnouncements,\u201d Working Paper, June 3, 2020. For example, see Paul Roche and Sid Tandon, \u201cSaaS and the \nRule of 40: Keys to the Critical Value Creation Metric,\u201d McKinsey & Company, August 3, 2021. \n7 The standard definition of free cash flow in finance is net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus investment \nin future growth. NOPAT equals earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) plus amortization of acquired \nintangibles assets minus cash taxes. Cash taxes reflect the tax provision, deferred taxes, and the tax shield. As \nsuch, NOPAT is the unlevered cash earnings of a company. Investment in future growth includes changes in \nworking capital, capital expenditures net of depreciation, and acquisitions net of divestitures. Two components \nof investment are reflected in cash flow from operating activities: depreciation and amortization and changes in \nworking capital. In Amazon\u2019s case, changes in working capital have historically been a source of cash because \nthe company receives cash from its customers sooner than it pays its suppliers. (To be more formal, the company \nhas a negative cash conversion cycle.) In effect, working capital has been a source of financing for the company. \nThis is not unique to Amazon but is an important consideration in assessing investment, profit, and financing.   \n8 Brian J.

After the FASB \nupdated its standards for Lease (Topic 842) accounting, which most companies had to implement by early 2019, \ncompanies capitalize operating leases but still expense lease costs. The result is a mismatch that needs to be \ncorrected.  \nConsistent with the discussion in the body, think of an airline buying a plane and financing it with debt. The \ncompany records the plane as an asset and the debt as a liability. It would then subtract interest expense, a \nfinancing cost, from operating income. Now consider a lease of the plane. Per the updated standard, the plane \nwould show up on the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. But the airline records the lease cost as an \noperating, rather than a financing, expense. This means that to calculate net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) \ncorrectly, you need to reclassify the embedded interest portion of the lease cost from the operating section of \nthe income statement to the financing section. This is only for U.S. GAAP, as the International Accounting \nStandards Board (IASB) properly treats the depreciation and interest expense components of operating lease \npayments. See Matthew A. Stallings, \u201cThe Potential Impact of Lease Accounting on Equity Valuation: \nImplications of Cost of Capital and Free Cash Flow Estimates,\u201d CPA Journal, Vol. 87, No. 11, November 2017, \n52-56. \n18 Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting and the Path Forward for Investors and Managers (Hoboken, \nNJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2016). For the case against capitalizing intangible investments, see Stephen Penman, \nAccounting for Value (New York: Columbia Business School Publishing, 2011). Penman writes,  \n\u201cThis view [that accounting is remiss if it does not get the balance sheet right] is shared by those who maintain \nthat accounting fails by not putting intangible assets on the balance sheet. They ask: How can accountants leave \nimportant assets off the balance sheet, assets such as a firm\u2019s \u2018knowledge capital,\u2019 its \u2018human capital,\u2019 the \norganizational capital\u2019 in its customer and supply-chain relationships, and its R&D assets? Why in the \n\u2018information age\u2019 do we still have a balance sheet more suited for the \u2018industrial age\u2019 when value came primarily \nfrom tangible assets rather than intangible assets? Let\u2019s get value back on the balance sheet! \nThis is an alluring proposal. The fundamentalist, of course, shudders. He or she see the term \u2018intangible asset,\u2019 \nas an excuse for speculation, for putting water on the balance sheet. . . . Anyone drilled in the methods of \naccounting for value sees the fallacy in the notion that the balance sheet is remiss if it does not indicate asset \nvalues; there is also an income statement and accounting for value employs both the income statement and the \nbalance sheet. If value is missing from book value, it can be plugged with earnings from the income statement.\u201d \n(179-180). \n19 For example, see Carol A. Corrado, Charles Hulten, and Daniel Sichel, \u201cMeasuring Capital and Technology: \nAn Expanded Framework,\u201d in Carol A. Corrado, John Haltiwanger, and Daniel Sichel, eds.
