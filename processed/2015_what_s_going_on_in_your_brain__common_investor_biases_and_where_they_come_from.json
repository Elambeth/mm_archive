      "text": " \n \nOctober 20, 2015 \nWhat\u2019s Going On in Your Brain? \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nIn recent decades, psychologists and economists have cataloged the ways in which human behavior deviates \nfrom economic theory.1 They have done this mostly through experiments and observation. Daniel Kahneman \nand Amos Tversky, psychologists who formalized this research, showed that individuals use heuristics, or rules \nof thumb, to make their judgments. These heuristics lead to biases when compared to normative economic \nbehavior.2 For example, people generally place too much weight on information that is available to their minds, \noften associated with an event that is vivid or recent, and overestimate the probability of a similar event \noccurring again.  \n \nNeuroscientists have joined psychologists and economists to create the field of neuroeconomics. One of the \ngoals of neuroeconomics is to understand how certain behaviors are linked to specific brain activity. The theory \nof modularity says that particular cognitive functions are associated with different parts of the brain. \nNeuroeconomics allows researchers to connect behaviors to specific regions, providing insight into how the \nbrain handles certain cognitive challenges.  \n \nIn this report, we examine four situations where individuals make poor choices and review the research to \nshow where the brain makes those decisions. In each case, we present some ideas about how to overcome \nthe potentially suboptimal choice. \n \nMental Mistake #1: Social Conformity        \n \nIn the summer of 2015, the CFA Institute surveyed 724 investors about which behavioral biases affect \ndecision making the most.3 More than one-third of the investors voted for herding, or \u201cbeing influenced by \npeers to follow trends.\u201d Herding is problematic because an investor can\u2019t beat his or her peers by doing the \nexact same thing that they are doing. Further, herding can lead to inefficient market prices.4 \n \nHumans are social beings, and conformity makes sense in a wide range of contexts. For example, you are \nwell served to do what others are doing when they know more than you do. Conformity also encourages \nothers to like you, which can confer loyalty and safety. Problems arise, however, when the group is wrong. \n \nSolomon Asch conducted the most famous experiment of social conformity in the 1940s and 1950s.5 The \nresearcher showed two cards to the subjects, who were in groups of seven to nine. One card had a single line \non it and the other had three lines of varying lengths, including one of the same length as that on the first card \n(see Exhibit 1). The task was to choose the line of the same length. Going around the room, the participants \nanswered one after the other. The experiment opened uneventfully as the group selected with near perfect \naccuracy.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Asch, \u201cOpinions and Social Pressure,\u201d Scientific American, Vol. 193, No. 5, November 1955, 31-35. \n \nThe experiment then started for real. Asch had arranged for all of the members except one to be in with him \non the experiment, making that individual the true subject. The researchers instructed the confederates, who \nanswered publicly before the true subject, to give the wrong response in two-thirds of the trials. In a set of \n123 experiments, the subjects conformed to the majority\u2019s wrong answer 36.8 percent of the time. While \nabout one-quarter of the subjects remained completely independent throughout the experiment, one-third \naligned with the majority most of the time. \n \nAsch was fascinated by this degree of social conformity and interviewed the subjects immediately following the \nexperiment. Based on their responses, he surmised that three \u201cdistortions\u201d could explain the behavior of the \nconformers.6  \n \nDistortion of judgment is a case when the subject concludes that the group knows more than he does and \nhence conforms. \u201cThese subjects,\u201d wrote Asch, \u201csuffer from primary doubt.\u201d  \n \nDistortion of action captures instances when the subject knows the right answer but feels more comfortable \nbeing part of the crowd but wrong. According to Asch, \u201cThey yield because of an overmastering need not to \nappear different.\u201d  \n \nDistortion of perception occurs when the subjects are unaware \u201cthat their estimates have been displaced or \ndistorted by the majority.\u201d In other words, the majority\u2019s answer changes how they perceive the answer. He \nadded that perception is the least popular explanation for conformity. \n \nWhile Asch\u2019s curiosity was laudable, interviews are not a rigorous way to determine the source of social \nconformity. In the mid-2000s, neuroscientists picked up where Asch left off. They were able to use functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to pinpoint the mechanisms of social conformity within the \nbrain.  \n \nFirst, scientists have been able to replicate Asch\u2019s results consistently.7 Subjects conform not only for \nperceptual tasks, such as identifying line lengths, but also for subjective evaluations including judging the \nquality of paintings. There is even some evidence another species, chimpanzees, conforms.     \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nOctober 20, 2015 \nWhat\u2019s Going On in Your Brain? \n4 \nOne of the earliest studies of social conformity using fMRI provided a startling result.8 Dr. Greg Berns and his \ncolleagues, using a perceptual task, showed that social conformity is consistent with activity in the occipital \nand parietal lobes\u2014visual processing regions associated with perception. More directly, the research suggests \nthat the social setting alters what the subjects perceive. This is consistent with Asch\u2019s distortion of perception.   \n \nFurther, those subjects who remained independent showed increased activity in the amygdala. This is a part of \nthe brain that decodes emotion and is especially attuned to threats. Various stimuli trigger activity in the \namygdala, but fear is the most effective. Staying independent creates an emotional burden and requires \novercoming a wave of fear. \n \nAdditional research supports the finding of Dr. Berns and his collaborators but overall the evidence remains \ntantalizing but tenuous.9 Multiple studies show that social conformity is associated with activity in the posterior \nmedial frontal cortex. This is the part of your brain that detects errors and interacts with other parts of the \nbrain to correct the error.10 Your brain notices when the group provides an answer that is different from yours, \nand that disparity is unpleasant. For many, aligning with the group is more rewarding for the brain than being \nindependent and correct.   \n \nThis research also provides some hints about how to avoid inappropriate conformity. The studies, starting with \nAsch, show that having someone in the group with the same view as you substantially reduces the pull of \nconformity. Seek others who are like-minded if you feel as if everyone has a point of view that is both different \nfrom yours and wrong. \n \nPerhaps the best advice comes from the father of security analysis, Benjamin Graham. He said, \u201cHave the \ncourage of your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know \nyour judgment is sound, act on it\u2014even though others may hesitate or differ. (You are neither right nor wrong \nbecause the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.)\u201d11   \n \nMental Mistake #2: Pattern Seeking        \n \nHumans are natural pattern seekers. This ability has conferred an advantage to Homo sapiens throughout our \nhistory. But problems arise when we perceive patterns where none exist, more formally what statisticians call \nType I error.  \n \nResearch shows that our desire to discern patterns, even when they are an incorrect assessment of cause \nand effect, has contributed to our evolutionary success. Essentially, evolution forgives lots of Type I errors as \nlong as the occasional correct assessment carries a sufficiently large benefit.12  \n \nThe use of a chart to divine a stock\u2019s next move is a good example of pattern seeking.13 While there may be \nvalue in technical analysis, there is not much in the way that most investors use past prices to understand the \nfuture. We are naturally drawn to imposing order, even to cases where the underlying processes are random. \n \nNeuroscientists have created some ingenious experiments to figure out what part of our brain is determined to \nsee patterns. But before we get to humans, let\u2019s start with pigeons. \n \nScientists set up a box with two keys that a pigeon can peck with payoffs that are random. They then make \none key much more attractive than the other\u2014for example, the red key provides food with an 80 percent \nprobability and the white key with a 20 percent probability (1 - .80). How will the pigeons choose? \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nOctober 20, 2015 \nWhat\u2019s Going On in Your Brain? \n5 \nOnce the pigeons figure out the relative probabilities, they maximize their payoff by hitting the red key almost \nevery time. Rats do this as well, as do children under the age of four.14 If the total possible payoff is 100, this \nstrategy yields 80 ([1.0 * 80] + [0.0 * 20]), and there is no strategy that can yield more.       \n \nHumans, on the other hand, tend follow a strategy called \u201cfrequency matching.\u201d After ascertaining the \nprobabilities, humans alternate between the red and white keys in an attempt to anticipate what will happen \nnext. They seek a pattern. They do guess red 80 percent of the time, matching the frequency of the payoffs, \nbut still try to anticipate the rewards even when they know the occurrences are random. This strategy has a \ntotal payoff of just 68 ([0.8 * 80] + [0.2 * 20]).  \n \nFrom kindergarten on, humans are frequency matchers. In recent decades, neuroscientists have been able to \nfigure out where this process happens in the brain through the study of split-brain patients. These are people \nwho have surgery to sever the bundle of nerves between the two hemispheres of the brain to treat epilepsy. \nThe surgery alleviates the symptoms of the disease and also allows scientists to determine which part of the \nbrain handles various tasks. Specifically, experiments with the split-brain patients allowed researchers to \ndiscern where the tendency to search for patterns resides.  \n \nThe right hemisphere is good at some tasks, including facial recognition, but is poor at making inferences. It \ntends to be literal. The left hemisphere, where language largely resides, is also good at inventing stories to fit \nfacts\u2014indeed, it may be too good at it.  \n \nWhen the scientists presented a version of the probability guessing experiment to the right hemisphere, they \nfound that it maximized just as the pigeons, rats, and little kids did. But when they did the same experiment \nwith the left hemisphere, they found it attempted to match frequency.15 The left hemisphere is the part of your \nbrain responsible for finding patterns. The scientists conclude \u201cthat the left hemisphere does this even when it \ncan be nonadaptive.\u201d16  \n \nOne investor behavior that appears consistent with pattern seeking is called the \u201cdumb money effect,\u201d where \ninvestors \u201ctend to transfer money from funds with low recent returns to funds with high recent returns.\u201d17 On \naverage, investors in mutual funds earn 1.5 percentage points less per year than a buy-and-hold strategy as a \nresult of the dumb money effect. The effect is even larger, 3 to 7 percentage points, in hedge funds.18  \n \nSo it\u2019s crucial to be aware that part of your brain is seeking patterns and will see them even when they don\u2019t \nexist. Distinguish between realms where patterns are likely to be useful and where they are generally illusory. \nThe behavior of investors and executives suggests that they believe they see dependable patterns even in \ncases when those patterns don\u2019t exist.  \n \nMental Mistake #3: Hyperbolic Discounting\u2014Preferring a Small Gain Today to a Larger \nGain Tomorrow         \n \nHere\u2019s a quiz for you: Which would you prefer, $10 today or $11 tomorrow? How about a choice between \n$10 one year from now and $11 in one year and a day? When researchers ask these questions, subjects \ngenerally prefer the lower amount now (\u201cI\u2019ll take the $10 today\u201d) and the higher amount in the future (\u201cI\u2019ll pick \nthe $11 in a year and a day\u201d).

For example, if your annual \ndiscount rate is 8 percent you are equally happy to receive $100 today or $108 one year from now. While \neconomists have known all along that people don\u2019t behave this way, it has become the standard in economic \ntheory. This is called exponential discounting.19 \n \nEconomists and psychologists can use the answers of their subjects to impute the discount rates that are \nconsistent with their choices.

      "text": " \n \nOctober 20, 2015 \nWhat\u2019s Going On in Your Brain? \n7 \nThe distinction between exponential and hyperbolic discounting may appear to be the purview of nerdy \nprofessors, but it actually has some important practical implications. We can start with a commonplace \nexample: a diet. Most of us decide at some point that it would be healthy to shed some weight. And most of \nus choose to eat a delicious dessert today and resolve to start the diet tomorrow. If this sounds familiar, you \nare not alone.       \n \nHere\u2019s a case in point. Researchers were interested in the choices people make for their snacks. The subjects \nhave a healthy choice, a piece of fruit, and an unhealthy choice, either a chocolate bar or a salty snack. A \nconsistent pattern emerges. When the scientists ask the subjects what they want now, they pick the \nunhealthy snack 70 percent of the time. But when the subjects are asked about a snack for next week, they \nselect the healthy one 74 percent of the time. We insist that our future selves will be good even as our \npresent selves enjoy some candy.21 \n \nConsidering which discount rate to apply also has major implications for policy decisions. For instance, \neconomists have come to very different conclusions about the cost of climate change, and hence the \nimmediate action necessary, based on the discount rate they assume. A low discount rate implies a high cost \nand a higher discount rate suggests a lower cost. Two economists who agree on the costs and risks of \nclimate change might come to very different conclusions about necessary policy based solely on the interest \nrate assumption.22 \n \nFinally, many individuals make financial decisions that are not optimal. One illustration is the age at which U.S. \ncitizens should claim Social Security benefits. Full retirement age is 66 or 67 years old, but the age for early \neligibility is 62 years old. Those who claim early receive a smaller monthly sum than those who wait until the \nfull retirement age. For example, someone who is set to receive $1,000 per month at the full retirement age \ncollects $750 if they start payments at age 62 and $1,320 if they delay until age 70.23   \n \nWhile the payment structures are designed to give comparable payoffs based on life expectancies, economists \nadvise that it is in almost everyone\u2019s interest to delay claims as long as possible. Indeed, waiting until age 70 \nis the best strategy for many.24 But this is not what Americans do. About 40 percent claim benefits at the \nearly eligibility age, and the vast majority claim at or before the full retirement age.   \n \nSimilar behavior appears when people are offered lump sums versus annuities. As part of the downsizing of \nthe U.S. military in the early 1990s, the Department of Defense offered severance packages to 65,000 \nmilitary personnel. They could choose between a lump sum and an annuity that was worth considerably more. \nA small majority of the officers selected the lump sum and virtually all of the enlisted personnel did. For both \ngroups, the value of the annuity was approximately 80 percent higher than the lump sum.25  \n \nResearchers set out to figure out what was going on as the brain decided between an immediate and a distant \npayoff. It turns out that different parts of the brain mediate each decision (see Exhibit 4). When the choice \nwas for a smaller but immediate reward ($10 today versus $11 tomorrow) the limbic structures were in control. \nThis part of the brain is associated with impulsive behavior and dysfunctions, including drug addiction.  \n \nWhen larger but delayed rewards are involved ($10 in a year versus $11 in a year and a day) areas of the \nprefrontal and parietal cortex are active. These areas are associated with deliberative processes and cognitive \ncontrol.26 So it appears that based on the type of problem, distinct neural systems handle the solution. \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nOctober 20, 2015 \nWhat\u2019s Going On in Your Brain? \n8 \nExhibit 4: Different Parts of the Brain Mediate Short- and Long-Term Decisions \n \nSource: Samuel M. McClure, David I. Laibson, George Loewenstein, and Jonathan D. Cohen, \u201cSeparate Neural Systems Value Immediate and Delayed \nMonetary Rewards,\u201d Science, Vol. 306, No. 5695, October 15, 2004, 503-507. \n \nThis discussion is relevant for a host of issues, including drug addiction, dieting, and saving enough for \nretirement. For investors, there are a few ways to deal with the preference for payoffs in the present. One way \nis to create default decisions, so the issue does not even come up. For instance, you may elect to dedicate all \npay raises to savings, so you will never be tempted to spend the money today. This method doesn\u2019t allow your \nbrain to deal with the problem at all and goes directly to a beneficial solution. \n \nScientists have also played with means to make our future selves concrete in our minds.27 One way to do this \nis to use software to create an avatar. This allows a 25-year-old to see, virtually, a 65-year-old version of \nherself. A glimpse of the future can encourage activity in the planning part of the brain, avoiding the limbic \nsystem, and can therefore lead to better outcomes.  \n \nMental Mistake #4: Loss Aversion and Financial Decisions         \n \nOne of the main ideas from prospect theory is loss aversion, the idea that people suffer more from losses than \nthey enjoy comparable gains. Prospect theory was developed by Kahneman and Tversky to explain how \nindividuals actually behave when faced with risky choices.28   \n \nThe loss aversion coefficient is about two, which means that the unhappiness of a $1 loss is twice as large as \nthe happiness of a $1 gain. So if you offer a proposition where a correct call of a coin toss pays $300 and an \nincorrect call costs $200, most people will turn it down. Although the expected value is $50 ([.50 x $300] + \n[.50 x -$200]) the ratio of gain to loss, 1.5, is too low for most people to play. The average coefficient of two, \nhowever, belies that there is a wide distribution across the population. Some people are highly loss averse, \nothers less so.  \n \nWomen tend to be somewhat more loss averse than men, and the old are more loss averse than the young.29 \nBut perhaps the most important issue is that our loss aversion coefficient changes based on experience. For \nexample, seasoned market participants have lower loss aversion coefficients because they ultimately have to \nmake money. But if you have been stung with losses recently, you will tend to avoid risk.  \n0.0\n-0.05\n0.05\nChoose Smaller, \nImmediate \nReward\nChoose Larger, \nDelayed\nReward\nEmotions\nHigher \ncognitive \nfunctions\nBrain Activity\nBrain structures \nthat control:\n"

      "text": " \n \nOctober 20, 2015 \nWhat\u2019s Going On in Your Brain? \n9 \nOne of the puzzles in finance is why the equity risk premium has historically been so high. The equity risk \npremium is the extra return that investors in equities earn to compensate them for owning risky stocks versus \nless-risky bonds. Researchers found that equity returns were higher than they should have been given the \nactual amount of risk.30  \n \nTwo behavioral economists, Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler, offer a solution to the puzzle through what \nthey call \u201cmyopic loss aversion.\u201d31 Look at the stock market over rolling 10- or 20-year periods and you almost \nalways see gains. But in the short run, there are lots of ups and downs. So how frequently you check your \nstock portfolio determines the probability that you will see gains or losses. \n \nThe basic idea of myopic loss aversion is that if you examine your portfolio often, you are more likely to see \nlosses. Being loss averse, you will insist on higher returns to compensate for your suffering. However, if you \ncheck your portfolio infrequently, you are more likely to see gains and hence will not require returns as high. \nThey found that the evaluation period consistent with the equity risk premium to that time was about one year.   \n \nBenartzi and Thaler\u2019s answer to the puzzle is that since people check their portfolios pretty often (myopic) they \nsuffer (loss aversion) and hence demand a high premium. But in markets, it is often the case that expected \nreturns go up as prices go down and expected returns go down when markets are up. So we end up being \nconservative when we should be aggressive and aggressive when we should be conservative.  \n \nAll of this raises an obvious question: How would we invest if we were immune to loss aversion? Researchers \ncreated a clever experiment to test the proposition. \n \nThe subjects in the experiment were endowed with $20 and told that they would play several rounds of an \ninvestment game. In each round, the subject could either invest, or not invest, one dollar. If they invested, they \nhanded their dollar to the researcher who then flipped a fair coin in full view of the subject. If it landed on \nheads, the subject lost their money. If it landed on tails, they won $2.50. If they did not invest, they kept their \ndollar for that round and went on to the next one. The experiment lasted for 20 rounds, and the subjects were \npaid the money based on the results. \n \nParticipants included normal people recruited from the local community and patients with brain damage \nstemming from stroke, surgery, or disease. The patients had ordinary intelligence, but the brain damage had \naffected their ability to process emotion. So these people could do basic math but do not feel emotion the way \nmost people do.       \n \nIt is easy to see that the best strategy in this investing game is to hand your dollar to the researcher every time, \nas the expected value for each round is $1.25 ([.50 x $2.50] + [.50 x $0]). In fact, if you played every round \nthere is only about a 1-in-8 chance of having less money than you started with, and the expected value is $25. \nHowever, keeping your dollar does prevent you from losing in any particular round.  \n \nThe brain-damaged patients finished with $25.70 on average, 13 percent more than the $22.80 the normal \npeople earned. They ended with more money because they played 45 percent more rounds than the normal \npeople did, including twice as many rounds after having suffered a loss.32 \n \nIt is hard to know exactly what the normal people were thinking, but one plausible explanation is that when \nthey lost, they preferred the sure dollar in the next round to the risk of another loss. In other words, their loss \naversion caused them to willfully give up a positive net present value proposition. \n \n"

Some traders deal \nwith loss aversion by quickly selling losers.33 Others focus on finding investments with attractive risk and \nreward characteristics and don\u2019t let past outcomes shape present decisions. This is easier said than done.

This research has lifted the veil on the mental processes behind our \nchoices. Some of the findings include the following: \n \uf402\n Humans are social and generally want to be part of the crowd. Studies of social conformity suggest that \nthe group\u2019s view may shape how we perceive a situation. Those individuals who remain independent show \nactivity in a part of the brain associated with fear. \n \uf402\n We are natural pattern seekers and we see them even where none exist. Our brains are keen to make \ncausal inferences, which can lead to faulty conclusions.  \n \uf402\n Standard economic theory assumes that one discount rate allows us to translate value in the future to \nvalue in the present, and vice versa. Yet humans often use a high discount rate in the short term and a \nlow one in the long term. This may be because different parts of the brain mediate short- and long-term \ndecisions. \n \uf402\n We suffer losses more than we enjoy gains of comparable size. But the magnitude of loss aversion varies \nacross the population and even for each individual based on recent experience. As a result, we sometimes \nforgo attractive opportunities because the fear of loss looms too large. \n \nThe challenge now is to create processes and procedures that manage or mitigate the biases that arise from \nthese tendencies.  \n \n* * * \n \nWe offer special thanks to our summer intern, Brett Roston, who is now a junior at the Wharton School of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Brett made a substantial contribution to this document, including reviewing \nresearch papers, linking the findings back to the practical implications, and creating a presentation. We \nappreciate your work, Brett. \n \n"
