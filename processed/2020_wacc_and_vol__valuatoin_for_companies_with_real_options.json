The global \npandemic created a major health challenge and an unprecedented \neconomic shock, there was plenty of political uncertainty, and the \nstock market\u2019s results were surprising to many.1 The year was also \nfascinating for investors concerned with corporate valuation. \nTheory prescribes that the value of a company is the present value of \nfuture free cash flow. The task of valuing a business comes down to \nan assessment of cash flows and the opportunity cost of capital. The \nstock prices of some companies today imply expectations for future \ncash flows in excess of what seems reasonably achievable. \nAutomatically assuming these companies are mispriced may be a \nmistake because certain businesses also have real option value.    \nThe year 2020 is noteworthy because the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC), which is applied to visible parts of the business, is \nwell below its historical average, and volatility (vol), which drives \noption value, is well above its historical average. Businesses that have \nreal option value benefit from a lower discount rate on their current \noperations and from the higher volatility of the options available to \nthem.  \nIn this report, we define real options, discuss what kinds of businesses \nare likely to have them, and review the valuation implication of a low \ncost of capital and high volatility. We finish with a method to \nincorporate real options analysis into traditional valuation. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n6186717 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n2 \n \nReal Options Defined   \nA real option is the right but not the obligation to make an investment in a company, whether it\u2019s a new line of \nbusiness, a distribution center, or a product extension. This type of analysis is useful when the cash flows from \na project have a present value that is currently less than the cost of the project. In other words, the net present \nvalue (NPV) of the project, its value minus its cost, is negative.  \nExtractive industries provide a classic example. Say a company can profitably pump oil from a well when the \ncommodity is at $40 per barrel. Now let\u2019s assume that oil is currently priced at $30 per barrel. The well has a \nnegative NPV based on today\u2019s prices but would have a positive NPV if oil rises above $40 in the future. The \nwell is valuable because the company has a real option to start it when the price is right. The value of this option \ndepends predominantly on the volatility of the price of oil.  \nAs oil prices move up and down the payoffs are asymmetric because options confer a right but not a requirement \nto act. Oil prices below $40 don\u2019t matter, but the more they exceed $40 the more valuable the project becomes. \nHigher volatility drives higher option value. \nReal options come in many forms, but most of them value flexibility or contingency.2 Flexibility options reflect \nthe ability to defer, abandon, expand, or contract a project. Contingency options capture if-then propositions. \nFor example, if a drug meets certain requirements for efficacy, then we will invest more in it.  \nExhibit 1 shows the parallels between financial call options and real options.3 Bear in mind that you should value \na company\u2019s current operations using a discounted cash flow model (DCF) or a proxy that yields a comparable \nresult. Real options analysis applies to novel activities.  \nExhibit 1: Drivers of Value for Call Options and Real Options \nCall Option \nReal Option \nVariable  \nStock price \nProject value \nS \nExercise price \nCost of project \nX \nStock price volatility \nAsset volatility \n\u03c3 \nOption life \nOption life \nT \nRisk-free rate \nRisk-free rate \nr \nSource: Timothy Luehrman, \u201cInvestment Opportunities as Real Options,\u201d Harvard Business Review, July-August 1998, 52. \nThinking through the drivers of option value is instructive even if the analogy between financial options and real \noptions is not perfect. Specifically, the inputs are generally more available and the terms more specific for \nfinancial options than they are for real options.4  \nHowever, thinking using a real options framework raises important considerations. These include when a \ncompany might exercise the option, the volatility of the underlying asset, and whether the company has access \nto capital to fund the cost of the project. \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6186717 Exp. 12/31/2024 \n3 \n \nWhere to Look for Real Options Value \nA checklist for where to look for real options has three parts. The first is the quality of management.5 Executives \neffective at real options reasoning are able to identify, create, manage, and exercise real options. Management \nreputation, proper incentives, and the ability to access capital are all important.   \nResearch reveals that few companies explicitly use real options methods, in part because of their mathematical \ncomplexity.6 But evidence also shows that practitioners use heuristics that are consistent with real options \nreasoning.7 \nNext on the checklist is the position of the business. Companies that are leaders in their industry commonly get \nthe first call when opportunities such as joint ventures arise. Size and preeminence are also associated with \neconomies of scale, which are benefits from volume, and economies of scope, which are benefits from variety.  \nThe final item on the checklist is a consideration of the sources, trends, and evolution of uncertainty.8 Asset \nvolatility must be high for a company to have substantial real option value. Uncertainty can arise from external \nshocks such as the pandemic, the potential for disruptive innovation, interactions with competitors, and the \nimpact from political decisions.       \nWe believe that real options value is meaningful for a relatively small percentage of public companies. But \ninvestors should be aware of real options value for those businesses and include it as part of the process of \nvaluation.  \nWhat Is Going On in 2020 \nTo simplify this analysis, you can think of the value of a company as having two parts. The first is the normal \noperations, which represent business as usual. You value these by taking the present value of future free cash \nflow. Alternatively, you can use a multiple, such as price-to-earnings or enterprise value-to-earnings before \ninterest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as a proxy for a DCF model. The key point is that the \nvalue is a function of the cash flows and the discount rate. \nThe second part is real options value. Real options were first described formally in 1977, but the underlying \nideas are ancient.9 This value is modest for most companies because they don\u2019t meet the criteria on the \nchecklist. But this component can be important for certain companies. You value those options using the drivers \nshown in Exhibit 1, and asset volatility is particularly important.   \nThe story is that the pandemic led central banks in advanced economics to quickly adopt fiscal and monetary \npolicies to minimize stress for households and businesses.10 Many countries followed the playbook developed \nduring the financial crisis of 2008-2009.  \nThe huge amount of liquidity has had the effect of pushing down interest rates. For example, the yield on the \n10-year U.S. Treasury note, commonly used as a risk-free rate, started the year at 1.92 percent and was at 0.84 \npercent at the end of November. This has shifted down the security market line that reflects the risk and reward \nfor various asset classes. In other words, expected returns for most asset classes are now lower than they were \nat the beginning of the year. \nA standard way to estimate the cost of equity capital is to add an equity risk premium (ERP) to a risk-free rate. \nAswath Damodaran, a valuation expert and professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York \nUniversity, estimates the ERP every month.11 He imputes the ERP by solving for the discount rate that equates \n"

His ERP estimate has declined 70 basis \npoints to 4.5 percent in 2020.  \nCombining the risk-free rate and the ERP suggests that the cost of equity dropped 1.8 percentage points from \nyear-end 2019 as of December 1, 2020. We estimate that the average cost of equity for 2020 is 6.1 percent, 1.8 \npercentage points below the average of 7.9 percent from 2015 to 2019. \nA lower cost of equity leads to a higher present value, all else being equal.12 One dollar capitalized at 6.1 percent \nis worth $16.39 ($1/.061) and at 7.9 percent is worth $12.66 ($1/.079). The value of a dollar of earnings is worth \na multiple that is 3.7 percentage points higher now than at the beginning of the year, 16.4 versus 12.7. \nThe credit spread, the premium over the risk-free rate for owning bonds, has followed a very similar path. \nExpected returns for stocks and bonds have gone down as a result of an extraordinary amount of liquidity \nfurnished by central banks around the world. Exhibit 2 shows that the cost of equity and cost of debt have moved \nin tandem over the last five years. During this period, the correlation coefficient between these series was in \nexcess of 90 percent (zero means no relationship and 1.0 reflects the strongest possible positive relationship). \nExhibit 2: Cost of Equity and Cost of Debt, 2016-2020  \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran and Moody\u2019s, retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, \nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAA. \nNote: Monthly; Cost of debt is the Moody's Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield, aggregated using averages; Cost of \nequity is the 10-year U.S. Treasury note plus the implied equity risk premium (using projected cash flows based on the \ntrailing 12-month cash flow yield). \nDespite a lower cost of capital, the economic fallout nonetheless affected businesses. Some, including those \nthat enable work from home, realized improved sales and profits while others, such as those associated with \ntravel and lodging, suffered substantially. The pandemic has created a great deal of uncertainty. \nVolatility is one way to measure uncertainty in the stock market. High volatility implies a wide range of potential \noutcomes and higher option value because the payoffs are asymmetric. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is a \nmeasure of the stock market\u2019s annual implied volatility. The VIX is calculated by translating the implied volatility \non 30-day options on the S&P 500 into an annual figure.  \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nJan-16\nMar-16\nMay-16\nJul-16\nSep-16\nNov-16\nJan-17\nMar-17\nMay-17\nJul-17\nSep-17\nNov-17\nJan-18\nMar-18\nMay-18\nJul-18\nSep-18\nNov-18\nJan-19\nMar-19\nMay-19\nJul-19\nSep-19\nNov-19\nJan-20\nMar-20\nMay-20\nJul-20\nSep-20\nNov-20\nPercent\nCost of Equity\nCost of Debt\n"

The VIX is typically lower than the implied volatility of an individual stock \nbecause the S&P 500 is diversified and hence removes most firm-specific risk. The VIX declined in the U.S. \nfollowing the election but remains more than 5 percentage points above the average.  \nA financial option with a stock price of $30, an exercise price of $40, a life of two years, and volatility of 33 \npercent is worth about $2.65. The same option with a volatility of 46.5 percent has a value of roughly $4.85.13 \nThe cost of capital and implied volatility in the market generally move together. Exhibit 3 shows how they have \ndiverged in 2020, leading to the unusual drivers of value that we have seen. \nExhibit 3: Ratio Between the VIX and the Cost of Equity, 2016-2020 \n \nSource: FactSet and Aswath Damodaran. \nNote: Monthly; Cost of equity is the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note plus the implied equity risk premium (using \nprojected cash flows based on the trailing 12-month cash flow yield). \nIt is reasonable to ask whether stock price volatility is a reasonable proxy for the volatility of real assets. The \npandemic introduced a number of factors that suggest an increase in project riskiness. These include: \n\u2022 The timing and strength of the economic recovery. Estimates from research firms for 2021 real gross \ndomestic product growth in the U.S. span an unusually wide range from 1.5 to 7.1 percent. The pandemic \nled to an acceleration of some trends, including the penetration of e-commerce, and it is difficult to assess \nto what degree the world will revert to what it was before COVID-19. Introduce operating leverage and it \nis easy to see that the potential for cash flow outcomes remains wide.     \n\u2022 Sorting of the winners and losers after impact of the pandemic subsides. The pandemic\u2019s effects \nare akin to a major perturbation to an ecosystem. Companies will die, others will thrive, and some will find \nnew niches. Predicting the outcomes from a shock to a complex adaptive system is notoriously difficult.    \n\u2022 Evolution of business models. The pandemic compelled some companies to accelerate their \ninvestments and capabilities in certain parts of their business. For example, most brick-and-mortar \nretailers had e-commerce operations prior to the spread of COVID-19, but the pandemic prompted them \nto focus on that business to compensate for the lack of store traffic. That effort will lead to changes in \norganizational capabilities and competitive dynamics.14 \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nJan-16\nMar-16\nMay-16\nJul-16\nSep-16\nNov-16\nJan-17\nMar-17\nMay-17\nJul-17\nSep-17\nNov-17\nJan-18\nMar-18\nMay-18\nJul-18\nSep-18\nNov-18\nJan-19\nMar-19\nMay-19\nJul-19\nSep-19\nNov-19\nJan-20\nMar-20\nMay-20\nJul-20\nSep-20\nNov-20\nVIX / Cost of Equity\nAverage 2016-2019\nAverage \n2020\n"

If the \npotential for real option value is low but the valuation appears to price in high value, the stock is a sell candidate. \nInversely, if the potential is high but the imputed value is low, the stock is a buy candidate as you are getting an \noption at a low cost or for free. Finally, you have to do real options analysis when both potential and imputed \nvalue are high. \nIn 2000, we did a real options case study on Amazon.com to illustrates the process.15 With the benefit of two \ndecades of hindsight, the company does appear to have been astute at identifying, creating, and exercising real \noptions to build its business.  \nOpportunities abounded in the wake of the dot-com bust, but access to capital was limited. The pandemic has \nshocked the business ecosystem, but there is ample access to capital today to exercise real options.  \nConclusion \nAlong with real pain, strife, and challenge, 2020 has brought a set of conditions that are particularly notable for \nvaluation practitioners. While some companies benefitted and others suffered from the pandemic\u2019s \nrepercussions, the policy response had the effect of lowering the discount rate and therefore increasing the \nvalue of nearly all asset prices.  \nAt the same time, the fallout from the pandemic has created substantial economic uncertainty that will lead to \ncorporate winners and losers.  \nThe cost of capital and volatility generally move in rough lockstep.

FCF represents the cash that a company is able generate after laying out the money \nrequired to maintain or expand its asset base. \n \nThe cost of capital is the rate at which you discount future cash flows in order to determine the value today. \nThe weighted average cost of capital blends the opportunity cost of the sources of capital, typically debt or \nequity, with the relative contribution of those sources.  \n \nThe discount rate is the rate at which you discount future cash flows in order to determine the value today. \n \nThe equity risk premium, also referred to as simply equity premium, is the excess return that investing in the \nstock market provides over a risk-free rate, such as the return from government treasury bonds. This excess \nreturn compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of equity investing. \n \nThe risk-free rate is the theoretical interest rate that an investor can earn on an investment that carries zero \nrisk. \n \nThe S&P 500\u00ae Index measures the performance of the large cap segment of the U.S. equities market, covering \napproximately 75% of the U.S. equities market. The Index includes 500 leading companies in leading industries \nof the U.S. economy. \n \nCorrelation is a statistical measure of how two variables move in relation to each other. \n \nThe Russell 1000\u00ae Index measures the performance of the 1,000 largest companies in the Russell 3000 Index. \nThe Russell 3000\u00ae Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies representing \napproximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market.
