Outperforming the index was particularly challenging for port-\nfolio managers in 1998 as only 28% of the stocks in the S&P 500 appreciated\nmore than the index.\nInvestors are struggling with two issues in particular. The first is the narrowness\nof the market\u2014a few large stocks are dictating the performance of the S&P\nbenchmark. The second applies mostly to value investors, who disavow owning\ntechnology names. Technology stocks have roared, contributing significantly to\nthe S&P\u2019s impressive gains in recent years.\nOur analysis suggests that the multiple expansion of many large capitalization\ngrowth companies is underpinned by a sharp rise in their returns on invested\ncapital (ROIC). While the market\u2019s valuation appears high, market multiples ob-\nscure the fact that certain companies have seen profound increases in their\nROICs while the \u201caverage\u201d company has not. Hence, relative P/E multiples\u2014a\nmainstay on Wall Street\u2014are increasingly misleading.\nWhy these select companies have seen such dramatic increases in ROIC and\nwhether or not those returns are sustainable are obvious questions. We believe\nthe answer lies in an appreciation for tectonic shifts in the U.S. economy: the\nsource of competitive advantage for many businesses is going from capital-based\nto knowledge-based strategies. As intangible assets are rarely reflected on the\nbalance sheet accurately, some \u201cNew Economy\u201d companies have demonstrated\nextraordinary returns on invested capital. Sustainability of such returns hinges on\nentry barriers, network economics, customer lock-in, and the power of economic\nwebs.\nThis report has three parts. First, we document the trend in the market-weighted\nreturn on invested capital for the S&P industrials, and show how and why market\nmultiples are less-and-less indicative of economic reality. Second, we discuss the\nemergence of a \u201cfat tail\u201d\u2014a bump on the right-hand side of a market-wide ROIC\ndistribution. It is this fat tail that is skewing both the performance of the indices\nand index-based valuation comparisons. Finally, we explore the composition shift\nin the S&P 500, and speculate about what that shift means for money managers.\nMarket-Capitalization-Weighted ROIC\nValuation is fundamentally determined by a handful of drivers, including growth\nin cash flows, returns on invested capital, and sustainability of excess returns.\nThe spread between ROIC and the cost of capital, in particular, correlates highly\nwith stock market valuation. Other issues aside, higher ROICs lead to higher\nvaluations.1\nAs S&P indices are market-capitalization weighted, their performance and valua-\ntion is biased toward the biggest companies. So while looking at median or mean\nROICs for a relevant index is a start, it is not as revealing as the market-\ncapitalization-weighted ROIC.\nTable 1 shows that the market-capitalization-weighted ROIC rose over 10 per-\ncentage points, to 25.5%, from 1995 to 1998 for the S&P Industrials. As impor-\ntant, the difference between the average ROIC and the market-capitalization-\nweighted ROIC has exploded from 200 basis points to 1300 basis points during\nthe same period. How did this happen? And what does it mean?\n1 \u201cFrontiers of Strategy\u2014Why Strategy Matters,\u201d Michael J.

(See Table 2.) These four companies, which comprised\n12.3% of the index weighting at year-end 1998, had an average ROIC of 119%.\nTo understand the surge in market-capitalization-weighted ROIC over the past\nthree years, one need not look further than Microsoft and Dell. Their combined\nmarket-capitalization-weighted ROIC went from 0.9% in 1995 to 11.1% in 1998.\nAmazingly, Microsoft was not included in the S&P 500 until June 1994.\nTable 2\nContribution to Market-Capitalization-Weighted ROIC\nS&P Industrials, year-end 1998\nCompany\nMarket-capitalization weighted ROIC contribution\nMicrosoft\n8.5%\nDell\n 2.6\nCoca-Cola\n1.2\nGE\n0.9\nSubtotal of top 4\n13.0%\nAll others (358 companies)\n12.5%\nTotal\n25.5%\nSource: Company published data, CSFB estimates.\nIt is broadly acknowledged (and lamented) that large capitalization stocks are\npacing the indices (see Table 3).

      "text": "The (Fat) Tail that Wags the Dog\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nOne key implication of this analysis is that the warranted P/E for the market\u2014\neven without consideration of lower interest rates\u2014is justifiably much higher\ntoday than it was earlier this decade. Further, these data suggest that P/E\ncomparisons relative to the market are suspect. In fact, the use of relative\nmultiples is a de facto comparison to market-dominant companies generating\nextraordinary returns and growth.\nThe (Fat) Tail that Wags the Dog\nThe above discussion can be recast visually by looking at a frequency distribution\nof ROICs (see Figure 1). What is immediately clear is that there is a fat tail on the\nright-hand side of the distribution. This fat tail contains many of the high ROIC\nbusinesses that are driving the performance and valuation of the market.\nFigure 1\nFrequency Distribution of Return on Invested Capital for the S&P Industrials\n1998E\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n-10%\n0%\n4%\n8%\n12%\n16%\n20%\n100%\n>\n200%\nROIC %\nFrequency\nSource: CSFB estimates.\nIt is interesting to note that no such fat tail existed historically. In what stands as\none of the best books ever written on shareholder value, William Fruhan provided\nthe return on equity (ROE) distributions for over 1,400 non-financial companies in\nthe 1966-1975 period (see Figure 2). While the overall shape of the distribution is\nvery similar to that of today, there were no companies earning the outsized re-\nturns we now see.2\n2 Although ROE is not directly translatable into ROIC, Fruhan actually adjusted the ROEs to remove the deleterious effect of\nexcess cash. There were no material differences, making the ROE/ROIC comparisons reasonable.\n"

Fruhan, Jr., 1979.\nSome market pundits have compared today\u2019s strong-performing large capitaliza-\ntion stocks with the Nifty Fifty from the early 1970s. However, we find that the\ncomparison is somewhat superficial, if only based on return measures. We esti-\nmate that the average ROE for the Nifty Fifty was about 19%, sharply lower than\nthe 32% market-capitalization-weighted ROIC of the top 50 stocks in the S&P\nIndustrials for 1998. (See Appendix A.)\nHow did the fat tail emerge? We believe it is an outgrowth of a fundamental,\nongoing shift in the United States from the \u201cOld Economy\u201d to the \u201cNew Economy.\u201d\nIn plain language, this means that the economy is moving away from industries\nwhere physical capital or resources are the foundation for competitive advantage\ntoward businesses where knowledge, or intellectual capital, is the driver of\nadvantage.\nThe implication is straightforward: with only modest invested capital require-\nments, many New Economy companies generate higher ROICs than their capital-\nladen Old Economy brethren. Accordingly, New Economy companies often de-\nserve higher-than-average multiples, even after adjusting for options liability and\ngreater industry instability.\nFurther, we believe that the \u201cmental models\u201d applied to understand traditional\nbusinesses do a poor job of explaining the dynamics of New Economy compa-\nnies.3 For example, some businesses enjoy increasing, rather than decreasing,\nreturns as the result of positive feedback mechanisms. Microsoft\u2019s dominance of\nPC operating systems is a good case in point.\nThe \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcome of many technology markets has only recently\nbeen well documented. Updated mental models are useful for understanding not\nonly how and why the fat tail emerged but whether or not these high returns are\nsustainable.\n3 \u201dFrontiers of Strategy\u2014On the Shoulders of Giants,\u201d Michael J.

There\nhas been a pronounced shift away from Old Economy businesses to New Econ-\nomy industries (see Tables 4 and 5). Technology\u2014which only represented about\n5% of the index 35 years ago\u2014now represents over 20%. Notably, the technol-\nogy weight was less than 10% as recently as 1993.\nTable 4\nWeightings of Selected S&P 500 Industries\n1998 versus 1964\nSector\n1964\n1998\nUtilities\n19.2%\n3.1%\nEnergy\n17.8\n5.7\nBasic Materials\n16.5\n3.1\nTechnology\n5.5\n19.4\nSource: Standard & Poor\u2019s.\nValue investors typically cite two objections to investing in technology stocks. The\nfirst is that they do not understand technology\u2014it is outside their circle of com-\npetence. Warren Buffett is perhaps the best-known value investor to indulge in\nthis line of reasoning. We believe that investors should strive to be adaptive.\nTechnology is profoundly changing many industries, and we believe it will be diffi-\ncult to generate above-market-average returns without a firm grasp of key strate-\ngic and financial drivers. Technology is simply too large, and too important, to\nignore.\nSecond, value investors insist that current technology valuations cannot be sup-\nported. While we are not here to justify present valuations, we believe the \u201cover-\nvalued\u201d case stems more from a lack of appreciation of business models than\nundue optimism. The challenge of valuing technology companies is further com-\npounded by the winner-take-all nature of some markets. Within some sectors,\nleading companies enjoy valuation premiums 5 to 10 times their less fortunate\ncompetitors.\n"
