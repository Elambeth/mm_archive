      "text": "July 15, 2013  \n \nAlpha and the Paradox of Skill \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nJim Rutt, formerly both the chief executive officer of Network Solutions and chairman of the board at the \nSanta Fe Institute, recently gave a talk about his experience in business. He mentioned that he played a lot of \npoker when he was young, became pretty good at it, and made some money.  \n \nRutt assumed that the best way to ensure continued success was to improve his skill, so he worked diligently \nat honing his game by learning the probabilities for each hand and studying other players for clues about the \nstrength of their position. At that point, an uncle pulled him aside and doled out some advice. \u201cJim, I wouldn\u2019t \nspend my time getting better,\u201d he advised, \u201cI\u2019d spend my time finding weak games.\u201d \n \nSuccess in investing has two aspects. The first is skill, which requires you to be technically proficient. \nTechnical skills include the ability to find mispriced securities (based on capabilities in modeling, financial \nstatement analysis, competitive strategy analysis, and valuation all while sidestepping behavioral biases) and a \ngood framework for portfolio construction. The second aspect is the game in which you choose to compete. \nSome games are highly competitive and others are not. You want to find games where your skill is greater \nthan that of the other players. Your absolute skill is not what matters; it\u2019s your relative skill.      \n \nThink about it this way. Say I invited you over to my house to play poker on Saturday night\u2014and that you like \nto win. Your first question should be, \u201cWho else will be there?\u201d If I tell you that there will be some players that \nare as skilled as you and a couple of rich players who don\u2019t play well, your response should be: \u201cI\u2019ll be right \nover.\u201d Why? While you know the amount of money entering the house at the beginning of the evening and \nleaving at the end of the night is the same, you can see how your gain will come at the expense of the weaker \nplayers.  \n \nOn the other hand, if I tell you that the players expected that evening have skill that is equivalent to yours, the \nresponse should be: \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m busy.\u201d In this case, there\u2019s no reason to believe that you will come out a \nwinner because there is no mismatch in relative skill. And if you find yourself in a game unsure of which \nplayers are weak or strong, learn a lesson from Warren Buffett: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in the game 30 minutes and \nyou don't know who the patsy is, you\u2019re the patsy.\u201d1   \n \nIn cases where two or more players have the same level of skill\u2014whether that skill is high or low doesn\u2019t \nmatter\u2014the skills of the players offset one another and luck becomes the primary determinant of the outcome. \n\u201cPlayers\u201d can be athletes, investors, or business executives. In many competitive realms, including investing, \nthe skills of the participants have improved on an absolute basis but have shrunk on a relative basis. Today\u2019s \ninvestor has vastly more resources and training than his or her predecessor from years past. The problem is \nthat investors, broadly speaking, have gotten much better which means that the difference between the skill of \nthe best and the average participant isn\u2019t as great as it used to be. \n \nThe Paradox of Skill \n \nThink of results as the sum of a draw from a skill distribution and a draw from a luck distribution (treat both as \nindependent random variables). It turns out that we can use a theorem from statistics to show that: \n \nVariance(skill) + Variance(luck) = Variance(result) \n \nThis is sometimes called the \u201cPythagorean Theorem of Statistics\u201d because if you rewrite variance as standard \ndeviation squared, you get a formula that looks very similar to the Pythagorean theorem in geometry.2 Here\u2019s \n"

      "text": "July 15, 2013  \n \nAlpha and the Paradox of Skill \n3 \nthe crucial observation for our purpose: If the variance in the skill distribution is shrinking and the variance in \nluck is stable, luck plays a growing role in shaping results. An absolute improvement in skill, when combined \nwith a relative decline in the range of skill, means that luck is more important than ever.3 This concept is called \nthe \u201cparadox of skill.\u201d  \n \nThe late Stephen Jay Gould, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, wrote about this to explain why no \nhitter in Major League Baseball has had a batting average over .400 since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941.4 He \nshowed that the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) declined steadily over the past \ncentury, which is consistent with a declining variance in skill and stable variance in luck. Gould concluded that \nthe skill of modern players is better than ever but that the spread of skill has narrowed. Follow-up studies in \nbaseball support this hypothesis.5  \n \nPeter Bernstein applied this approach to mutual funds and found that the margin of outperformance of the \nmost successful funds had declined from the early 1960s through the late 1990s.6 Consistent with \nBernstein\u2019s results, Exhibit 1 shows that the standard deviation of excess returns has trended lower for U.S. \nlarge capitalization mutual funds over the past five decades. The exhibit shows the five-year, rolling standard \ndeviation of excess returns for all funds that existed at that time. This also fits with the story of declining \nvariance in skill along with steady variance in luck.     \n \nThese analyses introduce the possibility that the aggregate amount of available alpha\u2014a measure of risk-\nadjusted excess returns\u2014has been shrinking over time as investors have become more skillful. Investing is a \nzero-sum game in the sense that one investor\u2019s outperformance of a benchmark must match another \ninvestor\u2019s underperformance. Add in the fact that in aggregate investors earn a rate of return less than that of \nthe market as a consequence of fees, and the challenge for active managers becomes clear.7  \n \nExhibit 1: Decline in Standard Deviation of Excess Returns for U.S. Large Capitalization Funds \n \nSource: Markov Processes International, Morningstar, and Credit Suisse.  \n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\n18%\n1967\n1972\n1977\n1982\n1987\n1992\n1997\n2002\n2007\n2012\nStandard Deviation of Excess Returns\nNumber of funds\n69\n109\n135\n159\n244\n372\n679\n1,136\n1,233\n1,024\n"

      "text": "July 15, 2013  \n \nAlpha and the Paradox of Skill \n4 \nDavid Hsieh, a professor of finance at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, made an effort to quantify \nthe amount of alpha available to hedge funds. He started with total available returns and then subtracted the \ncomponents of return that fund managers can easily replicate. After plugging in the numbers, he concluded \nthat the average amount of available alpha is three percent of assets under management (AUM) for the hedge \nfund industry. He did his calculation in 2006, a time when AUM for the hedge fund industry were $1 trillion. \nThis suggested $30 billion in available alpha. If we apply the same percentage today, available alpha for hedge \nfunds is about $65 billion. \n \nHsieh\u2019s approach anticipated that rapid growth in AUM in the hedge fund industry would lead to lower average \nexcess returns. He said, \u201cIf that amount of alpha remains constant and is extracted from the market by hedge \nfund managers, it has to be extracted from another part of the market, most likely from such traditional \nmanagers as mutual funds. So, as more assets are allocated to the hedge fund industry, the average alpha \nper hedge fund dollar will decline\u2014even though in aggregate, the total amount of market inefficiency will \nremain the same.\u201d8  \n \nResearch shows that money managers are more likely to construct portfolios that mimic their benchmarks in \nmarkets that are efficient than in those that are less efficient. So there is more closet indexing in developed \nmarkets than in developing markets, in large stocks than in small stocks, and in the stocks of old firms than in \nyoung firms.9 Analysis suggests that closet indexers in the U.S. market, at over one-third of the AUM, run \nmore money than pure index funds. Closet indexers ran less than two percent of the AUM in 1980.10 Further, \nthe popularity of closet indexing is rising in almost all markets and segments.     \n \nSorting causality in closet indexing is a challenge. It is not clear whether investors are hugging the benchmark \nbecause excess returns are difficult to achieve or whether excess returns are difficult to achieve because \ninvestors are hugging the benchmark. Causality probably runs in both directions. In the U.S., a couple of other \nfactors are likely at play. Institutions, which tend to focus on performance relative to a benchmark, are \nincreasingly dominating the investing landscape. And in 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nrequired all mutual funds to disclose a benchmark in their prospectus. This disclosure may have heightened \nmanager attention to results relative to a benchmark.  \n \nDifferential Skill May Be Narrowing but It Still Exists \n \nWhile most acknowledge that generating alpha is a challenge, it is important to avoid pressing the case for \nreduced relative skill too far. Careful studies of active managers, including work by the well-known professors \nof finance Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, show that some level of differential skill is necessary to fit the \nempirical record.11 For example, Fama and French estimate that a normal distribution of true alpha with a \nmean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.25 percent fits the cross-sectional data on mutual fund returns. \nWhile differences in skill may be smaller than in past eras, they still exist. \n \nDispersion in asset returns also influences the dispersion in fund returns.12 Research suggests that realized \nasset dispersion leverages manager skill. So returns for an active manager will be higher than expected when \nrealized asset dispersion is high. The intuition behind this is that greater asset dispersion creates a larger \nopportunity set for an active manager.13 There is a positive correlation between the breadth of opportunities \nand the dispersion of fund returns. This relationship holds across twenty or so asset classes.14 \n \nThe sharp run-up in the U.S. market in the late 1990s and into early 2000, as well as the 2008-2009 \nfinancial crisis, provides powerful evidence for the link between the dispersion in asset and fund returns. The \ndecades-long downward trend in standard deviation in excess returns spiked violently, fed by a sharp rise in \n"

But the popping of the dot-com bubble resulted in plummeting price dispersion and a \nreturn to the long-term trend of falling fund return dispersion. \n \nDavid Swensen, the chief investment officer of Yale University\u2019s endowment, uses the dispersion of active \nmanagers as a proxy for market efficiency. He discusses the dispersion of returns\u2014which he measures as the \ndifference between the returns for first and third quartile funds\u2014in various asset classes, suggesting that he \nseeks to invest in active managers only where dispersions are high. \u201cYou want to spend your time and energy \npursuing the most inefficiently priced asset classes,\u201d he told the students during a lecture, \u201cbecause there\u2019s an \nenormous reward for identifying the top quartile venture capitalist and almost no reward for being the top \nquartile of the high-quality bond universe.\u201d15   \n \nOne of the puzzles in finance is why active management remains such a large business when academics have \nargued for decades that markets are too efficient to beat. Indeed, U.S. equity funds went from $25 billion in \nAUM in 1980 to $3.5 trillion in 2010. Further, despite index funds and exchange-traded funds going from a \nnegligible share in 1980 to about 30 percent of the market today, asset-weighted fees are actually higher \ntoday than they were in 1980.16 This doesn\u2019t consider the substantial growth in AUM for hedge funds, which \ncharge higher fees on average than mutual funds do. \n \nJonathan Berk and Richard Green, professors of finance, derived a model that may help explain the puzzle.17 \nThey suggest a world where there are skillful investment managers who deliver positive, risk-adjusted excess \nreturns. Both the managers themselves and investors recognize this skill. The manager\u2019s ability to deliver \nexcess returns is limited, however, by AUM. In other words, each dollar investors add has the effect of \nreducing the expected return of the portfolio. \n \nWhat would you expect in this world? Skillful managers attain more assets through positive inflows until their \nexpected returns fall to a level roughly equal to that of the market.18 A point of equilibrium exists where all \nmanagers, irrespective of their level of skill, have identical expected returns. In this model, Berk and Green \ndon\u2019t measure skill simply as excess return. Rather, they examine the expected value the fund adds, which is \nthe abnormal return times the AUM. \n \nHere\u2019s an example to make the idea more concrete.19 In his first five years running the Magellan Fund at \nFidelity, Peter Lynch had monthly gross alpha of 2 percent on roughly $40 million of AUM. In his final five \nyears, he had 0.2 percent monthly gross alpha on $10 billion of assets. So his value added went from \n$800,000 per month (.02 * $40 million) to $20 million per month (.002 * $10 billion). So while Lynch\u2019s \npercentage gross alpha decreased as his fund grew, his value added increased. As in other competitive labor \nmarkets, the portfolio manager captures most of the excess rents generated by his or her skill through higher \ncompensation.20 \n \nWhile more sophisticated than what is depicted here, the Berk and Green model explains many of the \nempirical facts and is consistent with the paradox of skill.    \n \nPicking Your Game \n \nHow do you find games where you have an edge in relative skill? The answer is complex but we will focus on \nthree areas: diversity breakdowns, institutions versus individuals, and inefficiencies that arise from technical \nselling or buying. All areas represent pockets of inefficiencies that are likely to persist, but the opportunities \nmove around across asset classes and geographies. As a result, style-box constraints can be limiting because \na manager is relegated to a single game, whether or not opportunities exist. \n"

      "text": "July 15, 2013  \n \nAlpha and the Paradox of Skill \n6 \nThere are three classic paths to market efficiency: rational investors, arbitrage, and the wisdom of crowds.21 In \nthe rational framework, investors understand their preferences and correctly trade off risk and return. Because \nthe model is based on the theory of general equilibrium, it assumes that asset prices are correct. Given the \npreponderance of evidence against both its assumptions and predictions, the \u201crational investors\u201d approach has \nfew supporters.  \n \nThe arbitrage argument, which suggests that arbitrageurs cruise markets and close aberrant price gaps, is \nmore compelling. Arbitrageurs do exist and their actions do narrow many price gaps. However, there are two \nproblems with the argument. The first is that there are limits to arbitrage. Even if arbitrageurs see an \nopportunity, they may not be able to exploit it for technical reasons. For example, an arbitrage trade may \nrequire going long one security and short another. If shorting a stock, for instance, is prohibitively expensive, \nthe arbitrageur will be unable to do her job.22 \n \nAnother problem is that arbitrageurs sometimes fail to act, for a host of possible reasons, even when \nwonderful opportunities exist. One well-documented example is the arbitrage between the \u201coff-the-run\u201d      \n(29 \u00bd-year maturity) and \u201con-the-run\u201d (30-year maturity) Treasury bonds in August 1998. These are nearly \nidentical securities, but the off-the-run bond used to trade a little cheaper than the on-the-run bond because it \nwas slightly less liquid. So when the yield spread between the two bonds was sufficiently wide, arbitrageurs \nwould buy the off-the-run and short the on-the-run bonds, almost a perfect arbitrage. Because the securities \nwere so similar, arbitrageurs used leverage to bolster the returns from the trade.  \n \nHowever, in the summer of 1998 the spread widened and rather than arbitrageurs buying the cheap bond and \nselling the dear one, they fled the trade altogether. So the widening in the spread became \u201cself-feeding rather \nthan self-limiting\u201d as arbitrageurs failed to play their typical role. This is one of the trades that led to the \ndemise of Long-Term Capital Management.23 \n \nThe final way to get to market efficiency is through the wisdom of crowds.24 More formally, we can describe \nmarkets as complex adaptive systems.25 One advantage to this approach is that it sets out the conditions \nunder which markets are efficient. \n  \nMarkets yield proper values when investors hold diverse views, there is a properly functioning aggregation \nmechanism to extract information from investors, and when incentives reward smarter participants. When one \nor more of those conditions are violated, there is inefficiency. Diversity is by far the most likely condition to be \ncompromised. Rather than investors thinking and behaving independently, they correlate their behavior and \ncreate excesses in markets. \n \nMost booms and busts start with a kernel of truth and run to extremes. The peak of the dot-com bubble in \nMarch 2000 or the lows of the S&P 500 in March 2009 following the financial crisis are but two recent \nillustrations. Crucially, the relationship between the degradation of diversity and a change in asset prices is not \nlinear. Following a period of diversity loss, a small incremental change in diversity can lead to a large-scale \nchange in asset price.26 Crowded trades can stay crowded for a while before there is a violent move in the \nopposite direction. \n \nSo the first game to find is one where you can take the other side of a diversity breakdown. Seth Klarman, \nfounder of the successful hedge fund The Baupost Group, has a wonderful line that can guide action: \u201cValue \ninvesting is at its core the marriage of a contrarian streak and a calculator.\u201d27 The \u201ccontrarian streak\u201d part \nensures that you are in a game where you can take the other side of a popular trade. But there are occasions \nwhen the consensus is correct. The \u201ccalculator\u201d part allows you to assess whether the one-sided trade has led \nto a mispriced asset, hence presenting attractive upside with a proper margin of safety. \n"

      "text": "July 15, 2013  \n \nAlpha and the Paradox of Skill \n7 \nNote that diversity breakdowns can last for a long time and can be on a large scale. For instance, buying U.S. \nlarge capitalization stocks in 1982 following a dismal decade and proclamations of the death of equities would \nhave led to tidy returns over the better part of the subsequent two decades. Part of the definition of skill \nincludes finding asset classes that are likely to do well, or poorly, for an extended period of time. That provides \na favorable backdrop for attractive absolute returns. \n  \nThe second game is when you, as an institution, compete with individuals. This is similar to a professional \npoker player going against an amateur. The professional has the edge over the long haul, but it\u2019s hard to \npredict who will come out ahead in the short run. Individuals are particularly vulnerable at market extremes. \nThere is good evidence that institutions are more skillful than individuals.  \n \nOne example is participation in the market for initial public offerings (IPOs). Research suggests that IPOs with \nhigh institutional ownership do better than those with low ownership because institutions are better at \ninterpreting public information.28 That more IPOs take place following good returns in the market likely plays a \nrole as well, suggesting that both technical skill and a reduction in diversity play a role in this finding. \n \nA similar thread of research reveals that institutions do a more effective job of interpreting news than \nindividuals do. One well-known finding is that markets tend to underreact to news about future cash flows. \nWhen the news is good institutions buy stocks from individuals, and when the news is bad the institutions sell \nto individuals. As a result, institutions earn a premium to individuals in these cases.29      \n \nThis game of institution versus individual has become scarcer, as institutions have come to dominate markets. \nCheck out this quotation: \n \nIn just ten years, the market activities of the investing institutions have gone from only 30 percent of \ntotal public transactions to a whopping 70 per cent. And that has made all the difference. No longer \nare the \u201cNew Breed on Wall Street\u201d in the minority; they are now the majority. The professional money \nmanager isn\u2019t competing any longer with amateurs who are out of touch with the market; now he \ncompetes with other experts.30      \n \nThat comes from Charley Ellis\u2019s famous paper, \u201cThe Loser\u2019s Game,\u201d published in 1975. Ellis provided an early \narticulation of the paradox of skill in investing, and it remains one of the best. In the last half century, the role \nof individuals has diminished substantially in the United States. In 1950, individuals held over 92 percent of \nequities. Today, they hold less than half. Individuals do tend to get more active at extremes\u2014especially after \nstrong up moves\u2014but day to day it\u2019s the institutions slugging it out against one another.   \n \nOther markets are less developed than the U.S., which means that institutions have more of an opportunity to \ncompete with individuals. In a study that included all investors in Taiwan over a five-year period ended in 1999, \nresearchers found that institutions earned excess returns of 1.5 percentage points while individuals suffered \nan annual performance drag of 3.8 percentage points. Most of the poor performance by individuals was the \nresult of aggressive, and unprofitable, trading. As the study concludes starkly, \u201cIndividuals lose, institutions \nwin.\u201d31    \n \nSo the games where institutions compete with individuals are vanishing, but appear when markets are at \nextremes and in markets that have yet to develop fully. When institutions go head-to-head with individuals, \nthey tend to fare well. \n \n"

      "text": "July 15, 2013  \n \nAlpha and the Paradox of Skill \n8 \nThe final pocket of inefficiency is taking advantage of investors who need to buy or sell for non-fundamental \nreasons. In these cases, the disadvantaged investors have an incentive, or are forced, to buy or sell with little \nor no regard for the fundamental asset value.     \n \nTake corporate spin-offs as an example. In a spin-off, a company distributes the shares of a subsidiary to its \nshareholders. For instance, Time Warner spun off Time Warner Cable to its shareholders in 2009. The \nacademic research supports the view that spin-offs generate attractive returns.32     \n \nThe basic story is that large institutions that own a particular stock frequently do not want to own the shares of \nthe company being spun off, generally because it is smaller than the parent and has weaker financial \ncharacteristics. Further, these institutions often have constraints based on investment style. So they spend \nlittle time doing research and simply jettison the spin-off. 33  \n \nDistressed selling is another illustration of this form of inefficiency. John Geanakoplos, a professor of \neconomics at Yale and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute, has developed what he calls the \n\u201cleverage cycle.\u201d34 He notes that as an asset price is rising, the cost to borrow is low but so is the margin \nrequirement. For example, Ellington Capital, a hedge fund specializing in mortgage securities, was able to buy \n$100 of collateralized mortgage obligations in 2006 by putting up $15 and borrowing $85. So its margin \nrequirement was 15 percent. \n \nIndeed, the margin requirement can decline as the asset price rises. This is what happened in the U.S. \nresidential housing market. Geanakoplos notes that of the $2.5 trillion in \u201ctoxic\u201d mortgage securities in 2006, \nthe buyers put down $150 billion and borrowed $2.35 trillion for about a 16-to-1 leverage ratio. Buyers put up \nonly 6 percent of the purchase price of a home, in contrast to a historical norm closer to 20 percent. The easy \naccess to credit exaggerated the upward price move in homes and created the conditions for a powerful \ntumble when the process reversed. \n  \nOnce the asset price starts to drop, there are two effects that feed one another. First, the lower asset price \ntriggers a margin call, which leads to forced selling. Second, lenders raise the margin requirement, \naccelerating the virulence of the feedback loop. As the financial crisis started to unfold, Ellington Capital saw \nits margin requirements jump to 40 percent, only to reach a peak of 70 percent in the second quarter of 2009.  \n \nThe violence of the move on the downside, compounded by a rising margin requirement and hence margin \ncalls, forces some investors to sell assets that they don\u2019t want to sell. That creates an opportunity for the \nbuyer on the other side. Geanakoplos\u2019s idea is to use margin requirements more proactively and counter-\ncyclically. That is, make borrowing harder as an asset climbs in price and easier as the price falls.  \n \nEven leaving aside the amplifying effects of leverage, there is evidence that some investors benefit at the \nexpense of others in distress. Research suggests, for instance, that some hedge funds generate profits by \ntargeting mutual funds that are suffering outflows.35 Further, and consistent with the literature on the limits of \narbitrage, short sellers can get caught in situations where they have to buy for non-fundamental reasons.  \n \nThis discussion of inefficiencies\u2014places where you want to play the game\u2014would be incomplete without a \ncomment about the permanence of investor capital. Exploiting inefficiencies is easy to discuss intellectually, \nbut difficult to execute emotionally. Investors in a fund are likely to be most scared precisely when the \nopportunities are best, and if they choose to withdraw capital they ensure that both their returns, and the \nreturns of the manager to whom they had entrusted their funds, will suffer.  \n \n"

These investment firms can find and play the right games.  \n \nSummary \n \nIn investing, as in many other activities, the skill of investors is improving on an absolute basis but shrinking on \na relative basis. As a consequence, the variance of excess returns has declined over time and luck has \nbecome more important than ever. Still, differential skill continues to exist. This process is called the paradox \nof skill.   \n \nThe key to generating excess returns is to not only be skillful but to find attractive \u201cgames\u201d\u2014situations where \nyou can see where your excess returns are likely to come from. This report touched on three of those pockets \nof inefficiencies\u2014diversity breakdowns, institutions versus individuals, and trading with investors who are \nbuying for non-fundamental reasons\u2014but there are undoubtedly more. The main lessons are that sometimes \nit\u2019s more important to worry about the game you\u2019re in than the skill you bring, and that you should always try \nto avoid being the patsy.         \n \n* * * \n \nWe offer special thanks to John Lloyd and Chetan Jadhav, Private Banking Americas Managed Accounts, for \nproviding data and for their valuable input into this discussion.  \n \n"
