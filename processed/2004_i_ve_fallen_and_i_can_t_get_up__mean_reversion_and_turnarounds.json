An associated finding . . . is that even if superior performance is achieved \nand sustained for a period of time, the probability of slipping from that lofty perch is \nrelatively high. \nRobert R. Wiggins and Timothy W. Ruefli\nSustained Competitive Advantage 1\nReturns and Growth \nIn a recent New York Times article, finance professor Josef Lakonishok argues that \ntoday\u2019s stock market has many \u201cpockets of craziness.\u201d 2 Lakonishok\u2019s case is based \non the relationship between growth and price-earnings ratios, and suggests that the \nmarket is implying unrealistically rapid earnings growth rates for some companies with \nlofty price-earnings multiples. Research he conducted with a pair of colleagues shows \nthat very few companies sustain high growth rates. 3 \nBut what really determines a price-earnings ratio? A company\u2019s value is a function of \nthe market\u2019s expectations for its growth rate and its economic returns. This \nfundamental concept explains why looking at growth in isolation can be so misleading. \nGrowth can be good (when a company earns returns in excess of the cost of capital), \nbad (when returns are below the cost of capital), or neutral (when returns equal the \ncost of capital).  \nYou must first have a clear sense of whether or not a company is earning appropriate \nreturns before you can judge the impact of growth. Companies can, and do, grow their \nway to bankruptcy. 4 Likewise, some low-growth, high-return businesses consistently \ncarry premium valuations. Studying growth in isolation of economic returns is an \ninvitation to failure. \nGaining a firm grasp of a company\u2019s prospects for economic returns requires a \nthorough understanding of competitive strategy. 5 The goal of strategic analysis is to \naddress three fundamental questions: \n1. Is the company generating returns on investment above the cost of capital, or is \nthere good reason to believe it will earn attractive returns in the future? \n2. If returns do exceed the cost of capital, for how long can the company sustain its \nexcess returns? 6 \n3. Once a company\u2019s returns dip below the cost of capital, what\u2019s the probability it \ncan stage a sustained recovery to above-required returns? \nIn this piece we take a closer look at the latter two questions, drawing on empirical \ndata from the technology and retail industries to bring the points to life. \nMichael J.

      "text": "    Page 2 \nDeath, Taxes, and Reversion to the Mean \nOne microeconomic theory that is well documented empirically is the notion that a company\u2019s return on \ninvestment reverts to the cost of capital over time. 7 The theory, and intuition, is straightforward. \nCompanies that generate high returns attract competition and capital, which drive returns toward \nopportunity-cost levels. Similarly, capital flees poor return industries\u2014through bankruptcy, disinvestment, \nor consolidation\u2014lifting returns back to the cost of capital. \nExhibit 1 shows this process for a sample of over 450 technology companies from 1979 to 1996. (We \nstopped at 1996 to avoid issues related to the bubble.) 8 We ranked companies in quartiles based on their \ncash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae), and followed the return patterns. Because CFROI is a real, \nafter-tax measure, the time series is unaffected by the potentially distorting shifts in interest rates and \ninflation. \nExhibit 1: U.S. Technology CFROI Fade \n(15)\n(12)\n(9)\n(6)\n(3)\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nYears Forward after Quartile Ranking\nCFROI (%)\n4\n3\n2\n1\n(15)\n(12)\n(9)\n(6)\n(3)\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nYears Forward after Quartile Ranking\nCFROI (%)\n4\n3\n2\n1\n(15)\n(12)\n(9)\n(6)\n(3)\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nYears Forward after Quartile Ranking\nCFROI (%)\n4\n3\n2\n1\n(15)\n(12)\n(9)\n(6)\n(3)\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nYears Forward after Quartile Ranking\nCFROI (%)\n4\n3\n2\n1\n \nSource: CSFB HOLT. \nThe top group earned an average CFROI of 15% during the initial period and declined to 6% after only \nfive years. The worst group went from 15% negative returns to zero (still well below the cost of capital) \nwithin five years. The middle two quartiles showed relative stability around cost-of-capital levels. The \nreturn gap between the highest and lowest quartiles went from 3,000 basis points at the first \nmeasurement period to just 300 basis points after ten years. While ten years in insufficient to complete \nthe reversion-to-the-mean process, much of the progression is evident within that timeframe. \nConsistent with theory, attrition plays a central role in the improvement of lowest-quartile returns. Just \n60% of the lowest-quartile companies were active after five years, as many of the poor performers went \nbankrupt or were acquired. This attrition creates a survivorship bias, allowing returns to rise during the \ndecade. In contrast, 85% of the firms in the highest-return quartile were active after five years. Attrition \nrates across all quartiles tend to average out after five years. \nOne consistent feature across the many mean-reversion studies is that some companies (albeit not many) \ncan and do earn persistently high returns. In our study of nearly 700 retailers from 1950 to 2001, 14% of \nthe companies never earned below their cost of capital. 9 Of the 1,700 technology companies in our \nsample from 1960 to 1996, 11% sustained an unblemished record of positive excess returns. \n"

      "text": "    Page 3 \nSustaining high returns is a huge potential source of wealth. Given two companies with the same initial \nreturns and future growth rates, the business that can sustain above-cost-of-capital returns longer will be \nsignificantly more valuable, and hence will trade at a much higher valuation multiple. 10 \nA strategic assessment of a business earning high returns should reveal the source of the excess \nspread\u2014typically either a consumer or production advantage\u2014and provide some framework to consider \nthe longevity of that advantage. Further, some businesses (especially those in network and knowledge \nbusinesses) enjoy increasing returns as they grow. 11 A company\u2019s strategic strengths, and the economics \nthat result, are essentially overlooked by a singular focus on growth. \nI\u2019ve Fallen and I Can\u2019t Get up \nStock prices reflect expectations, and the key to generating superior long-term returns is to successfully \nanticipate expectation revisions. An important corollary is that neither a good (i.e., high-return) business \nnor a bad (low-return) business is inherently attractive or unattractive. Investors need to assess the stocks \nof all companies versus expectations. 12 \nIn this spirit, we took a look at a particular class of companies\u2014those that have realized a downturn. \nHere, we define a downturn as two consecutive years of CFROI below the cost of capital following two \nyears of returns above the cost of capital.  \nThis analysis is particularly important for value investors, who often buy companies that are statistically \ninexpensive in the hope that economic returns improve. The classic value trap is buying a cheap company \nthat deserves to be cheap based on poor economic returns. But buying a company that is cheap because \nof a temporary downturn is potentially very attractive if the market does not anticipate the turnaround. \nExhibit 2 shows what happens to companies that realize a downturn. Our sample includes almost 1,200 \ncompanies from the technology and retail sectors. The data for the two industries are strikingly similar, \nand not particularly encouraging: Only about 30% of the sample companies were able to engineer a \nsustained recovery. (We define a sustained recovery as three years of above-average returns following \ntwo years of below-cost-of-capital results.) Roughly one-quarter of the companies produced a non-\nsustained recovery. The balance\u2014just under half the population\u2014either saw no turnaround or \ndisappeared. Companies can disappear gracefully (get acquired) or disgracefully (go bankrupt). \nExhibit 2: I\u2019ve Fallen and I Can\u2019t Get Up \nTechnology 1\nRetail 2\nNo turnaround\n45%\n48%\nNon-sustained turnaround\n26%\n23%\nSustained turnaround\n29%\n29%\nTechnology 1\nRetail 2\nNo turnaround\n45%\n48%\nNon-sustained turnaround\n26%\n23%\nSustained turnaround\n29%\n29%\n \n1 Sample of 712 companies, 1960-1996. \n2 Sample of 445 companies, 1950-2001. \nSource: CSFB HOLT. \nWithin this analysis, we were also able to see how long companies experienced downturns. For both \nretailers and technology companies, roughly 27% of downturns lasted only two years, and for both sectors\nover 60% of downturns lasted for less than five years. In other words, the destiny of most firms that live \nthrough a downturn is determined rather quickly. \nThese mean reversion and turnaround data underscore how strong and consistent competitive forces are. \nMost stocks that are cheap are cheap for a reason, and the likelihood that a business earning poor \nreturns resumes a long-term, above-cost-of-capital profile is slim. \nYet the evidence that high-return persistence does occur (and the likelihood that markets misprice this \npersistence) suggests that investors with a strong grasp of competitive dynamics and a sufficient \ninvestment horizon have an opportunity to realize superior returns.  \n"
