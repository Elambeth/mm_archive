This process requires you to \nunderstand current expectations and why they are likely to change. A \ncompany\u2019s fundamental results are the primary catalyst in expectations \nrevisions. These include drivers such as sales growth, operating profit \nmargins, and return on invested capital. Successful long-term investors \nsee where expectations are headed based on their forecasts for \nfundamental results.   \nAmple research shows that most experts do not make great forecasts.1 \nThis might appear to be a problem if you are in the business of making \npredictions. But it turns out that the ability to explain what happened \nafter the fact, often in a way that flatters your faulty prediction, is an \nincredibly effective coping mechanism. Barbara Mellers, a professor of \npsychology at the University of Pennsylvania, says, \u201cWe find prediction \nreally hard, but we find explanation fairly easy.\u201d2 We tell stories to \nourselves and others to paper over our poor predictions. \nThe news is not so gloomy. The U.S. intelligence community \nsponsored a forecasting tournament that allowed scientists to measure \nthe accuracy of predictions pertaining to social, political, and economic \nevents. That analysis revealed that one-in-fifty forecasters, dubbed \n\u201csuperforecasters,\u201d consistently made better predictions than did the \nother participants.3 \n \n \n \n \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

But part of their success relies on habits that can be \u201clearned and \ncultivated by any intelligent, thoughtful, determined person.\u201d4 While the superforecasters had a clearer crystal \nball than the other forecasters, there are ways the rest of us can sharpen what we see. \nStatisticians and psychologists rolled up their sleeves and delved into the data to find out what distinguished the \nbest from the rest.5 They explain their results using what they call the \u201cBIN Model,\u201d where \u201cB\u201d refers to bias, \u201cI\u201d \nto information, and \u201cN\u201d to noise. Most investors are very familiar with how various forms of bias can degrade the \nquality of decisions.6 Investors are also acutely aware that they operate in a world of incomplete information.  \nNoise, on the other hand, tends to get less attention. Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics \nbased in part on his work on bias, wrote an article with some collaborators where he stated, \u201cWhere there is \njudgment, there is noise\u2015and usually more of it than you think.\u201d7 \nThis leads to the most striking finding the data revealed: the difference between superforecasters and regular \nforecasters is \u201cdue more to noise than bias or lack of information.\u201d The researchers conclude that \u201creducing \nnoise is roughly twice as effective as reducing bias or increasing information.\u201d8  \nWe now define the elements of the BIN Model and examine how they apply to investment organizations. We \nthen review the BIN Model in a world of prices. We finish with a discussion of how to reduce noise and bias, and \nto increase information.  \nUnpacking the BIN Model \nNotwithstanding the model\u2019s acronym, we shuffle the order of the components and discuss noise, bias, and then \ninformation. This rearrangement reflects the importance of noise and the relative lack of familiarity with the \nconcept and its implications. Bias is better understood in the investment community but must be applied \ncarefully. Information is the easiest to appreciate yet remains a source of potential forecasting edge.   \nNoise. Noise is \u201cthe chance variability of judgments.\u201d9 It is relevant in a number of settings. First is when \ninterchangeable professionals make a judgment based on the same set of facts. For example, Money magazine \nasked 50 accountants to calculate the taxes due for a hypothetical family of 4 with an income of $132,000. \nExhibit 1 shows the difference between each of their estimates and the actual taxes due. The accountants all \ndeal with the same tax code, often use the same software, and have the same facts in front of them. However, \nthey commonly rely on their individual judgment to arrive at the tax due. Noise measures the difference between \nthe answers that two accountants provide based on the same case. \nFor instance, say Accountant A provides a figure of $10,000 and Accountant B says $14,000. Noise is calculated \nas the difference between the numbers divided by the average. In this case, the noise index would be 33 percent \n($4,000/$12,000). Managers find a noise index of around 10 percent acceptable when judgment is necessary.  \nThe accountants in the test by Money magazine came up with a range of taxes due from $9,806 to $21,216 and \nan average noise index of 20 percent, a \u201cdepressing\u201d result.10 Noise audits in the insurance and finance \nindustries reveal even higher average indexes, in the range of 40-60 percent. \n \n \n \n"

Topolnicki, \u201cThe Pros Flub Our Third Annual Tax-Return Test,\u201d Money, March 1990, 90-98. \nAn organization that has a group of analysts who assess various investment opportunities has to consider the \nrole of noise. What would happen if multiple analysts were assigned to appraise the stock of the same company? \nMight they come to different or even opposite conclusions? We have done noise audits in the classroom and in \nthe field with ranges similar to other domains. \nAnother setting where noise is relevant is when the same person evaluates similar decisions over time.11 You \nmight treat the same decision differently from one moment to the next based on factors such as your mood, \nhunger, fatigue, or recent experience.  \nIn a classic study, researchers showed pathologists, experts who study body tissue to identify disease, the same \nbiopsy slides at two different times. The average correlation between their overall judgments of disease was \n0.63.12 The correlation would have been 1.0 had the pathologists judged the biopsies the same each time. Wine \njudges do even worse. Their ratings of the same wine over a short span had an average correlation of just 0.50.13  \nYou can imagine analysts presenting ideas to a portfolio manager. That portfolio manager may choose to act or \nnot based on details that have little to do with the merit of the investment idea. For example, research reveals \nthat individuals willingly pass on an opportunity with a positive net present value if they have recently lost \nmoney.14 Kahneman and his colleagues note that \u201coften noise is far above the level that executives would \nconsider tolerable\u2014and they are completely unaware of it.\u201d15 \nNoise is also important to consider when a group makes a unique strategic decision that relies on the evaluation \nof a lot of complex information. Examples include hiring a new employee, proceeding with a costly acquisition, \nor funding a start-up. In these cases, a lot of information has to be refined into a go or no-go decision.     \nA key feature of noise is that it is not systematic. You can imagine shots at a target that are scattered randomly \naround the bullseye (see the right panels of exhibit 2). As a result, it is not possible to anticipate how any \nparticular forecast will deviate from the true signal.

Most people use rules of thumb, more formally called heuristics, to cope with the high information demands \nof decision making. For example, the availability heuristic describes when a decision maker assesses the \nlikelihood of an event by how easy it is to remember similar instances. The availability heuristic explains why \npeople fear flying more than normal after hearing about a plane crash.  \nHeuristics can be valuable because they save time in making decisions.16 A bias is the result of an inappropriate \napplication of a heuristic to come to a decision. The refusal to fly after news about a plane crash illustrates the \npoint.  \nTwo biases that are widespread in investing are overconfidence and confirmation. The forms of overconfidence \ninclude overestimation, overplacement, and overprecision.17 Overestimation means you are overconfident in \nyour abilities and overplacement relates to the confidence that you are better than those around you. These \nforms are relevant when certain conditions are met.  \nOverprecision is particularly important in investing and business. People tend to be overconfident about how \nright they are when answering questions that are difficult. This is relevant for forecasting.  \nWe presented 50 true-false questions to more than 10,000 subjects and asked them to answer either true or \nfalse and to indicate how confident they are in their answer. Exhibit 3 displays the results. Fifty percent \nconfidence is equivalent to a guess and 100 percent confidence suggests certainty.  \nWe saw that overall, people assign an average confidence of 70 percent but are correct 60 percent of the time. \nError also tends to be greatest when the subjects are most confident. This finding is well established in the \npsychological literature.18 One manifestation of overconfidence is unprofitable excess trading.19 \nLow Bias, Low Noise\nLow Bias, High Noise\nHigh Bias, Low Noise\nHigh Bias, High Noise\n"

You \nalso interpret ambiguous information in a way that confirms your belief.20 The ability to update your views \neffectively is crucial to making sure your beliefs accurately reflect the world. That investors sometimes \nunderreact to information in the short term is consistent with slow belief updating.21   \nWe have mentioned two prominent biases investors must overcome, but other biases exist as well.22  \nHeuristics can lead to decisions that have systematic bias. They are predictable. You can now imagine shots at \na target that miss the bullseye by similar amounts in the same direction (see the bottom panels of exhibit 2). But \nto calculate bias you need to know the answer. The nature of the error, nonsystematic for noise and systematic \nfor bias, is a crucial difference and is what allows researchers to separate the impact of each. \nInformation. Full information allows forecasters to predict with complete accuracy. Information in this context \nmeasures the subset of signals that forecasters use relative to full information. There are a few factors that can \nlead to disparate levels of information among forecasters, including unearthing new information, the speed and \naccuracy of updating views, placing different weights on the components of information, and being more skillful \nat dealing with signal complexity.   \nWhen the researchers tallied why the superforecasters were so much better than the regular forecasters, they \nfound the difference was roughly 50 percent from reducing noise, 25 percent from reducing bias, and 25 percent \nfrom increasing information. It\u2019s important to recognize that because noise and bias are independent sources of \nerror, reducing either one of them improves forecasts.  \nExhibit 4 summarizes the key characteristics of the BIN Model. \nExhibit 4: The BIN Model \nBIN \nComponent \nDescription \nNature of Error \nContribution to \nSuperforecaster Edge \nBias \nInappropriately applying a rule of thumb \nSystematic \n~25 percent \n \n \n \n \nInformation \nForecasters have incomplete information \n  \n~25 percent \n \n \n \n \nNoise \nChance variability of judgments \nNonsystematic \n~50 percent \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nCorrect (Percent)\nConfidence (Percent)\n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n2997544 Exp. 03/31/2021 \n6 \n \nThe BIN Model in a World with Prices  \nThe BIN Model clearly captures concepts that are important in decision making and forecasting. But here\u2019s an \ninteresting intellectual exercise to consider: Does noise, bias, or a lack of information matter in an efficient market \nwhere stock prices reflect information about future prospects with perfect accuracy? \nNoise suggests that two interchangeable analysts might place very different values on the stock of the same \ncompany. But what if there is already a price? Noise is irrelevant because the stock price is the correct answer. \nBias does not matter for the same reason. And while you may not have full information, the market does and it \nis in the price.     \nMarkets are not perfectly efficient, of course, but large and liquid markets are very good.23 The impact of noise \nand bias is much smaller on stock market investors than it is for accountants or insurance underwriters because \nthere is a baseline of price determined by the collective of investors. Those prices tend to capture a lot of \ninformation in a market comprised of investors with diverse models and points of view.24 That said, we believe \nthe elements of the BIN Model offer investors useful lessons in assessing an investment process.  \nFinancial economists have used the concepts of \u201cnoise traders\u201d and \u201cnoise allocators\u201d to explain markets for \ndecades.25 Noise traders \u201cmake random trades in financial markets,\u201d trade \u201con noise as if it were information,\u201d \nand \u201cwould be better off not trading.\u201d Noise allocators \u201cmake random allocations to asset managers.\u201d26 Noise \ntraders provide liquidity and earn below-market returns that allow informed investors to generate excess returns \nto offset the cost of gathering information.    \nSome models that include noise traders portray the market more accurately than models that rely solely on \nrational investors.27 The impact that noise traders have on markets is a function of arbitrage costs, which include \nidentifying and verifying mispricing, implementing and executing trades, and financing and funding securities. \nWhen those costs are low, informed investors quickly correct mispricings and markets converge rapidly to fair \nvalue. When arbitrage costs are high, gaps between price and value can persist. \nThe obvious recommendation is to avoid being a noise trader or noise allocator. That means investing based on \nsignals, which requires gathering and properly assessing information. Understanding the investor on the other \nside of any investment is crucial to having a clear sense of your edge and the motivations of your counterparty. \nAnother area where noise can creep in is position sizing. Effective investing has two components. The first is \nfinding edge, where a security is mispriced and hence offers the prospect of excess returns. The second is \nposition sizing, or how much money to invest in the idea.  \nThe investment industry spends a lot of time on edge and little time on sizing, and it is likely that sizing decisions \nare noisy for many portfolio managers. Research shows that investment managers leave returns on the table by \nfailing to follow the position sizes suggested by their own processes.28  \nIndividual bias, systematic departures from ideal decisions, are hard to pinpoint in a market that is mostly \nefficient. But there is some evidence that it exists. For example, recent research suggests that portfolio managers \nmake buy decisions that add value but sell decisions that are poor. A study of more than 780 portfolios and 4.4 \nmillion trades from 2000 through 2016 found that portfolio managers would have been better off selling a random \nposition in their portfolio than the security they did sell. The poor selling resulted in raw portfolio returns that were \n70 basis points lower per year.29  \n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n2997544 Exp. 03/31/2021 \n7 \n \nConsultants studied the portfolios of their clients and found that risk-adjusted excess returns of individual stocks \nfollow an inverted-U pattern, the \u201calpha lifecycle,\u201d and that portfolio managers tend to hold stocks too long, on \naverage.30  \nMost major market dislocations are not the result of vagaries in individual forecasting but rather in collective \nbehavior, where investors converge to the same set of beliefs. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s is a good \nexample. In these cases, the wisdom of crowds flips to the madness of crowds and substantial opportunity \npresents itself. However, the psychological, professional, and business toll of going against the crowd in these \ncases can be very high.31 \nHow to Avoid the BIN Sin \nThe goal of training is to improve results. The scientists involved in recruiting competitors for this tournament \nprovided some of the forecasters with training and withheld it from others. This allowed them to measure the \nimpact of training by comparing the group who received it to the control group who did not. Training improved \nforecasting accuracy by about 10 percent, as captured by a measure of the accuracy of probabilistic predictions \ncalled a Brier Score.32  \nTraining comes in various categories. Teaching subjects about judgment errors and biases is cheap but useless. \nTeaching subjects how to check for bias is more effective, as is providing timely feedback. There is also value \nin learning how to ask good questions and reframe problems.33 The main point here is that knowing about how \nyou are likely to go wrong isn\u2019t as valuable as adopting methods to improve decisions. \nWhen the researchers examined the impact of training on overall accuracy, they found something that surprised \nthem: The training improved accuracy more by reducing noise than by tamping down bias. This finding raises \nprovocative questions about how exactly training affects the various aspects of decision making.  \nWe now turn to methods to improve decisions for each component of the BIN Model. \nNoise. The three primary ways to reduce noise are combining judgments, using algorithms, and adopting the \n\u201cMediating Assessments Protocol.\u201d \nBecause noise is nonsystematic, the first way to reduce it is to combine forecasts.34 This is the core idea behind \nthe wisdom of crowds.35 While each individual may be off the mark in a random way, combining the forecasts \nreduces the error and increases accuracy. Jack Treynor, a luminary of the investment industry, offered this as a \nmeans to understand market efficiency.36 \nAbraham de Moivre produced the math to support this principle in the early 1700s. De Moivre\u2019s equation says \nthat the standard error of the mean is equal to the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root \nof the sample size. In plain words, the equation says that the error decreases as the sample size increases.37 A \nkey underlying assumption, which is consistent with the very definition of noise, is that errors are independent \nand follow a normal, bell-shaped distribution around the correct answer. Forecasting accuracy is compromised \nwhen there is no effective way to aggregate the information, or if the errors become correlated and noise \ntransitions to collective bias. \nMarkets are a mechanism to aggregate views. The involvement of money means there is an incentive to figure \nout and express a correct view. Negative feedback, where departures from equilibrium are pushed back toward \nequilibrium, tends to prevail in public markets. Arbitrageurs buy what\u2019s cheap and sell what\u2019s dear to take \nadvantage of small mispricings. This makes prices more accurate.  \n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n2997544 Exp. 03/31/2021 \n8 \n \nBut from time to time markets flip from negative to positive feedback, which reinforces a trend. There are \ninstances when positive feedback is useful and necessary. In the context of markets it is often a signal that \neveryone is thinking the same way, which raises the specter of inefficiency.  \nBusinesses and individuals often don\u2019t use aggregation because of the cost. Think of the example of the \naccountants calculating the taxes due. The average of all the guesses was much closer to the correct answer \nthan the average guess of the individual tax preparers, but retaining 50 accountants to do your taxes is very \nexpensive.     \nIf you are dealing with noisy forecasts and have a cost-effective way to combine them, do so. The forecast is \nvery likely to be more accurate than a single forecast. \nA second means to reduce noise is to use an algorithm, which is simply a set of rules or procedures that allow \nyou to achieve a goal. For example, a cake recipe is an algorithm. If you follow the procedures for how to \ncombine the ingredients and bake the batter, you will end up with a tasty cake.  \nIn 1954, Paul Meehl, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota, wrote a book claiming \nthat statistical methods outperformed clinical methods in making patient prognoses.38 This was not a popular \nfinding, as clinicians placed great value on the judgments based on their training and experience. However, his \nfinding has proven to be robust. One meta-study concluded that the \u201c[s]uperiority for mechanical-prediction \ntechniques was consistent, regardless of the judgment task, type of judges, judges\u2019 amounts of experience, or \nthe types of data being combined.\u201d39 \nNotwithstanding the superiority of algorithms in many domains, many professionals are still slow to embrace \nthem and are quick to blame them when things go wrong.40 Even research that shows individuals are willing to \ndefer to algorithms notes that \u201cexperienced professionals, who make forecasts on a regular basis, relied less on \nalgorithmic advice than lay people did, which hurt their accuracy.\u201d41 \nThere are many situations where it is impractical to use an algorithm because the cause and effect is too loosely \nlinked. The advice here is to consider carefully if any aspect of your investment process is best handled \nsystematically. One example is the use of checklists to ensure consistency and thoroughness.42 \nAnother example is the size of positions within a portfolio. We saw earlier that many portfolio managers do not \nstick to their own rules in sizing their positions, to the detriment of their performance.  \nPortfolio construction is based on inputs, constraints, and objectives.43 Inputs include expected returns, volatility, \nand the correlation between assets. Constraints reflect issues such as position, industry, and sector limits, \ntrading volume, and leverage. Objectives include single- or multi-period evaluation horizons. Once a portfolio \nmanager specifies these factors, position sizing can be algorithmic. \nResearch has found that one way to increase the acceptance of algorithms is to allow humans to adjust the final \nanswer just a bit.44 Daniel Kahneman calls this \u201cdisciplined intuition.\u201d45 The idea is to approach a problem \nsystematically and then give your own judgment or intuition a role in the final decision. The evidence shows that \nallowing that wiggle room improves the overall quality of the decision. \nThe final approach to reducing noise is to adopt the Mediating Assessments Protocol (MAP).46 The idea is to \ncreate intermediate ratings based on what\u2019s critical in order to come to a final decision that is more informed \nthan relying solely on intuition. \n"

First, you \u201cdefine the assessments in advance.\u201d You figure out what\u2019s important to arrive \nat a thoughtful result. For instance, if you are interviewing a candidate to be a financial analyst, you consider the \nattributes that would lead to success, including skills in valuation, strategy assessment, critical thinking, and \ncommunication.   \nThe second step is to use facts to evaluate the candidate based on those criteria. If more than one person is \ninvolved with the assessment, each should work independently. The result should be a numerical score for each \nattribute. To continue with the example of our analyst, each interviewer would evaluate and score the candidate \non the relevant criteria. It is also important for each interviewer to ask the same questions in the same order for \nevery candidate.47 \nFinally, there should be a discussion about a final decision only after all of the assessments are complete and \nscored. The power of the method is that the decision-making approach is standardized. \nFor investors in public markets, MAP may be more useful in guiding organizational decisions than investment \nchoices. But investors in private markets will find the tool valuable, if only to ensure the investment process is \nconsistent, rigorous, and thorough.  \nExhibit 5 summarizes the three primary ways to reduce noise. \nExhibit 5: Techniques for Reducing Noise \nMethod \nDescription \nMechanism \nCombine \njudgments \nGather forecasts from individuals who are \noperating independently \nReduces error by offsetting \nnonsystematic individual errors \n \n \n \nUse algorithms \nA set of rules for performing a task \nEvidence-based algorithms outperform \nexperts in many domains \nAdopt Mediating \nAssessments \nProtocol (MAP) \n1.

The first is to incorporate base rates into a forecast, which \naddresses overconfidence. It is common for forecasts to be too optimistic, whether it\u2019s the cost and time to \nremodel a home, how long it will take to complete a task, or the growth rate of a company. Introducing base \nrates often tempers and grounds an estimate.      \nMost of us follow a similar pattern when asked to make a forecast: we gather information, combine it with our \nown experience and views, and project into the future. Psychologists call this approach, which relies on a large \ndose of intuition, the \u201cinside view.\u201d48 \nIntegrating base rates, the \u201coutside view,\u201d with the inside view generally improves the accuracy of forecasts. The \noutside view is a \u201csimple statistical analysis of analogous efforts completed earlier.\u201d49 The outside view asks, \n\u201cwhat happened when others were in this situation before?\u201d Your specific forecast is recast as an instance of a \nlarger reference class rather than a one-off forecast that relies heavily on the experience and perceptions of the \nforecaster. \n"

Say a financial analyst forecasts as a base case that a \ncompany with annual sales of $10 billion will grow sales 20 percent per year for the next 5 years. In all likelihood, \nthat analyst will have a detailed model substantiating that projection. That is the inside view. \nThe outside view would examine how many companies of that size have achieved a compound annual growth \nrate of sales at that level or higher. The answer is 3.5 percent.50 Would you be inclined to modify a base case \nthat assumes a 50 percent probability of 20 percent growth if the base rate reveals a frequency of 3.5 percent?  \nThere are four steps to using the outside view. The first is to select the reference class. You want the reference \nclass to be broad enough to be robust but narrow enough to be useful in your application. There are good data \nfor many domains, including corporate performance and investing.51 \nThe next is to assess the distribution of outcomes for that reference class. Some follow a normal, bell-shaped \ndistribution (\u201cmild randomness\u201d). This is largely true for measures of corporate and investor performance. But \nothers follow a distribution with lots of skew, and in some cases a power law (\u201cwild randomness\u201d).52 Base rates \nare straightforward to apply for mild distributions and less informative for wild distributions, but we have found \nthat introducing base rates improves the forecaster\u2019s thinking. Further, base rates are woefully underutilized \neven in contexts where their application is clearly beneficial.  \nThe third step is to make a forecast. An understanding of the base rates for the situation should inform both a \npoint forecast and a range of possible outcomes. \nThe final step is to consider how much to regress your estimate toward the mean. The rule of thumb is that when \noutcomes are close to random, you should regress your forecast substantially. When outcomes are driven by \nskill and are therefore persistent, you need not regress much at all. \nTo continue with our example of a company, sales growth rates are much less persistent than operating profit \nmargins. As a consequence, very high or low expectations for sales growth are better candidates for regression \ntoward the average than are very high or low margins. This recognizes that operating profit margins are to a \ndegree a function of sales growth.53    \nLearning about base rates was the most significant contributor to accuracy for those forecasters who received \ntraining. Considering base rates reduces noise and bias.   \nA second method to remove bias is to create formal mechanisms to open the mind to alternative possibilities. \nOne technique to do this is a premortem.54 With a premortem, you have a group imagine that a decision was \nmade and that the outcome was a disaster. Each team member then writes down why the result was poor and \nreviews the reasons. Premortems rely on a mechanism called \u201cprospective hindsight,\u201d which consistently \ngenerates more scenarios than simply projecting into the future.55  \nStudies show that the premortem method more reliably reduces bias than other techniques do, including getting \nindividuals to consider pros and cons or just cons.56 Conducting a premortem is not difficult, time consuming, or \ncostly, but there are common mistakes that forecasters make that are avoidable.57   \nStructured approaches to considering other views are also helpful.58 These include \u201cred teaming,\u201d where some \nindividuals are assigned to advocate a view that differs from the consensus.59 Both premortems and red teams \nhelp offset overprecision, one of the manifestations of overconfidence. \nA final method to reduce bias is to create a rigorous process to provide accurate and timely feedback. One of \nthe challenges within the investment industry is that the ultimate measure of results is portfolio returns, adjusted \n"

But stock price movements can be very noisy, which means that feedback from the market itself is \nunreliable in the short-term. \nOne way to address the problem is to identify signposts and assign numerical probabilities that they occur. An \ninvestor trying to generate an excess return buys or sells a stock because he or she has a variant perception, a \nview that is different than what the market implies.60 An analyst can distill the thesis that supports the variant \nperception into specific departures from the consensus. For example, an investor might believe that sales or \nmargins will be higher than what\u2019s priced in. As information related to those specific differences is revealed, you \ncan think of yourself as passing a signpost that tells you whether you are on the right path.  \nA useful signpost has three features. It has an outcome that can be objectively agreed upon, within a specified \ndate, and is important to the overall thesis. For instance, if the consensus is that a company will sell 100 widgets \nthis year and your variant perception is that they will sell more than that, the signpost might be, \u201cThere is an 80 \npercent probability that the company will sell 110 or more widgets in the year.\u201d \nOne crucial point is that forecasts should use numerical probabilities instead of words, which can be interpreted \nto represent a wide range of probabilities.61 Numbers allow for an ability to score forecasts precisely and to avoid \nex post justifications. \nNote that the use of signposts allows for accurate intermediate feedback that leads to the ultimate goal of \ngenerating excess returns. By breaking down the process, a forecaster receives more opportunities to learn from \nmistakes and cultivate the skill of calibration. Research shows that forecasters improve when they receive \nfeedback of this quality.62  \nDebiasing methods introduce base rates to ground forecasts, premortems and red teams to open minds to \nalternative outcomes, and signposts to create a way to learn from mistakes. The methods produce spillover \neffects that help manage noise as well.        \nInformation. The first and most obvious way to improve forecasts is to gain access to information before others \ndo. This is especially difficult in markets because of Regulation Fair Disclosure, which was implemented in 2000 \nand prevents companies from disclosing material privately without simultaneously revealing the same \ninformation to the public.  \nThere are some ways, however costly, to access relevant information. These include acquiring and analyzing \nproprietary data sets, working with top-flight lawyers to interpret laws or regulations, or hiring consultants to \naccurately assess storm damage.  \nFor example, an alternative data company that tracks the tail numbers of private jets, among other things, \nobserved that a jet owned by Occidental Petroleum landed at the Omaha, Nebraska airport in the spring of 2019. \nOmaha is the home of Warren Buffett, chief executive officer of the cash-rich conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway. \nOccidental announced a large investment from Berkshire Hathaway a couple of days later. The data company\u2019s \nclients included hedge funds thirsty for information.63 Most investors cannot pursue this source of edge because \nthe cost is high. \nA framework including signposts requires a forecaster to explicitly articulate a view that is different than what the \nmarket reflects. As new information becomes available, the forecaster must be able to overcome confirmation \nbias and revise his or her view to reflect that information. Analysis of the forecasters in the tournament revealed \nthat the frequency of belief updating was \u201cthe strongest single behavioral predictor of accuracy.\u201d64  \n"

Psychologists distinguish between the strength of \nevidence for a hypothesis and its weight, or \u201cpredictive validity.\u201d65 Use a coin toss as an example. The strength \nis the ratio of flips that come up heads to those that come up tails. The weight is the sample size, or number of \nflips.  \nForecasters tend to be overconfident when the strength is high and the weight is low. For example, when heads \nshows up 7 times after 10 flips, the forecaster is likely to be overconfident in an assessment that the coin is \nbiased (this will happen in 1 in 8 times with a fair coin).   \nForecasters tend to be underconfident when the strength is low and the weight is high. For example, when heads \nshows up 5,100 times after 10,000 flips, the forecaster is likely to be underconfident that the coin is biased (this \nwill happen about in 1 in 50 times with a fair coin).    \nUsing information effectively means getting an informational advantage when you can, updating your view \naccurately and promptly to reflect new information, and placing the proper weight on the information at your \ndisposal. \nConclusion \nYou can use the BIN Model to assess your decision-making process, with a heightened awareness of the large \nand potentially overlooked role of noise. The techniques we describe to address noise, including averaging, \nusing algorithms, and adopting the Mediating Assessments Protocol, don\u2019t ensure accuracy but have been \nshown to help improve predictions. Further, the training techniques designed to reduce bias appear to be \neffective in dealing with noise as well.  \nYou can also use the model to evaluate the decision-making processes of others, including companies, \norganizations, and competitors. Because noise tends to be overlooked or ignored, improving consistency can \nadd a great deal of value. For example, when Kahneman and his colleagues asked executives of a large global \nfirm for estimates of the cost of noise in their companies, they suggested it would be \u201cmeasured in the billions\u201d \nand that even small reductions in noise would be worth \u201ctens of millions.\u201d66 Identifying companies that adopt \npractices to reduce noise may be the source of excess returns. \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 17-19 \n"
