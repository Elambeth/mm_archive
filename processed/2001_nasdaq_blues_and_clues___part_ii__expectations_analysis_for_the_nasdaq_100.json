This is by far the\nmost important driver of value. We estimate that over 50% of the\nNasdaq\u2019s three- and 12-month decline stems from this moderation.\n\u2022 We figure that the discount rate has increased about 25 basis\npoints, to roughly 14.5%, since the end of November. Given the\ngeneral concerns about the sector, it is no surprise that investors\nrequire a higher return to participate in it.\n"

We believe\nour proprietary valuation work offers unique insight into current market\nexpectations and the revisions in those expectations over the past three and 12\nmonths. Further, our tools provide investors with the necessary calibration and\nsensitivity analysis to make forward-looking investment decisions.\n\u2022 \nValue is driven by the future cash flows discounted to a present value at an\nappropriate discount rate. We can segregate cash flow forecasts into three\npieces: a base level of earnings, future growth in earnings, and reinvestment\nneeds. Given that the Nasdaq 100 is largely comprised of capital efficient,\nknowledge-based companies, capital efficiency plays a very limited role in the\nsharp revisions in expectations. However, base earnings, as well as\nanticipated earnings growth and discount rates, are all worthy of discussion.\nFigure 1\nNasdaq 100 Nosebleed: Lower Estimates, Lower Growth Expectations,\nHigher Required Rate of Return\nCREDIT FIRST\nSUISSE BOSTON\nMarch 31, 2000\nNovember 30, 2000\n###\nIncome Statement Data:\nFiscal Year (Income statement date):\n2001\n2001\n2001\nEBITA - NASDAQ Proxy\n137,764.3\n114,743.1\n####\nBusiness Model Value Creation:\nEBITA growth rate:\n21.1\n18.5\nPretax ROIIC\n150.0\n150.0\n##\n Note: Aftertax ROIIC\n97.5\n97.5\n97.5\nDiscounting Mechanism ( Investment Neighborhood):\nRequired Rate of Return (cost of capital):\n12.66\n14.25\nValue horizon years (from balance sheet date to CAP):\n19.0\n20.0\n###\nC.A.P.

      "text": "Nasdaq Blues and Clues\u2014Part II\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nOur analysis shows the following (see Figure 1):\n\u2022 \nSince the end of November, analysts have cut 2001 earnings estimates\n(based on our internal estimates) about 6%. Earnings reductions account for\nless than 25% of the Nasdaq\u2019s fall, by our calculation, over the past three and\n12 months.\n\u2022 \nExpectations for future earnings growth rates have dropped fairly\nprecipitously. In March 2000, the expected growth rate stood at just over\n21%, by November 2000, that number was about 18.5%. Over the past three\nmonths, the earnings growth rate has come down further, and is now about\n16.1%. For the Nasdaq, earnings growth is, by far, the most important driver\nof value. We estimate that over 50% of the Nasdaq\u2019s decline is the result of\nthis reduction. Since most companies in the index are so-called New\nEconomy companies, and hence capital efficient, they are extremely\nsensitive to growth.\n\u2022 \nWe figure that the discount rate is now roughly 14.5%, up from 14.25% in\nNovember and about 12.7% in March 2000. The higher rate of return reflects\ncontinued investor concern about the sector. This increase is the final 25% of\nthe index\u2019s drop.\nBulls and Bears\nInvestors continue to passionately debate over whether or not the market\u2019s\ncorrection is overdone. We believe that the expectations approach frames the\ndiscussion in a very useful way.\nThe bull case is that better economic growth and/or firmer IT spending fuels an\nincrease in long-term earnings growth rate assumptions. Relatively modest\nincreases in the expected growth for the Nasdaq 100 would lead to sharp\nappreciation.\nThe bear case notes that earnings estimates and growth rates remain too high,\nand may be subject to further, substantial, downward revision.\nSensitivity Analysis\nIn order to quantify the impact of these varying views, we provide some sensitivity\nanalysis:\n\u2022 \nA future 10% change in aggregate composite earnings equals a change in\nthe index of about 9%.\n\u2022 \nA one percentage point (100 basis point) change in the expected growth rate\nequates to a delta in the index of about 10%.\n\u2022 \nA 50 basis point change in the discount rate represents a shift in the index\nvalue of about 7%.\n"
