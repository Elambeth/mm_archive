      "text": " \n \nPage 2 \n \n      Legg Mason Capital Management \nThe purpose of a company is to maximize long-term value. As such, the prime responsibility of a \nmanagement team is to invest financial, physical, and human capital at a rate in excess of the opportunity \ncost of capital. Operationally, this means identifying and executing strategies that deliver excess returns. \nOutstanding executives assess the attractiveness of various alternatives and deploy capital to where its \nvalue is highest. This not only captures investments including capital expenditures, working capital, and \nacquisitions, but also share buybacks. There are cases where buying back shares provides more value to \ncontinuing shareholders than investing in the business does. Astute capital allocators understand this. \n \nExhibit 1 shows how companies in the U.S. have apportioned dollars over the past quarter century in \ncapital expenditures, M&A, share buybacks, and dividends. From 1985 through 2011, spending on capital \nexpenditures was roughly twice that of M&A. Spending on M&A was about 50% higher than dividends \nand buybacks combined. So for every dollar spent in these four areas, roughly $0.55 went to capital \nspending, $0.27 to M&A, and $0.18 to dividends and buybacks.  \n \nResearch shows that capital expenditures can generate returns in excess of the cost of capital, and it \nappears that they have done so in the aggregate over the past 25 years.1 M&A creates value if you \nconsider the seller and buyer together, but the value tends to go to the seller while buyers earn about the \ncost of capital. 2 Buyers tend to do worse the larger the percentage premiums they pledge to acquire their \ntargets, and research shows that the market\u2019s initial reaction to M&A is not biased. 3  \n \nNot surprisingly, the exhibit reveals that the year-to-year changes in capital expenditures and dividends \nare much more modest than those for M&A and share repurchases. Indeed, M&A and buybacks follow \nthe economic cycle: Activity increases when the stock market is up and decreases when the market is \ndown. This is the exact opposite pattern you\u2019d expect if management\u2019s primary goal is to build value.  \n \nExecutives should always seek to allocate capital to the opportunities with the highest returns. But M&A \nand share buybacks generally happen when times are good and don\u2019t happen when times are more \nchallenging, meaning that executives struggle to consistently create value with these investments. While \nthere may be an economic rationale for a pattern that follows the economic cycle\u2014access to capital may \nbe more challenging in tougher times, for example\u2014it\u2019s more likely a case of mental accounting: capital \nexpenditures and dividends have priority to M&A and buybacks irrespective of the prospective returns \nfrom the alternative investments. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n"

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The table above is for illustrative purposes only and is not \nreflective of an actual investment. \n \nIn theory, dividends and buybacks are equivalent assuming no taxes, identical timing of cash receipts, \nand an efficient market. 4 In practice, they are very different. Take, for example, the issue of taxes. Even \nwhen the tax rates for dividends and capital gains are the same, as they are now, there\u2019s an advantage to \nbuybacks. This is because a shareholder can choose to defer tax payments by not selling shares today\u2014\nthink of this as refusing a \u201cdividend\u201d today in exchange for a potentially larger dividend down the road. \nPaying a tax bill in the future is better than having to pay one today.  \n \nThere\u2019s a more fundamental reason that dividends and buybacks are different, and it\u2019s the result of how \nexecutives think of them. Executives consider dividends on par with investment decisions such as capital \nspending. Once a board has instituted a dividend, executives like to increase the payment steadily over \ntime and hate the idea of cutting it. As a result, the aggregate stream of dividends is less volatile than the \nstock market or the allocation to share repurchases. \n \nExecutives think of buybacks as an alternative for spending residual cash. If there\u2019s money left over after \na company has paid all of its bills (including dividends) and made all of the investments it deems \nworthwhile, executives will consider a buyback. Because they are viewed as a residual, buybacks are \nmuch more volatile than dividends. Exhibit 2 shows dividends and share buybacks for the companies in \nthe S&P 500, as well as the price level for the index. Buybacks bounce around more than dividend \npayments do and more closely track the S&P 500 Index. 5 \n \n \n \n"

Please note that an investor cannot directly invest in an index. \n \nAnother noteworthy point is that the value of executed buybacks exceeded that of dividends in 2004 and \nhave remained at a higher level ever since (with the exception of the height of the financial crisis in 2009). \nIt is common for market prognosticators to compare today\u2019s dividend yield to those of the more distant \npast and to point out that the yield isn\u2019t what it used to be. \n \nBut it was only in 1982 that Congress enacted rule 10b-18, which provided companies with a safe harbor, \nor a legal shield from the threat of being sued if they followed certain rules. Rule 10b-18 made buybacks \nviable on a large scale for the first time in modern history. Recent research shows that there is no \nevidence that companies have a lower propensity to distribute cash to equity holders\u2014it\u2019s just that the \nform of payment has shifted from dividends to buybacks. 6 \n \nStill, there remains widespread confusion about the role of dividends in delivering total shareholder \nreturns. The key point is that price appreciation is the only source of investment returns that increases \naccumulated capital over time. Capital accumulation comes from three sources: how much a shareholder \ninvests, how long he invests, and price appreciation. A shareholder will earn the total shareholder return \nonly if he reinvests 100 percent of his dividends back into the stock in a tax-free account. A very small \npercentage of investors, either institutional or individual, actually do so. Price appreciation is the driver of \ncapital accumulation over time. 7 \n \nThat said, there is research that shows that corporate events that contract assets, including spinoffs, \nbuybacks, debt prepayments, and dividend initiations, are followed by good shareholder returns. Further, \nanalysis suggests that historically, higher dividend payout ratios have been associated with higher \nearnings growth rates\u2014contrary to what simple theory would say. Taken together, these studies broadly \nsuggest that capital markets tend to reward companies that do not pursue asset growth for the sake of \ngrowth. 8 \n \n"

So companies have the resources available to invest but don\u2019t know \nquite what to do. Uncertainty about the global economy makes executives wary of sizeable capital \nexpenditures and M&A deals. The same uncertainty creates concerns about dividends, because \ncompanies don\u2019t want to enter into an implicit contract that they feel they may not be able to honor in the \nfuture. Share buybacks look attractive but stocks have been on a roller coaster and the ten-year \ncompounded annual return for the S&P 500 has been an abysmal four percent. Executives who \npurchased their company\u2019s stock at higher prices in recent years are also gun-shy about buying back \nstock today in fear that they will again pay too much.   \n        \nThis report looks at buybacks from four distinct points of view: companies, shareholders, prospective \nshareholders, and the media.

      "text": " \n \nPage 6 \n \n      Legg Mason Capital Management \nCompany Management: \n \n\u2022 \nOne of the first concepts to acknowledge with a share buyback is value conservation. Here\u2019s the \nbasic idea: whether a company buys back overvalued stock, undervalued stock, or pays a \ndividend, value is conserved. One group may benefit at the expense of another, but in aggregate \nthe outcome sums to zero. The key issue is how each decision affects ongoing and selling \nshareholders. \n \nExhibit 3 illustrates this point. Assume the sole asset of a company is $1,000 in cash, and that \nthere are 100 shares outstanding. Value per share is $10 ($1,000/100). The company decides it \nwants to return $200 to shareholders. In scenario A, the stock price is at $20, twice the value. The \ncompany goes ahead and repurchases 10 shares for a total cost of $200, leaving 90 shares. In \nthis case, the selling shareholders gained $100 ($20 price - $10 value x 10 shares = $100) and \nthe ongoing shareholders have lost $100 ($8.89 new value - $10 old value x 90 shares = $100). \nSelling shareholders have benefitted at the expense of ongoing shareholders.  \n \nExhibit 3: Demonstration of the Value Conservation Principle \n \nSource: LMCM.

      "text": " \n \nPage 7 \n \n      Legg Mason Capital Management \n \nThe value conservation in each of these scenarios belies a fundamental point: management\u2019s \nobjective should be to maximize the long-term value for ongoing shareholders. Management \nshould be preoccupied with generating the greatest long-term value per share. Building a larger \nentity should not be the goal. Creating value for the continuing shareholders should be. \n \nScenario A should not be confused with buying back the stock, seeing it go down subsequently, \nand assuming that the decision was poor. After all, even highly successful money managers buy \nstocks that underperform. The key is whether, given the information the executives had at the \ntime, the stock traded at a sufficient discount to a reasonable assessment of its intrinsic value. If \nthe process is solid and the conclusion about intrinsic value sound, then a later decline in the \nstock price is not evidence of a bad decision. In reality, however, very few executives think about \nbuybacks properly. \n   \nFor companies that are overcapitalized and have a stock that management deems to be \novervalued, a special dividend is a reasonable alternative. A dividend treats all investors the \nsame and allows investors to reallocate the proceeds as they see fit. Those shareholders who \nthink the shares are undervalued can reinvest their dividend proceeds back into the shares. \n  \n\u2022 \nExecutives should follow the golden rule of share buybacks: A company should repurchase its \nshares only when its stock is trading below its expected value and when no better investment \nopportunities are available. 10 The first part of this rule reinforces the notion that executives should \nseek to maximize value for the ongoing shareholders. The second part of the rule addresses \nprioritization and makes clear that executives should assess the virtue of a buyback against \nalternative investments, including capital spending and M&A. \n \n\u2022 \nBuybacks can be more attractive than investing in the business. Most executives don\u2019t want to \nhear this because they think that their prime responsibility is to grow the business. But the \nobjective of growth can, and often does, come into conflict with the proper objective of maximizing \nlong-term value for ongoing shareholders. In most cases, companies achieve value creation \nthrough operations\u2014investments in the business that earn above the cost of capital. And building \nvalue through operations should remain their top priority. But properly executed buybacks can \nprovide a legitimate and significant lever to build value for ongoing shareholders. \n \n\u2022 \nBuybacks can be more attractive than M&A. Most M&A deals are close to value neutral for the \nbuyer, which means that they earn something close to the cost of capital. The reason is pretty \nsimple: attractive assets typically lure multiple buyers, so most of the value of synergies goes to \nthe sellers than to the buyers. Buybacks offer executives a potential advantage over M&A. In \nM&A, a company must properly forecast the cash flows of the target as an ongoing business and \nthen attempt to pay a premium for control that is less than the present value of synergies. So a \ndeal must clear two hurdles: deliver on the expectations already in the market and deliver on a \npositive spread between the synergies and the premium. It may be easier for an executive to \nassess the cash flows of his own business than the cash flows of an acquisition target. Further, \nwith smart buybacks the company pays no premium\u2014in fact, the company can acquire the \nshares at a discount. \n \n\u2022 \nThere are three basic schools of thought behind buying back stock: \n \no \nFair value school. This school believes that a steady and consistent approach is best. \nOver the span of many years, the company will repurchase shares that are at times \nundervalued, at times overvalued, and often somewhere near the fair value. The attitude \nis that it all works out in the end, and the company returns cash at roughly fair value. \nSince buybacks offer ongoing shareholders more flexibility\u2014they can hold and defer \n"

This school believes that a company should only buy back stock \nwhen the shares are undervalued. If management\u2019s assessment of value is correct, this \napproach rewards ongoing shareholders at the expense of selling shareholders. To \nproperly execute buybacks using this approach, executives must have a good, grounded \nsense of what their company\u2019s stock is worth. Experience indicates that few executives \ncultivate this sense. \n \no \nImpure motives school. Executives in this school buy back shares to achieve goals that \nmay or may not coincide with the economic interests of shareholders (and raise agency \ncosts). These include buying back shares to boost earnings per share (EPS), to offset \ndilution from options or M&A, or to lift the return on equity. 11 The use of buybacks to \nmanipulate EPS is particularly tempting. To be clear, there is no economically sensible \nrationale to buy back stock solely to increase EPS. \n \nWhether a buyback increases or decreases EPS is a function of the price earnings (P/E) \nmultiple and either the company\u2019s foregone after-tax interest income or the after-tax cost \nof new debt to finance the buyback. When the inverse of the P/E, or earnings yield, \n[1/(P/E) = E/P] is greater than the after-tax interest rate, a buyback adds to EPS. When \nthe E/P is lower than the after-tax rate, a buyback reduces EPS. Management should \nview the EPS impact of a buyback as a residual, not as a source of motivation. \n    \no \nAssuming a process through which management can distinguish between an \nundervalued and overvalued stock, the intrinsic value school is best. The actions of \nexecutives in the intrinsic value school provide a useful signal to investors as to when \nthose executives think the stock is cheap or dear. The fair value school is tolerable if \nmanagement articulates its strategy and executes it consistently. 12 There is major risk in \nthe impure motives school and, unfortunately, this is the school of thought to which most \ncompanies subscribe. \n \n\u2022 \nThe shareholder rate of return\u2014the return that continuing shareholders can expect\u2014equals the \ncost of equity divided by the ratio of stock price to intrinsic value. For example, say a stock is \ntrading at $50, management\u2019s thoughtful analysis suggests that it is worth $75, and the cost of \nequity is 8 percent. The expected return from the buyback is 12 percent [8%/($50/$75)]. A more \nsophisticated approach incorporates both the discount to intrinsic value and the time it takes for \nthe value gap to close. But even this simple approach provides management with a reasonable \nbasis to compare the returns from a buyback to other alternatives. \n \n\u2022 \nA number of companies are sitting on enormous cash balances. For example, tech giants Apple, \nCisco Systems, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Qualcomm have between them $282 \nbillion in net cash, which represents more than 20 percent of their combined market \ncapitalizations. 13 However, of the $1.7 trillion in aggregate liquid assets in U.S. nonfinancial \ncompanies, over $1 trillion is outside of the U.S. This means that companies must repatriate the \ncash and pay taxes before they can use the funds for dividends or share buybacks. The tax rate \nthey have to pay is the difference between U.S. taxes and what the company paid in the local \njurisdiction. Research shows that companies that face high taxes are more likely to hold cash \nbalances. 14  \n \nAs a result, some companies have been seeking to make acquisitions, or other investments, \noverseas in order to deploy capital without generating a tax bill. Recent examples include \nHewlett-Packard\u2019s acquisition of Autonomy for $11.7 billion and Microsoft\u2019s purchase of Skype for \n$8.5 billion. 15 The risk, from the standpoint of shareholders, is clear: managers may find \n"

      "text": " \n \nPage 10 \n \n      Legg Mason Capital Management \nShareholders: \n \n\u2022 \nHere\u2019s a very basic question: If you own the shares of a company because you believe the stock \nis undervalued, why would you ever want the company to pay a dividend instead of buying back \nshares? If you believe the shares are undervalued then you should always favor a buyback \nbecause buybacks add value for continuing shareholders at the expense of selling shareholders. \nAs Warren Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 1984 annual report, \u201cWhen companies with \noutstanding businesses and comfortable financial positions find their shares selling far below \nintrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action can benefit shareholders as surely as \nrepurchases.\u201d 16 Perhaps the final phrase would be more accurate if it read, \u201cno alternative action \ncan benefit ongoing shareholders as surely as repurchases.\u201d \n \n\u2022 \nIf the company of a stock that you own is buying back shares, you must recognize that doing \nnothing is doing something\u2014increasing your percentage ownership in the company. As a \nconsequence, if you are a longstanding shareholder it is inappropriate to criticize management for \nhaving bought back stock at a higher price. Provided that management used a proper process to \nassess the merit of the buyback, they have come to the same conclusion as you have (assuming \nthat you own the shares because you think they are undervalued). Companies and investors \nhave to make decisions in the face of incomplete information and uncertainty. \n \n\u2022 \nEncourage the companies you own to adhere to the golden rule of buybacks: A company should \nrepurchase its shares only when its stock is trading below its expected value and when no better \ninvestment opportunities are available. Most executives think in terms of \u201cgrowth versus no-\ngrowth\u201d rather than \u201cvalue creation versus value destruction.\u201d There are times when repurchasing \nshares is more attractive than investing in the business. \n \n\u2022 \nShareholders who want a dividend can simply create one by selling a pro-rated amount of stock. \nAs with a normal cash dividend, a synthetic dividend leaves the shareholder with cash and the \nsame proportionate ownership of the company. Buybacks are generally more favorable than a \ndividend because there is no reinvestment risk and little friction. A synthetic dividend is a good \nsolution for shareholders who want cash for current consumption. \n \n\u2022 \nInvestors frequently use past total shareholder return (TSR) as a guide to anticipate future \nreturns. Here\u2019s a simple formula to calculate TSR, where g is the annual rate of price appreciation \nand d is the dividend yield: \n \no \nTSR = g + d(1+g) \n \nThe problem is that with stocks that pay dividends, almost no investors earn the total shareholder \nreturn. This is because dividends are often taxable and generally don\u2019t get reinvested back into \nthe stock (either because of consumption or because the dividends are allocated to other \ninvestments). Said differently, a shareholder only earns the TSR if he automatically reinvests 100 \npercent of his dividends back into the stock in a tax-free account, which rarely happens. 17 In \ncontrast, companies that return cash to shareholders via buybacks allow their ongoing \nshareholders to earn the TSR. \n   \n\u2022 \nShareholders seek to buy the shares of companies when the price in the market is well below the \nvalue. The larger the discount between value and price, the higher the expected return to \nshareholders (all else being equal) as the market closes the gap between the two. Provided a \nshareholder is right in his assessment of price and value, he should always prefer a buyback to a \ndividend because a buyback increases the value per share for continuing shareholders.    \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nPage 11 \n \n      Legg Mason Capital Management \nProspective Shareholders: \n \n\u2022 \nStep one as a prospective shareholder is figuring out whether there\u2019s a gap between price and \nvalue. Integral to that decision is an assessment of management. And all roads to managerial \nevaluation lead back to capital allocation: financial capital, physical capital, and human capital. \nThe interplay between incentives and capital allocation is important, but the guiding principles of \nmanagement are probably most important.  \n \nThe value of a company\u2019s stock is the present value of the cash the business will generate \nthroughout its life. A company must ultimately provide its owners cash in order to have value. \nThat cash can come in the form of dividends, share buybacks, or a sale of the company. While \nmanagement\u2019s first and foremost priority is building value through operations, a thoughtful \napproach to returning cash to shareholders can add meaningful value. \n  \n\u2022 \nAssess whether the company is following the golden rule of buybacks: A company should \nrepurchase its shares only when its stock is trading below its expected value and when no better \ninvestment opportunities are available. Analyze the results of the company\u2019s capital allocation \nchoices and spend time understanding the process by which they make their choices. As in any \nfield filled with uncertainty, a focus on process is more revealing than observing short-term \noutcomes. If the company did buy back stock, assess their motivation. Did they do it for the right \nreasons? \n \n\u2022 \nNote the evidence that shows that companies that reduce asset growth via dividend initiations, \nbuybacks, and spinoffs generate better shareholder returns than companies that grow their \ncapital bases rapidly. Judge whether there is sufficient evidence of capital deployment discipline. \nFurther, the research shows that companies that return cash actually grow faster than the \naverage of all companies. \n \n\u2022 \nAnalyze the company\u2019s capital structure and ask whether it\u2019s overcapitalized. As noted earlier, \ncash balances today are very high and free cash flow generation remains strong. Develop an \ninformed view of how management is likely to deploy the capital. Will the funds be returned to \nshareholders opportunistically? Will the company chase growth? Will the firm allow the cash to sit \non the balance sheet, creating an option?   \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nPage 12 \n \n      Legg Mason Capital Management \nMedia: \n \n\u2022 \nMost members of the media have little or no training in finance. The problem arises when \nmembers of the media comment on how attractive or unattractive a buyback is based on faulty \nfacts or thinking. Unfortunately, there is a good deal of this type of exposition. \n  \n\u2022 \nFirst things first: A company that bought back stock at a price that is higher than its current price \nhas not committed a sin if the decision-making process was proper. A process is proper if the \ncompany thoughtfully assessed its value using the facts and information it had at the time and \ndeemed the price to be below that value. Now, the fact is that most executives always think that \ntheir stock is undervalued, and so their motivation to buy may not be proper. But the point is that \njust because a stock has fallen subsequent to a buyback does not mean it was a poor decision. \n \nAs we saw earlier, value is conserved. It\u2019s just that the selling and ongoing shareholders are \ntreated differently. Here\u2019s a related question to contemplate: Would you give a company a hard \ntime if it paid out a dividend when the stock was higher? Unlikely.  \n \n\u2022 \nStop with the canard that investors deem buybacks to be good because they increase earnings \nper share (EPS) by dividing profits by a smaller number of shares. Here\u2019s a typical quotation: \n\u201cBuybacks serve some useful purposes. Reducing the outstanding stock can help a company \nboost per-share earnings, as the profit is divided by fewer shares.\u201d 18 This is not even \narithmetically true, much less economically valid. As seen earlier, the EPS impact of a buyback is \na function of the interest rate (either foregone interest income on cash deployed to buy back \nshares or the interest expense assumed to borrow to buy shares) and the reciprocal of the P/E \nmultiple, or earnings yield. The EPS effect is separate from the economic effect. \n  \n\u2022 \nReturning capital to investors is vital, and redeployment of capital is an essential function of the \ncapital markets. While many investors rely on agents to invest on their behalf (e.g., mutual funds, \nhedge funds), redeploying capital from low-return to high-return opportunities is crucial to the \nlong-term health of the economy, and buybacks can be a very efficient way to achieve that goal. \n \n\u2022 \nShare buybacks should not be derisively called \u201cfinancial engineering.\u201d If done properly, they are \na thoughtful and effective means to return capital to owners. Some companies may pursue \nbuybacks for the wrong reasons, including boosting the stock price or offsetting dilution from \ncompensation programs, but the evidence shows that such moves have little or no lasting \neffects.19 \n \n"
