A distinguished professor and past \npresident of the Santa Fe Institute, West and his collaborators \nexplained previously unexplained empirical phenomenon.1  \nThe most famous of these is the eponymous law developed by a \nbiologist named Max Kleiber.2 In exhibit 1, which depicts the law, \nthe x-axis is an animal\u2019s body mass, measured on a logarithmic \nscale. (Instead of 1, 2, 3, the scale is 1, 10, 100 so that the \npercentage difference between the points is the same.) The y-axis, \nalso on a logarithmic scale, measures the animal\u2019s metabolic rate, \nor energy used per unit of time. Kleiber\u2019s law is the observation that \nthe outcome of the plot is a straight line with a slope, or rise over \nrun, of three-fourths (\u00be). This is a classic example of a power law. \nAs West explains, \u201cthe slope of the graph is just the exponent of \nthe power law.\u201d3 \nSimply stated, West and his research partners used math to show \nthat the relationship is the result of how energy is dissipated \nthrough a network.4 Evolution figured out the optimal network \nstructure to feed all of the cells in the body, which applies to a \nmouse as it does to an elephant. Nature is amazing.   \nThe principles behind these networks explain other features of the \nsystems, including the rate of blood flow, the number of heartbeats, \nlongevity, and growth. Some of these scaling laws apply to social \nsystems as well, including cities and companies.5  \nOur focus is on growth. We are all familiar with physical growth, as \nwe ourselves grew and we watch the growth of others. But have \nyou ever wondered why you stopped growing? Indeed, other living \nthings, including certain trees, fish, and plants, grow until they die. \nSince you continue to provide your body with energy through \nnourishment, why did you reach a point of maturity and stop \ngrowing taller? \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n6292016 Exp. 1/31/2025 \n3 \n \nIn this report, we suggest that a similar framework is relevant for understanding corporate growth. Indeed, West \nand another group of colleagues have derived a universal growth curve for companies.8 Instead of energy, the \ninput is financial capital. But the allocation between growth and maintenance is the same.  \nThis topic is important because you can anticipate a company\u2019s growth only if you understand how much capital \nthe company spends on growth versus maintenance. A company\u2019s prospects for growth may be dimmer than \nyou believe if it is spending more on maintenance than you think. In Lewis Carroll\u2019s novel, Through the Looking-\nGlass, the Red Queen says, \u201cNow, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. \nIf you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\u201d9 Estimating maintenance capital \nexpenditures provides insight into how fast a company has to run just to stay in place.  \nThe distinction between growth and maintenance spending is complicated by the role of inflation and \ntechnological obsolescence. When prices are rising, capital expenditures will exceed depreciation even when \nthe business is stable because new capital expenditures reflect inflation while depreciation is based on historical \ncosts. In the case of falling prices, or deflation, capital expenditures get cheaper over time and depreciation can \noverstate maintenance costs. Think of products that have benefitted from Moore\u2019s Law, which suggests the cost \nof computing declines over time. Sometimes first movers have to spend more than followers do.10  \nTechnological obsolescence creates the risk that a company overestimates an asset\u2019s useful life. For example, \nthe costs for companies in certain industries addressing climate change, or for automobile manufacturers \nmigrating from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, are potentially massive. These costs are \nnecessary to maintain market position, sales, and competitiveness.  \nIn the cases of inflation or obsolescence, less investment will go toward growth and more will be required to \nmaintain current operations.  \nInvestment spending for growth is not limited to tangible assets but also includes non-physical intangible assets. \nToday, total intangible investments exceed tangible ones and accounting for them is very challenging. For \nexample, a young company\u2019s sales and marketing budget is often dedicated primarily to acquiring new \ncustomers, but as the business matures that expense is split between growth spending to acquire new \ncustomers and maintenance spending to retain customers.  \nThe data suggest two stories of growth. For tangible assets, depreciation tends to understate maintenance \ncapital expenditures. The tangible part of the economy is on average mature, with capital expenditures as a \npercentage of sales flat to down for the last three decades. This is important because recent research shows \nthat firms that underestimate their maintenance investments \u201cexperience future write-offs and negative future \nearnings\u201d and are associated with \u201csignificantly negative future abnormal stock returns.\u201d11 \nThe intangible part of the economy appears to be younger. Intangible selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) \ninvestments as a percentage of sales have risen steadily over the last three decades, with some acceleration in \ngrowth since the turn of the century (see exhibit 3). This is relevant because firms with high intangibles grow \nfaster, on average, than firms with low intangibles but also have a higher standard deviation of growth.12 \nAcademics studying this issue found that buying firms with high intangibles and shorting those with low \nintangibles generated an average annual return of 4.6 percentage points from June 1989 to November 2020.13  \n \n \n"

FactSet. \nNote: Intangible SG&A investments and capital expenditures reflect the Russell 3000 excluding the financial and real \nestate sectors; Intangible investments=R&D + Advertising + Investment Main SG&A.  \nAccounting for Growth \nLet\u2019s start with a simple case before we introduce complexity.14 Assume a company needs four machines with \na useful life of four years each to run its operations. The sales for the company are in a steady state, the ages \nof the machines are staggered (new, one-year old, etc.), the machines have no salvage value, and the company \nuses straight-line depreciation. At the end of each year, the company spends $80,000 to replace the machine \nat the end of its life and there is no inflation. Capital expenditures and the depreciation for each year are $80,000.  \nFree cash flow, the number we project and discount in a discounted-cash flow model, is typically defined as net \noperating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus investment in future growth (I). Investment in future growth captures \nchanges in net working capital, as companies often need to increase their working capital as they grow, and \ncapital expenditures net of depreciation. The simplifying assumption is that depreciation is a reasonable proxy \nfor maintenance capital spending and that investment in excess of depreciation is allocated to growth.    \nThe analytical issue we need to address is whether depreciation is in fact a decent proxy for maintenance capital \nexpenditures and the ramifications if it misses the mark. Appendix A examines whether companies themselves \nknow the level of maintenance capital spending.  \nHow do we know if a company\u2019s depreciation understates its maintenance capital spending? Venkat Peddireddy, \nan assistant professor of accounting at China Europe International Business School, created a method to do \nthis. He calculates \u201ccumulative capacity cost,\u201d a measure of maintenance spending, as the sum of depreciation \nand amortization (D&A), asset write-downs, loss on the sale of assets, goodwill impairment, and intangible asset \nimpairments over a five-year period. This calculation considers both normal wear and tear via depreciation as \nwell as write-downs or losses that might be related to technological obsolescence.  \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\nPercentage of Sales\nIntangible SG&A \nInvestments\nCapital \nExpenditures\n"

That ratio provides \nan estimate of the cost of assets required to generate a dollar\u2019s worth of sales. Multiplying that ratio by current \nyear sales yields a measure of maintenance capital expenditures.  \nPeddireddy tests this on all companies of a sufficient size from 1974 through 2016 and includes nearly all \nindustries. These companies follow U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. He finds that in the \naggregate, maintenance capital expenditures exceed D&A by about 20 percent (see exhibit 4). Appendix B \nshows that there is substantial variance in this percentage by industry, and you can infer that there are additional \ndifferences for individual companies within the industries.  \nThat maintenance capital expenditures surpass D&A means that less capital is going toward investment than \nmany investors think. He attributes this understatement of D&A to technological obsolescence. Inflation has the \nsame effect and deflation has the opposite effect.15   \nExhibit 4: Amount That Maintenance Capital Expenditures Exceed D&A, 1974-2016 \n \nSource: Venkat Ramana Reddy Peddireddy, \u201cEstimating Maintenance CapEx,\u201d PhD Thesis\u2014Columbia University, 2021.  \nHere\u2019s a simple example of how this might work. Let\u2019s say a company bought a machine and assumed a useful \nlife of four years. But after three years the company realizes, as the result of technological obsolescence, that \nthe machine no longer has value. The company will take an asset write-down to reflect that reality, and it is clear \nthat the depreciation understated the asset\u2019s useful life and hence maintenance capital spending. \nSorting growth versus maintenance spending is essential and Peddireddy\u2019s analysis provides a framework for \nconsidering the issues. It also shows that the breakdown between growth and maintenance matters for total \nshareholder returns. But his approach fails to capture a few issues that are relevant to the overall results and \nimportant for investors. \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1974\n1977\n1980\n1983\n1986\n1989\n1992\n1995\n1998\n2001\n2004\n2007\n2010\n2013\n2016\nMedian Underdepreciation (Percent)\nRecession\nUnder-\ndepreciation\n"

All rights reserved. \n6292016 Exp. 1/31/2025 \n6 \n \nLimitations of the Approach \nThe first limitation is a potential asymmetry in what the data capture. Companies that overstate the useful lives \nof their assets will need to write them down. But this analysis won\u2019t reflect situations when companies understate \nthe useful lives of their assets. In effect, these companies get the free use of an asset after it has been \ndepreciated fully. \nTo be clear, companies that understate the useful lives of assets are much rarer than those that overstate them, \nif for no other reason than a longer assumed asset life leads to higher short-term earnings. But it is nonetheless \na consideration.  \nFor example, Amazon, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), and Microsoft all recently changed their \nestimates of the useful life of their servers from three to four years. Here\u2019s the paragraph from Amazon\u2019s Form \n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 that describes the change:16   \n\u201cWe review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2020 we changed \nour estimate of the useful life for our servers from three years to four years. The longer useful life is due \nto continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this \nchange . . . was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 billion and an increase in \nnet income of $2.0 billion.\u201d \nTo put this in context, Amazon\u2019s net income was $21.3 billion in 2020. That means we can attribute just under \n10 percent of the company\u2019s earnings to this accounting change. The adjustment boosted Alphabet\u2019s and \nMicrosoft\u2019s earnings by more than $2 billion each in fiscal 2021.17  \nThis approach also struggles to capture how the evolution of accounting rules, especially those related to \nmergers and acquisitions (M&A), can affect the numbers. Peddireddy\u2019s analysis covers more than four decades, \nand during that period there have been a lot of changes in how companies can account for M&A. For example, \nprior to 2001 companies could use either the purchase or pooling-of-interests method. With purchase \naccounting, any premium to book value was recorded as goodwill and then amortized over a period of up to 40 \nyears. With pooling, the two companies simply combined their balance sheets. \nIn 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards No. 141, which got rid \nof pooling-of-interests. It also replaced the amortization of goodwill with an annual goodwill impairment test. As \na result, amortization as a percentage of depreciation and amortization plummeted from 22 percent in 2001 to \nabout 10 percent in 2002 (see exhibit 5).  \nThis is relevant because it changes the calculation of the cumulative capacity cost. Before the accounting \nchange, a company that made an acquisition using purchase accounting would have to amortize the goodwill it \nrecorded on its balance sheet. After the accounting change, the same company doing the same deal would not \nhave to amortize the goodwill. The cumulative capacity cost, which includes amortization, would therefore be \nlower assuming no impairment.  \n \n \n \n \n"

All of this was aided by lots of M&A. \nThe final limitation is the biggest, by far, and deserves a separate discussion. \nThe Rise of Intangibles: How Do We Sort Investment from Maintenance Spending? \nThe global economy has shifted from one relying primarily on tangible investments to one that is based on \nintangible assets. As recently as the 1970s, tangible investments in the U.S. were twice as large as intangible \ninvestments. Today, that ratio has flipped. For example, we estimate that companies in the Russell 3000 \nexpensed $1.8 trillion for intangible investments in 2020, more than double their capital expenditures of $800 \nbillion. These and the following figures exclude the financial and real estate sectors. \nThe formula for growth is the same as for tangible assets. Companies spend on intangible assets and the money \nis allocated between growth and maintenance.20 A simple but important case in point is spending on research \nand development (R&D). Many academics and practitioners assume that R&D is a discretionary investment, \nwhich means that it is all about growth and has nothing to do with maintenance.  \nBut professors who examined the issue carefully concluded that a meaningful percentage of R&D spending, \nespecially for large digital technology companies, is in fact necessary just to maintain the current operations.21 \nUnderstanding this ratio for R&D as well as for other categories of intangible investment is essential to assessing \na company\u2019s prospects.  \nWhile Peddireddy\u2019s analysis is solid for tangible assets, the task is a lot more difficult for intangible assets \nbecause of the inconsistent way they are treated by accountants. Specifically, organic intangible investment and \nmaintenance spending are expensed on the income statement. Acquired intangible assets are recorded on the \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\nPercent\n"

The assets \nof Company B are a number of machines with specified useful lives and a list of customers who subscribe to a \nservice. \nCompany A records the machines as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) on its balance sheet and \ndepreciates the assets on the income statement over their useful lives. Future growth and maintenance spending \nare also capitalized. Depreciation is a solid proxy for maintenance capital spending if it matches the useful lives \nof the machines. If, on the other hand, technological obsolescence means that the useful lives are less than the \ndepreciation schedule suggests, Company A will eventually have to write down the assets. Peddireddy\u2019s \napproach provides valuable insight for physical assets.   \nBut things are different for the customer list. Company A posts the acquired list as an intangible asset on the \nbalance sheet and amortizes it over its estimated useful life. But it expenses the money it spends to maintain \nand grow the list on the income statement within SG&A. This is why we use earnings before interest, taxes, and \namortization of acquired intangibles (EBITA), rather than earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), when we \ncalculate NOPAT. The appearance of the customer list on the balance sheet is a one-time event as a result of \nthe acquisition, and spending for future maintenance and growth reverts to the income statement.  \nExhibit 6 shines a spotlight on these issues by providing some estimates for the Russell 3000 in 2020.

These assets show up on the income statement in the form of depreciation \nexpense (upper left quadrant). Depreciation is the result of the matching principle in accounting that requires \nsales and related expenses to be matched during a period.  \nCompanies commonly report their results using straight-line depreciation, which spreads the expense of an \nasset evenly over its useful life. For example, a company that spends $500 to buy a machine with a useful life \nof 5 years would recognize a depreciation expense of $100 per year for 5 years. Total depreciation for companies \nin the Russell 3000 was about $700 billion in 2020. \nCapital expenditures are added to gross PP&E on the balance sheet and are then depreciated over time (lower \nleft quadrant). Net PP&E is gross PP&E minus accumulated depreciation. Total net PP&E for companies in the \nRussell 3000 was $6.7 trillion in 2020.  \nWe now turn to intangible assets. We estimate that for companies in the Russell 3000, $1.8 trillion of total SG&A \nexpense was in the form of intangible investments in 2020 (upper right quadrant). Further, the amortization of \nacquired intangibles was almost $200 billion. Acquired intangibles are amortized in the same fashion that capital \nexpenditures are depreciated.  \nFinally, intangible assets are reflected on the balance sheet following an acquisition (lower right quadrant). \nAccountants identify an item as an intangible asset if it meets one of two criteria. The first is that it arises from \ncontractual or other legal rights. The second is that it can be separated or divided from the company.22 Acquired \nintangible assets have averaged about one-third of M&A deal value in recent years.23 \nAssets acquired that don\u2019t meet those criteria are recorded as goodwill, which is effectively the purchase price \nof the deal minus the fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities. Goodwill \nrepresents future economic benefits from acquired assets that are not individually identified and separately \nrecognized. We estimate that acquired intangible assets with definite lives were $1.15 trillion for companies in \nthe Russell 3000 at year-end 2020, and that acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives were about the same \namount. Goodwill was $3.8 trillion.24  \nJust as an investor must think about growth and maintenance capital expenditures, he or she must also assess \ninvestment versus maintenance SG&A expense. This difficult challenge was addressed by two professors of \naccounting, Luminita Enache and Anup Srivastava, in their appropriately-named paper, \u201cShould Intangible \nInvestments Be Reported Separately or Commingled with Operating Expenses? New Evidence.\u201d25 The answer \nis, \u201cYes, intangible investments should be reported separately,\u201d and the authors provide a method to do so. \nThey start by separating SG&A into two parts: the sum of research and development (R&D) and advertising, \nwhich are deemed to be intangible investments, and what they call \u201cMain SG&A.\u201d In turn, they split Main SG&A \ninto \u201cMaintenance Main SG&A\u201d and \u201cInvestment Main SG&A.\u201d Maintenance Main SG&A expenses support \nexisting operations and are calculated by matching them with current revenues. Examples include rent for offices \nand distribution centers, delivery costs, and sales commissions.  \nWhat\u2019s left over is called \u201cInvestment Main SG&A,\u201d and is considered discretionary spending that is the source \nof future earnings. Maintenance Main SG&A is what a company has to spend to stay in place and Investment \nMain SG&A is what the company spends to pursue value-creating growth. \nExhibit 7 provides our estimates, guided by Enache and Srivastava\u2019s approach, for companies in the Russell \n3000 from 1984 through 2020. Intangible investments are the sum of R&D, advertising, and Investment Main \nSG&A. Maintenance SG&A is simply Maintenance Main SG&A. In Appendix C we show how to estimate growth \nand maintenance spending for a specific company using a related approach. Microsoft is our case study.   \n"

The slope of the growth trajectory for intangible investments steepened following the \nfinancial crisis of 2008-2009. In 2020, we estimate that R&D was about one-quarter of total intangible investment. \nMaintenance SG&A was $800 billion in the same year.  \nThe contrast between tangible and intangible investments is instructive. As companies age, capital spending \ntends to shift from growth to maintenance. Peddireddy\u2019s work suggests that depreciation expense understates \nmaintenance capital spending, which means there is less money left over to support growth. It also implies that \nearnings are overstated. \nBut companies appear young based on the sharp rise in intangible investment. A substantial and growing fraction \nof SG&A spending is going to support growth. We see this in the aggregate data as well.26 The exercise of \ncapitalizing intangible investments and amortizing them suggests that reported earnings are understated.27 \nConclusion \nBoiled down to the basics, a business invests money with the expectation of earning a satisfactory return on \ninvestment. Accounting is the language of business and provides information about a company\u2019s profits, financial \nposition, and cash flows. All stakeholders, including executives, shareholders, and lenders, rely to some degree \non accounting figures to understand a business and to get a sense of its prospects. \nThe key is that SG&A and capital expenditures have an investment component that drives future earnings growth \nand a maintenance component that is necessary to sustain the current operations. Work by Geoffrey West and \nhis colleagues shows that many organisms, including mammals, follow a trajectory called \u201cdeterminate\u201d growth. \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n1,800\n2,000\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\n$ Billions\nIntangible\nInvestments\nMaintenance\nSG&A\n"

Growth stops at the point that \nmaintenance needs consume all of the incoming energy. Companies appear to follow a similar pattern.  \nGetting a handle on growth versus maintenance spending is essential for executives and investors. But the truth \nis few actually have a clear sense of the figures. Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor of accounting at Columbia \nBusiness School, ponders, \u201cI wonder how many [chief financial officers] CFOs even know their maintenance \ncapex number. Asking that question, especially for intangibles such as R&D and certain aspects of SG&A, is \neven trickier.\u201d28 He is right.    \nWe believe that there are two big steps in the correct direction. The first is to get a better fix on maintenance \ncapital expenditures. Recent work by Peddireddy and others suggests that depreciation understates \nmaintenance capital expenditures, although the mismatch is different by industry and company. \nThe second is an estimate of what part of SG&A is an investment and what is required to sustain current \noperations. The task is complicated by the fact that most intangible assets are reflected on the balance sheet \nonly following M&A. And even in cases where intangible assets do appear on the balance sheet, the spending \nto maintain the value of those assets is again part of the SG&A expense. \nThe data suggest a noteworthy difference between tangible and intangible investment. Tangible investment, as \nmeasured as a percentage of sales, has been flat to down in recent decades, and depreciation often understates \nmaintenance capital spending. One of Peddireddy\u2019s important results is that the understatement of maintenance \ncapital spending is linked to future write-offs and poor relative stock price returns.  \nIntangible investment has been up sharply in recent decades. The maintenance component of intangible \ninvestment has risen as well. For example, you should deem a reasonable percentage of R&D spending for \nlarge technology companies to be maintenance spending. But on balance more intangible investment is funding \ngrowth. Intangible-intensive companies grow faster on average and generate higher shareholder returns than \ntangible-intensive companies.   \nThe goal of this discussion is to think about how resources translate into growth. In general, companies and \ninvestors should think about the split between growth and maintenance spending in the context of a life cycle. \nEarly on, resources are skewed toward growth and they shift to maintenance later on. As a result, larger \ncompanies grow more slowly than smaller companies do on average.29 \nMost executives and investors likely underestimate maintenance spending as the result of inflation and \ntechnological obsolescence. A company with a competitor that has spent the money to provide a better good or \nservice has little choice but to match the competitor\u2019s outlays. Further, technology companies constantly develop \nnew versions of their products, with some of the cost allocated to R&D.  \n \n"

Companies have a sense of the cost to acquire reserves, either through exploration or acquisition, \nwhich is then deemed to be maintenance capital spending.  \nNote that maintenance spending in the energy industry is pegged to production, not sales.

All rights reserved. \n6292016 Exp. 1/31/2025 \n14 \n \nAppendix C: Calculating Investment and Maintenance Spending for Microsoft \nA simple way of explaining how Venkat Peddireddy estimates maintenance capital spending is that he starts \nwith depreciation and amortization (D&A). If accurate, D&A allows you to measure the useful lives of assets and \nhence maintenance capital spending. He then adds write-downs, losses on asset sales, and impairment of \ngoodwill and intangible assets to see if the company correctly specified the lives of its assets. A write-down of a \ndepreciable or amortizable asset indicates that a company spent more on maintenance capital investment than \nits D&A indicated. It also means that earnings were overstated. \nBruce Greenwald, a professor emeritus of finance and asset management at Columbia Business School, and \nhis co-authors provide another approach to estimate maintenance capital expenditures.31 Here we explain and \nexpand on the core of his methodology and use Microsoft as a case study.  \nGreenwald starts by acknowledging that capital expenditures should be separated into growth and maintenance \noutlays. He follows with the premise that there is a stable relationship between the level of net PP&E and sales. \nHe then calculates the five-year average ratio of net PP&E-to-sales. To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that ratio comes \nout to 30 percent. \nNext, he calculates growth capital expenditures by multiplying this ratio of net PP&E-to-sales by the dollar \nchange in sales in the most recent period. To continue with our example, we\u2019ll say that sales increased by $200. \nGrowth capital expenditures would be $60 (.30 x $200). \nFinally, we solve for maintenance capital expenditures by taking the difference between total capital \nexpenditures and growth capital expenditures. To finish our example, we\u2019ll assume that total capital expenditures \nare $150. Total capital expenditures of $150 minus growth capital expenditures of $60 equals maintenance \ncapital expenditures of $90 ($150 - $60 = $90). \nThis is a good time to pause and reiterate the pattern of growth most companies go through. Young companies \ngrow faster on average than old companies do. Eventually growth flattens out and approaches the level of the \noverall economy. As growth peters out, the product of beginning year sales and the growth rate yields more \nmodest dollar increases in sales. This means the mix shifts from growth to maintenance spending over time.32  \nOne shortcoming of both Peddireddy\u2019s and Greenwald\u2019s analyses is that they don\u2019t properly account for \nintangible investments.33 We now do an analysis for tangible and intangible investments and combine them to \ncome up with an aggregate investment figure. We then calculate the ratio of assets-to-sales and estimate growth \nand maintenance investment spending.  \nGrowth can result from internal investments as well as from external acquisitions. In the aggregate, companies \nspend more on mergers and acquisitions than they do on either tangible or intangible investments. To reflect \nthis, we include Microsoft\u2019s acquisitions and allocate the deal value between tangible and intangible investment \nbased on the company\u2019s disclosures.  \nLet\u2019s start with tangible capital. Here we include net PP&E and leases in the asset base, and our tangible \ninvestment number includes traditional capital expenditures, assets acquired under capital leases, and tangible \nassets from M&A.34 Microsoft\u2019s ratio of net tangible assets to sales averaged 36 percent over the last 5 years, \nbut you can see the ratio is increasing as the company commits resources to the cloud business. By this \ncalculation, maintenance tangible investment has averaged a little more than two-thirds of the total tangible \ninvestment.  \n"

In fact, Microsoft is best known as a software company, which means its \ninvestments are mostly intangible. We need to introduce intangible investment. \nThe challenge is to extract intangible investment from the SG&A expense on the income statement. Judgment \nis required about which items within SG&A we should treat as an investment as well as the useful lives of those \ninvestments. The basic way to think about it is that some percentage of SG&A expense is necessary to maintain \nthe current operations and the rest is discretionary in pursuit of value-creating growth.  \nCharles Hulten, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Maryland, wrote a paper about Microsoft \nthat allocates SG&A to investment and offers useful lives for those assets.35 We use Hulten\u2019s figures to capitalize \na percentage of Microsoft\u2019s SG&A.  \nThis allows us to do a calculation that is similar to that for physical assets. Intangible assets are capitalized on \nthe balance sheet and amortized over time. This leaves us with net capitalized intangibles, which is the intangible \nequivalent to net PP&E. Note that in fiscal 2021, we estimate that intangible investments were $43 billion versus \n$24 billion in tangible investments.  \nNot surprisingly, most of the value is in intangibles. This means that we need to include acquired intangibles and \ngoodwill from the balance sheet to make net intangible investment fully correspond to net PP&E. \nAfter making these adjustments, we can see that the ratio of net capitalized intangibles to sales averaged 96 \npercent over the last 5 years, although the ratio is decreasing. By this calculation, maintenance intangible \ninvestment has averaged about 55 percent of total investment and 20 percent of sales. \n    \nNet Capitalized \nIntangible Assets / Sales \n \nIntangible Investments \n \nFiscal \nYear \nAnnual \n5-Year \nAverage \nChange in \nSales \nGrowth  \nMaintenance \nTotal \nMaintenance Intangible \nInvestments / Sales \n2017 \n110% \n94% \n11,321 \n10,674 \n38,826 \n49,501 \n40% \n2018 \n99% \n96% \n14,159 \n13,629 \n14,276 \n27,905 \n13% \n2019 \n96% \n97% \n15,327 \n14,823 \n22,543 \n37,366 \n18% \n2020 \n90% \n98% \n17,513 \n17,128 \n16,882 \n34,010 \n12% \n2021 \n85% \n96% \n25,073 \n24,078 \n19,178 \n43,256 \n11% \nSource: Microsoft and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Dollar amounts are in millions. \n"

The first edition of the book that offered this approach to estimating maintenance \ncapital expenditures was published in 2001. At that time, intangible and tangible investment was about \nequivalent (see exhibit 7). But the subsequent sharp growth in intangible investment means that failing to include \nit severely limits the insight the analysis can provide.  \nIncluding acquisitions in the estimates is also essential. Many companies rely heavily on acquisitions to sustain \nor grow their sales, and M&A is a large component of total capital allocation. Companies commonly provide \ndetails on how they recorded the tangible and intangible assets on the balance sheet.  \nFinally, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to consider the impact that write-downs have on the estimate of maintenance \nspending when you use the Greenwald approach. We illustrate the point with net tangible assets but the logic \napplies to capitalized intangible assets as well. An asset write-down reduces net tangible assets and therefore \nthe ratio of net tangible assets to sales. A lower percentage applied to the change in the dollar amount of sales \n"
