In fact, improved physical capital management has\nfreed roughly $245 billion over the past decade. However, measures of im-\nproved physical capital management are offset by a surge in goodwill. Cash\nis investing\u2019s common denominator. Given that our accounting system is poor\nat capturing intellectual capital, investors must focus on the source of value\ncreation: cash. There is a substantial and growing chasm between our ac-\ncounting system and economic reality. Analysis of cash flow shrinks that gap,\nand allows investors to judge all companies on a universal and proven metric\nof performance.\n\u2022 \nThe cash conversion cycle is a powerful tool. We find that the cash conver-\nsion cycle is an excellent measure of how well management is employing its\ntangible capital base. In effect, an improving cash conversion cycle is often a\ntriumph of brains over brawn\u2014intellectual capital over physical capital.\n\u2022 \nCash flow: out with the old, in with the new. Our data show that new economy\nindustries\u2014including technology and communications services\u2014are improv-\ning their capital management better than old economy industries such as ba-\nsic materials and energy. Further, companies closest to the customer tend to\ndo a better job of managing capital than those removed from the end market.\n\u2022 \nA stock picker\u2019s delight. The cash conversion cycle is a great tool for growth\nand value investors to identify promise or trouble in their stock picks. Rising\ncash conversion cycles often indicate deterioration in cash flows, while de-\nclining cash conversion cycles generally signal improving cash flows. Neither\nrising nor falling cash conversion cycles are readily apparent from the income\nstatement. Thus, changing cash conversion cycles are often a harbinger of\nstock price performance.\n"

What we need is a way to meas-\nure the knowledge we bring to the work we do.\u201d\n-Walter Wriston\n1\nThroughout most of history, our economy has centered on the production of tan-\ngible goods using physical assets. However, the economy is undergoing a fun-\ndamental shift. A new economy is emerging, where reliance on tangible capital is\nyielding to intellectual capital\u2013from atoms to bits. Intellectual capital is intellectual\nmaterial\u2014knowledge, information, intellectual property, and experience\u2014that can\nbe put to use to create wealth.\n2\nThis atoms-to-bits transformation has not only spawned whole new businesses, it\nis reshaping the competitive landscape of traditional industries. It has also cre-\nated significant shareholder value, supporting one of the biggest and longest bull\nmarkets in history.\nUnfortunately, as ethereal bits eclipse concrete atoms, traditional financial meas-\nures become less reliable at capturing value. Our accounting system, designed to\ntrack the movement of physical capital, is inelegant in recognizing knowledge\ncapital. The investment rules developed by Graham and Dodd for post-\nDepression companies have little to say about intangible assets. But none of this\nmatters to the stock market, which clearly has rewarded brains over brawn.\nHappily, there is a common denominator for valuing atoms and bits: cash. In fact,\nGraham and Dodd were right all along: the value of a business is the present\nvalue of future free cash flows. Debates about purchase versus pooling, expens-\ning versus capitalizing, and income statement versus balance sheet all overlook a\nbasic verity: the stock market follows cash. Increasingly, intellectual capital is re-\nplacing physical capital\u2014freeing huge sums of cash and confounding traditional\nanalysis.\nThis report is broken into four parts. First, we explore the shift from atoms to bits.\nOur analysis reveals clear evidence of a surge in intellectual capital that is not\nwell captured in aggregate data. Second, we highlight the cash conversion cycle\nas a useful starting point in identifying companies that are successfully replacing\ntangible assets with intellectual capital. Third, we apply the cash conversion cycle\nto various sectors and companies. This analysis highlights shifts in the economy\nand provides critical insights about valuation. Finally, we show how the cash con-\nversion cycle can be a great tool for stock picking.\n"

Knowledge is replacing\nphysical things as both the primary input and the final output of the production\nprocess. The proof is everywhere, from radical new production processes to the\nbooming software industry.\n4\nConsider a beverage can. In 1958, Reynolds Metals developed a seven-ounce\naluminum can to compete with the standard steel can.\n5 The new container\nweighed a relatively hefty two-thirds of an ounce, and required costly chemicals\nor massive amounts of expensive electric power to produce.\nThis all changed when aluminum producers and can manufacturers figured out\nhow to make the aluminum can into a viable alternative to the steel can. Improved\nmanufacturing know-how reduced the weight of the can to less than half an\nounce. The creation of an expansive recycling network\u2014recycled aluminum uses\nabout 5% of the electricity needed to make ingot out of scratch\u2014circumvented\nthe massive power cost disadvantage. The technology took off.\nBy 1967, the year Coke and Pepsi started using the aluminum can, engineers\nhad figured out how to reduce the material used by more than 25%. Yet another\ntriumph of knowledge over nature.\nAluminum can production is a microcosm. For example, U.S. exports lost 50% of\ntheir physical weight per dollar of value from 1990 to 1996.\n6\nThe trend away from manufacturing and toward services and other nonphysical\noutput has become pronounced. In 1800, only 3% of the domestic workforce held\nservice jobs. By 1950, that number had jumped to 45%. We expect 70% of the\ndomestic workforce to hold service jobs by the turn of the millennium (see\nFigure 1).\n7\n"

Actually, we see just the opposite: overall asset efficiency appears to have\ndeteriorated, with asset turns (sales/average total assets) falling from 1.04 in\n1987 to 0.86 in 1998.\n11 The apparent conclusion is that more assets are needed\nto generate the same amount of revenue.

R.G. Associates estimates that 1,369 special charges were taken or\nannounced during 1998 (charges for restructuring, in-process R&D, merger-\nrelated items, and write-downs), representing $72.1 billion.\n13\nFigure 5\nGoodwill Grows on Balance Sheets\nS&P Industrials; in percent\n2.5%\n3.0%\n3.5%\n4.0%\n4.5%\n5.0%\n5.5%\n6.0%\n6.5%\n12/98\n12/97\n12/96\n12/95\n12/94\n12/93\n12/92\n12/91\n12/90\n12/89\nAs a % of Total Assets\nAs a % of Sales\nSource: CSFB estimates, company financials, and FactSet.\n"

      "text": "Atoms, Bits, and Cash\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nCapturing Change: The Cash Conversion Cycle\nThe cash conversion cycle is a powerful tool for assessing how well a company is\nmanaging capital. It not only highlights the drivers of working capital, but also\nsheds light on the dynamics of a supply chain. Interestingly, many industry supply\nchains are being altered by information technology. These supply chains are\nevolving from a system where goods are \u201cpushed\u201d from the vendor to the cus-\ntomer to one where goods are \u201cpulled\u201d by the consumer through a responsive\nchain. The result is reduced inventories, faster receivables collection, and ex-\ntended payment terms with suppliers.\nThe Mechanics of the Cash Conversion Cycle\nThe cash conversion cycle quantifies the time between cash payment to suppliers\nand cash receipt from customers.\nThe three components of the cash conversion cycle are:\n19\n\u2022 \nDays sales outstanding (DSO).\n20 The number of days between the sale of a\nproduct and the receipt of a cash payment.\n\u2022 \nDays in inventory (DII).\n21 The speed with which the stock of raw materials,\nwork in progress and finished goods of a company are converted into product\nsales.\n\u2022 \nDays payables outstanding (DPO).\n22 The number of days between the pur-\nchase of an input from a vendor and cash payment to that vendor.\nFigure 8\nComponents of the Cash Conversion Cycle\nDays Payables Outstanding\nCash Conversion Cycle   \nPayment Received\nDays in Inventory\nSupplier Paid\nCustomer Purchase\nInventory Purchased\nDays Sales Outstanding\nSource: CSFB.\nInvestors should look for a pattern of short or shortening DSO and DII. Both in-\nventories and receivables tie up cash\u2014every dollar freed from inventories or re-\nceivables translates into a one-time contribution to cash flow and a reduced need\nfor product financing through the supply chain.\n23\nInvestors should look for a lengthening of days payables outstanding. The attrac-\ntion of an account payable is similar to that of a charge card: enjoy the merchan-\ndise now, pay later. Payables are a flexible and cheap form of financing, with\nimplicit sensitivity to product demand and order patterns.\nAlthough payables lack explicit financing charges, the financing costs associated\nwith them are passed along in the cost of goods sold. Earlier payment is usually\nrewarded with a discount that translates into higher margins. Thus, while late\npayment is better on a cash basis, investors must monitor the movement in mar-\ngins that accompanies extended terms.\nSome businesses lengthen days payables outstanding beyond the days in in-\nventory and days sales outstanding combined, resulting in a negative cash con-\nversion cycle. This strategy turns working capital into a source of cash as\nsuppliers finance sales growth.\n24 Increasingly, managements in both new and old\neconomy businesses are looking at lengthening payables as a way of boosting\nthe return on invested capital in their businesses.\n"

Many consumer businesses are cash and\ncarry, meaning that the typical 30- to 45-day terms extended in business-to-\nbusiness transactions are not required. Furthermore, an abundance of real-time\npurchase information often gives these companies the ability to carry optimal lev-\nels of inventory.\n"

While the average cash conversion cycle in the sector\ndropped a mere 12.6%, from an average of 48.3 in 1991 to 42.3 days in the\nfirst two quarters of 1999, the absolute level is still less than half of its cyclical\ncounterpart.\n\u2022 \nBasic materials. The basic materials sector usually sits at the beginning of the\nsupply chain and deals in physical goods. Consequently, it is one of only two\nsectors that actually showed a lengthening cash conversion cycle over the\n1990s.

For\nexample, Microsoft, an icon of the Information Age, had a negative 83.0-day cash\nconversion cycle and traded at 83.1 times noncash assets at its 1999 fiscal year-\nend. On the same day, Exxon, the world\u2019s largest oil company, had a negative\n0.7 day cash conversion cycle and traded at 2.1 times its noncash assets.\nFigure 11\nAsset Values and Market Values Diverge in the New Economy\nin millions; ratios in units\nExxon Corp.\nMicrosoft Corp.\nFor the quarter ended\n6/30/99\nFor the quarter ended\n6/30/99\nDays In:\nDays In:\n   Sales\n28.37\n   Sales\n35.05\n   Inventory\n15.52\n   Inventory\n0.00\n   Payables\n44.54\n   Payables\n117.58\nCCC:\n(0.65)\nCCC:\n(82.52)\nPartial Balance Sheet - excluding cash & investments\nPartial Balance Sheet - excluding cash & investments\nin millions\nin millions\nAssets\n6/30/99\nAssets\n6/30/99\nCurrent Assets\nCurrent Assets\n   Accounts receivable\n9,107\n   Accounts receivable\n2,245\n   Inventories\n4,787\n   Inventories\n0\n   Other current assets\n1,187\n   Other current assets\n752\nTotal current assets\n15,081\nTotal current assets\n2,997\n   Property and equipment\n65,002\n   Property and equipment\n1,611\n   Other assets\n9,804\n   Other assets\n940\n74,806\n2,551\nTotal Operating Assets\n89,887\n              \nTotal Operating Assets\n5,548\n                \nMarket Capitalization\nMarket Capitalization\n   Share price\n77.13\n$              \n   Share price\n90.19\n$              \n   Shares outstanding\n2,428\n   Shares outstanding\n5,109\n187,259.50\n$     \n460,767.94\n$     \nMarket Capitalization / Operating Assets\n2.08\nMarket Capitalization / Operating Assets\n83.05\nNote: annualized quarterly data.\nSource: Company financials.\nSecond, even within a traditional industry such as steel, we see serious valuation\nmismatches based on different cash conversion cycles. Steel was the quintes-\nsential manufactured product of the early Twentieth Century. Once, sheer brawn\nadded most of the value in the production of steel\u2014extracting the ore, shipping it\nto the mills, and the like. Now, the revolutionary application of intellectual capital\nto the production process makes brains more important than brawn. Bethlehem\nSteel once required three to four man-hours of labor to make a ton of steel. To-\nday, Nucor Steel can process the same ton in 45 minutes. This substitution of bits\nfor atoms is immediately apparent in the cash conversion cycle.\n 27\n"

By\nJune 30, 1999, Dell stock traded at $37.00 per share, almost sixty times the ear-\nlier value.\nOver the period, Dell management made a deliberate effort to break out all inter-\nnal activities into their operational components, isolating the essential drivers of\nreturn on invested capital. This process highlighted the importance of working\ncapital requirements on invested capital totals.\nThrough the implementation of the direct model (build to order) and fast receiv-\nables collection, the company actually turned working capital into a source of\ncash. Dell\u2019s return on invested capital went from 37% in 1995 to 195% in 1998.\nBecause so much of Dell\u2019s invested capital was tied up in working capital, we\nestimate that without the improvements in the cash conversion cycle, Dell\u2019s return\non investment would be roughly two-thirds  its current level.\nThe effective management of these assets over the period led to a dramatic rise\nin market value.\nFigure 14\nDell\u2019s Shortening CCC Translates into Market Value\nin millions; ratios in units\n(20)\n(10)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n4/99\n10/98\n4/98\n10/97\n4/97\n10/96\n4/96\n10/95\n4/95\nIn days\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nRelative Price\nCash Conversion Cycle\nRelative Price\nSource: Company financials, disclosure, and FactSet.\nConclusion\nThe economy is in transition.

First, it reduces\ndepreciation and/or amortization expense, helping operating margins. Sec-\nond, it boosts future reported earnings by recognizing future expenses in the\ncurrent period. Finally, it shrinks the asset base, enhancing returns. Restruc-\nturing charges have become more and more prevalent. Warren Buffett re-\ncently said, \u201cI believe that the behavior of managements has been...worse\nwhen it comes to restructurings and merger accounting...many CEOs think\nthis kind of manipulation is not only okay, but actually their duty.\u201d \n30\n\u2022 \nAs the source of value has shifted, employees have become more and more\nvaluable. Increasingly, the way to attract and motivate employees is through\nemployee stock options (giving them \u201ca piece of the action\u201d) \n31. Although cash\ncompensation is expensed, most employee stock options are not. Recogniz-\ning employee stock options as an expense serves to reduce operating profits\nand depress computed returns.\nCurrent accounting convention views research, development, software, and in-\nformation technology spending as costs\u2014which are expensed on the income\nstatement\u2014rather than as investments in future growth\u2014which are capitalized on\nthe balance sheet. This convention has caused a material understatement both of\nthe reported asset base and earnings. The impact is significant. To put it in per-\nspective, consider that U.S. companies spent $212 billion on information technol-\nogy in 1996 alone.\n32\n"

In addi-\ntion, the companies listed below were excluded for one or more of the following\nreasons: (1) accounts payable is not reported as a separate line; item, (2) quar-\nterly data is missing; or (3) financing is a core business.\nFigure 15\nCompanies Excluded in Calculation of the S&P 500 Cash Conversion Cycle\nS&P 500 sector definitions\nSector\nTicker\nCompany Name\nSector\nTicker Company Name\nBasic Materials\nTIN\nTEMPLE-INLAND INC\nEnergy\nRD\nROYAL DUTCH PET  -NY REG\nCapital Goods\nGE\nGENERAL ELECTRIC CO\nFinancial\nAll\nMDR\nMCDERMOTT INTL INC\nCommunication Services\nNXTL\nNEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS\nHealth Care\nAET\nAETNA INC\nPCS\nSPRINT PCS GROUP\nHUM\nHUMANA INC\nT\nAT&T CORP\nPNU\nPHARMACIA & UPJOHN INC\nUNH\nUNITED HEALTHCARE CORP\nConsumer Cyclicals\nCD\nCENDANT CORP\nWLP\nWELLPOINT HLTH NETWRK  -CL A\nDNB\nDUN & BRADSTREET CORP\nHLT\nHILTON HOTELS CORP\nTechnology\nCA\nCOMPUTER ASSOCIATES INTL INC\nRX\nIMS HEALTH INC\nEGG\nPERKINELMER INC\nFDC\nFIRST DATA CORP.\nConsumer Staples\nKO\nCOCA-COLA CO\nPEP\nPEPSICO INC\nTransportation\nAll\nPG\nPROCTER & GAMBLE CO\nUMG\nMEDIAONE GROUP INC\nUtilities\nAll\nUN\nUNILEVER N V  -NY SHARES\nVO\nSEAGRAM CO LTD\nBecause the aggregated calculations are sales weighted, large companies may\nhave undue influence on the entire sector\u2019s cash conversion cycle.

In a purchase of net assets, this is exactly what happens: the net assets purchased from the\nselling entity are recorded on the acquirer\u2019s books at fair value. Any premium over and above fair value is goodwill. While part of the\ngap between book value and price is allocated to the target\u2019s identifiable net assets to bring them up to fair value, the largest portion (up\nto 90% in some acquisitions) is assigned to goodwill.\nPooling accounting merges two firms using the existing recorded book values of their net assets. There is no adjustment to fair value\nbecause the underlying assumption is that there has not been an exchange of economic resources, but rather a combining of equity\ninterests.\n16 See \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal\u201d by Michael Mauboussin and Bob Hiler, Credit Suisse First Boston, April 27, 1998.\n17 Assumes net working capital and net PPE remained at the same percentage of sales as in 1990 in each subsequent year.
