The system led him up a steep and narrow footpath, \u201cinsisting the path was a road.\u201d The \ncar finally came to a stop at a fence, inches from a cliff with a 100-foot drop. Jones was whisked to safety, \nbut the lesson is clear: slavishly submitting to false signals can lead you astray.2  \n \nThe worlds of business, investing, and sports are awash in numbers. We all know that the numbers are not \nequally informative, yet we rarely pause to consider what makes for a suitable statistic. Here, we provide a \nway to think about the numbers you use and put them in a format that allows you to compare across \ndomains.3 \n \nPersistent and Predictive  \n \nThe first quality to seek in a statistic is persistence, which means what happens in the present is similar to \nwhat happened in the past. For activities that are largely a matter of skill, persistence tends to be high. For \nactivities that have a lot of luck, persistence is low. Statisticians use the word \u201creliable\u201d to capture this idea.  \n \nTrue score theory is one of the best ways to think about persistence.4 It says: \n \nObserved score = true ability (skill) + random error (luck) \n \nWhen the ratio of true ability to observed score is high, we know the statistic will be persistent. We can \nmeasure persistence using the correlation coefficient, a measure of the degree of linear relationship between \ntwo variables in a pair of distributions. \n \nThe correlation coefficient, r, takes a value that ranges from 1.00 to -1.00. When r is 1.00, a plot of each \npoint from both distributions falls on a straight line. Values from each distribution need not be the same, but \nthe differences are identical. If r = -1.00, there is a perfect inverse correlation: an increase in one variable \nleads to a decrease in the other. When r = 0, results are random.   \n \nThe SAT, a standardized test for admission into U.S. colleges, provides a good example.5 About half of the \nstudents who sit for the SAT take it more than once.6 The correlation between the score on the first and \nsecond test is about 0.90.7 SAT scores are very persistent, which means the exam accurately captures the \nskills it tests for.    \n \nThe second quality you want in a statistic is predictive value, or that it is highly correlated with the outcome you \nare trying to achieve. Statisticians say a statistic is \u201cvalid\u201d if it effectively measures what it is supposed to \nmeasure. For the SAT, for instance, you might want to predict cumulative college grade point average (GPA), \ngraduation rate, or income after college. The correlations between SAT scores and these factors, roughly in a \nrange of 0.20 to 0.50, are not as high as those for persistence but are positive.8  \n \nNote that while the concepts of persistence and predictive value may be related, they are really distinct ideas. \nYou can have a metric that is extremely persistent but tells you very little about what you are trying to achieve. \nImagine shooting arrows that consistently land in the same spot far from a bullseye. Alternatively, you can \nhave a statistic that is predictive but not persistent. Here, the arrows are scattered all over the target but the \naverage of all the arrows is a bullseye. The group is accurate but no individual shot is reliable.   \n"

      "text": "April 5, 2016  \nWhat Makes for a Useful Statistic \n3 \nThe goal is to find a statistic that offers a robust combination of persistence and predictive value. One way to \nvisualize this is to plot the statistics on a simple chart (see Exhibit 1). The horizontal axis uses the correlation \ncoefficient to measure persistence, with zero on the left and one (or negative one) on the right. Referring to \nthe equation for true score theory, results on the left reflect mostly random error, or luck, and those on the \nright capture true ability, or skill.    \n \nExhibit 1: The Persistent-Predictive Chart  \n \nSource: Credit Suisse. \n \nThe vertical axis measures predictive value, also using correlation. Statistics on the bottom of the axis have a \nlow correlation with the objective, while those on the top correlate closely with the goal. The dream statistic is \nin the upper right corner, and those in the bottom left corner are of little utility. \n \nTo illustrate how this works, we can look at SAT results and cumulative college GPA. We noted that when a \nstudent takes the SAT twice, the persistence in the scores is 0.90, which is close to the right side of the chart. \nOne study found that the correlation between SAT score and cumulative college GPA is 0.36, so a little more \nthan a third of the way up from the bottom on the vertical axis.9 If the quadrant in the bottom right corner \ncontained a circular clock face, the point would fall close to two o\u2019clock.  \n \nA sensible way to search for a useful statistic is to start with your goal and go backward. You can then \nobserve which statistics are most persistent and predictive of that outcome. You may be waiting for the \nstandard warning about correlation and causation, and here it is: you should consider causation carefully when \nassessing the predictive value. In many instances of practical utility, correlation and causality go together.   \n \nWe will examine examples from three fields: business, investing, and sports. In business, for instance, the \nobjective might be to deliver an attractive total shareholder return. Investors seek to anticipate returns, \nadjusted for risk, that are in excess of an appropriate benchmark. And in baseball the goal on offense is to \nscore runs.  \n \n \n\u2022 Little skill\n\u2022 Weak relationship \nwith goal\n\u2022 Lots of skill\n\u2022 Weak relationship \nwith goal\n\u2022 Lots of skill\n\u2022 Strong relationship \nwith goal\n\u2022 Little skill\n\u2022 Strong relationship \nwith goal\nPredictive\nPersistent\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\n"

Nearly 60 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 give guidance for earnings growth and \nnearly 40 percent do so for revenue growth.12 Earnings and sales are also the most visible estimates that \nanalysts produce, and the price/earnings multiple is the most popular measure of valuation.13  \n \nLet\u2019s start by examining the persistence and predictive value of sales growth. Exhibit 2 shows the correlation \nof one-, three-, and five-year sales growth rates for the top 1,000 companies in the world by market \ncapitalization from 1950-2014.

The persistence of fund size is 0.93 (middle \npanel of Exhibit 11), which suggests the impact that performance and flows have on size is relatively modest. \nThe correlation between fund size and alpha is -0.04 (middle panel of Exhibit 12), which says that the largest \nfunds deliver below-average alpha as a group. This finding, too, is revealed in the academic literature.23  \n \nTwo finance professors, Jonathan Berk and Richard Green, developed a model to explain this result.24 They \nsuggest a world where there are skillful investment managers and both the managers and investors recognize \nthis skill. The manager\u2019s ability to deliver excess returns is limited by assets under management such that \neach incremental dollar an investor adds reduces the expected return of the portfolio. \n \nIn such a world, a skillful manager attains assets through inflows until the expected return of the portfolio falls \nto a level roughly equal to that of the market. Berk and Green suggest that equilibrium is realized when all \nmanagers, irrespective of their level of skill, have identical expected returns. The model doesn\u2019t explain the \nmodest negative slope of the correlation, but makes clear that the capacity of a manager to deliver value tends \nto be constrained by the size of the assets under management.  \n \nInvestors commonly conflate recent results with skill. As a result, they have a tendency to invest in funds that \nhave done well and to withdraw money from funds that have done poorly. This is true for institutional investors \nas well as individuals.25 These flows benefit the fund\u2019s results when they are positive and detract from \nperformance when they are negative. One study suggests that one-third of the alpha in the hedge fund \nindustry is the result of fund flows.26  \n \nThere has been a great deal of hand wringing over the topic of short-termism, a tendency to make decisions \nthat appear beneficial in the short term at the expense of decisions that have a higher payoff in the long \nterm.27 A rise in portfolio turnover for mutual funds is a purported manifestation of this short-termism.28  \n \nThe portfolio turnover rate, which typically reflects results for one year, is the lesser of the total amount of new \nsecurities that the fund buys or sells, divided by the average monthly total assets of the fund. For instance, an \nequity mutual fund that bought $50 million of new stocks with average assets of $100 million had a portfolio \nturnover rate of 50 percent. You impute the holding period by dividing one by the rate. For instance, a 50 \npercent turnover rate equals a two-year holding period (1/.50 = 2). \n \n \n \nr = -0.04\nr = -0.08\nr = -0.07\nAlpha 3 Years\nFund Size\nNet Expense Ratio\nAlpha 3 Years\nAlpha 3 Years\nAnnual Turnover Rate\n"

      "text": "April 5, 2016  \nWhat Makes for a Useful Statistic \n11 \nTurnover is higher today than it was in the 1960s, implying shorter holding periods. While higher turnover may \nsimply reflect better information, the rise of institutional investors, lower taxes, and sharply lower transaction \ncosts, there remains a distinct sense that investors today have a shorter time horizon than in the past.29 One \nsurvey suggested a holding period of 2.8 years or more qualified as a long-term investment.30     \n \nPortfolio turnover is persistent, with a correlation of 0.78, since it is largely within the manager\u2019s control (right \npanel of Exhibit 11). Investment processes vary in their optimal trading activity. Strategies that result in active \ntrading generally incur higher costs, and are less tax efficient, than strategies that trade less frequently. \nTurnover is not very predictive, with a correlation of -0.07. So while trading costs may make a difference, the \noverall impact is modest.31    \n \nQuantitatively assessing the differential skill of money managers is a challenge because it is hard to beat the \nmarket. Indeed, the correlations near zero in Exhibit 12 indicate that results include a great deal of luck. This \nreflects the \u201cparadox of skill\u201d: when absolute skill is high and relative skill is narrow in competitive realms, luck \nplays a big role in outcomes.  \n \nBut the data suggest we can improve the probability of success by focusing on fair fees, smaller funds, and \nhigh active share. Active share is a measure of how different a portfolio is from its benchmark.32 Further, \ninvestors should seek congruence between an investment firm\u2019s perceived source of edge and the process to \nfind edge. It is less important to ask how frequently a portfolio manager trades and more important to \ndetermine whether the manager\u2019s process serves the goal.  \n \n \nStatistics for Assessing Sports  \n \nWe relegate the discussion of persistence and predictive value for offense in baseball to the appendix, but we \ninclude the results in exhibit 4.

      "text": "April 5, 2016  \nWhat Makes for a Useful Statistic \n13 \nAppendix: Baseball Statistics \n \nThe use of statistics has become more widespread in all sports but is particularly popular in baseball. Batting \naverage is the traditional statistic that general managers and fans use to assess offensive players, and earned \nrun average is popular for pitchers. In recent decades, the sabermetrics community and front offices of teams \nhave developed more useful statistics to assess players.34 We focus on hitting statistics.  \n \nExhibit 14 shows the common outcomes that occur when a player goes up to home plate. Note that an \u201cat-bat\u201d \nis different than a \u201cplate appearance.\u201d A batter records a plate appearance no matter what happens but only \nrecords an at-bat if he strikes out or puts the ball in play (leaving aside rare events).  \n \nExhibit 14: Breakdown of Common Outcomes in Baseball Hitting \n \nSource: Based on Jim Albert, \u201cA Batting Average: Does It Represent Ability or Luck?\u201d Working Paper, April 17, 2004. \n \nBatting average equals hits (singles, doubles, triples, or home runs) divided by at-bats. Strikeout rate is the \nnumber of times a batter strikes out divided by the number of plate appearances. On-base percentage plus \nslugging percentage (OPS) has become more popular, especially since it was featured in Michael Lewis\u2019s \nbook, Moneyball.35 On-base percentage roughly equals the number of hits a batter gets plus the number of \ntimes he walks divided by the number of plate appearances. Slugging percentage equals total bases divided by \nat-bats, with a single worth one base, a double worth two bases, and so on.  \n \nExhibit 15 shows scatter plots for these three statistics using data from Major League Baseball in the 2000 \nthrough 2015 seasons. We include all players with 100 or more at-bats, an average sample of 338 players \nper season. \n \nBoth batting average (r = 0.40) and OPS (r = 0.53) have a respectable correlation from year to year. Strikeout rate, \nthe plot on the far right, has a high correlation from year to year (r = 0.81) and thus is a solid indicator of skill.  \n \nThe difference in correlations is not surprising. There are more variables in determining whether a batted ball \nbecomes a hit than there are in determining whether a batter will strike out. For example, a batted ball can \nresult in either a hit or an out depending on how well the ball was hit, where it was hit, the skill of the defense, \nthe field, and the weather. On the other hand, the strikeout rate largely reflects a one-on-one battle between \nthe pitcher and batter. The only other meaningful variable is the judgment of the umpire. \nPlate \nappearance \nBase on balls\nHit by pitch\nAt-bat\nStrikeout\nIn play\nOut\nSingle\nDouble\nTriple\nHome run\n"

It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary quantitative \nalgorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all the companies included \nin its database. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default variables and incorporated into the \nalgorithms available in the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and earnings data provided by outside data vendors are \nsubject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying economics of firm performance. These adjustments provide \nconsistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies across industries or national borders. The default scenario that is \nproduced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline valuation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce \nalternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request.  \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation \nmodel establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default variables may also \nbe adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur. Additional information about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on \nrequest.  \n\u00a9 2016 CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved \n \n \n"
