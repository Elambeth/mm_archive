Nearly all \ninvestment opportunities present a range of possible outcomes \nwith some chance of occurring. The goal is to invest in situations \nwhere the expected value, the sum of the potential outcomes \ntimes the probability that they happen, is different than the price.  \nComing up with thoughtful probabilities can be hard. Academics \nwho study the intelligence community find it useful to distinguish \nbetween probability and confidence.1 Probability is an \u201cestimate of \nthe chances that a statement is true\u201d and confidence is \u201cthe \ndegree to which an analyst believes that he or she possesses a \nsound basis for assessing uncertainty.\u201d2 The important point is \nthat these are distinct concepts that often get combined. We \nbelieve that it is useful for investors to separate them. \nOne way to recognize the distinction between probability and \nconfidence is to consider how judges instruct juries to come up \nwith guilty verdicts in U.S. criminal cases. The prosecutors must \nprove that the defendant is guilty \u201cbeyond all reasonable doubt,\u201d \nwhich means there are no other reasonable explanations for the \nevidence. A jury must return a verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d if their \nconfidence in the evidence is low, even if they think the probability \nthe defendant is guilty is high.  \nThis report discusses a framework for evaluating analytic \nconfidence developed by Jeffrey Friedman, a professor of \ngovernment, and Richard Zeckhauser, a professor of political \neconomy. Investors should find this valuable for a couple reasons. \nFirst, it is useful to have an operating model for measuring \nconfidence so that it is possible to distinguish between cases \nwhere the probabilities are the same and confidence levels differ.  \nSecond, confidence can play an important role in the investment \nprocess. For example, the price of two investment opportunities \nmay present the same discount to expected value, but confidence \nin the probabilities for one may exceed those of the other. That \nnuance may be relevant for determining the appropriate weighting \nof securities within a portfolio or evaluating diversification.3 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Daniel \nKahneman, a professor emeritus of psychology and the winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic \nSciences, suggests that confidence is a feeling based on how clearly and easily a person processes the \ninformation they have. For example, members on one side of the political spectrum are more confident in their \njudgments than those on the other side.4 Kahneman notes that \u201cdeclarations of high confidence mainly tell you \nthat an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.\u201d5    \nAnother sense relates to the accuracy of judgments. For example, a person is overconfident if his or her \nsubjective probabilities exceed the objective outcomes. While decision makers can be underconfident, there is \nsubstantial evidence that forecasters, even those deemed to be experts, are overconfident.6 This is especially \ntrue when participants are certain that their answers are correct.7      \nFinally, confidence is sometimes described in statistical terms, reflecting the data used to come to a conclusion. \nFor example, statisticians use a \u201cconfidence interval\u201d to provide a range of estimates for a parameter with an \nunknown value. As an illustration, if you take a sample of 36 men in the U.S. and find their average height is 70 \ninches, and you know the standard deviation of height is 3 inches, you can say with 95 percent confidence that \nthe average height of all men is between 69 and 71 inches.8 Confidence in this sense is most relevant for normal, \nor bell-shaped, distributions. \nIn many cases, confidence is a sense that has roots more in psychology than in statistics. Consider that the \nevidence shows that job interviews, as commonly done, are largely ineffective. Even so, interviewers are often \nconfident they have selected the right candidate for the job.9 This is consistent with what Kahneman and the late \nAmos Tversky, a professor of psychology, called the \u201cillusion of validity.\u201d A good perceived fit between the \npredicted outcome and the input generates unjustified confidence.10 \nIn reality, analysts often fail to use statements of probability at all and resort to words or phrases that can be \ninterpreted with a wide range of outcomes. For example, what does it mean if an economist suggests that a \nrecession in the next 12 months is a \u201creal possibility?\u201d11 Based on a survey of a large number of participants, \ninterpretations of this phrase fall between 25 and 85 percent, a range that is neither informative nor helpful. \nForecasts should include probabilities rather than words for the sake of clarity and as the basis to provide \nfeedback.    \nBefore we discuss methods to assess analytic confidence, we need to spend a few moments on the ways to \ncome up with probabilities and how they apply to this discussion.  \nThe Forms of Probability \nThere are three main approaches to setting probabilities.12 The first is frequency, which is based on inference \nfrom a sample of an appropriate reference class. For example, if you rolled a die 1,000 times, you could say that \nthe probability of landing on a 3 is 16.7 percent (1 in 6) based on the outcomes that you observe. Casinos rely \non the frequency approach because they control the payoffs for various activities. While there is normal variance \nin the short run, the outcomes converge to the probabilities in the long run. For frequentists, probability is the \nlong-term frequency of events occurring. \nSecond is the propensity approach, which is based on how a physical system generates outcomes. In this case, \nwhen a perfect cube is rolled that has the numbers 1 through 6 marked on each side, it will have the propensity \n"

Engineers commonly use this method when they assess \nthe likelihood of physical systems failing.13  \nThe third is subjective, which says that probabilities are assessed based on the personal belief of the observer. \nOne way to pinpoint this probability is to measure an analyst\u2019s willingness to bet.14 In this case, an analyst who \nis neutral to risk would be indifferent between doing nothing and betting $1 on rolling a 3 if the payoff was $6 ($1 \n= .167 \u00d7 $6). Investment analysts deal mostly with subjective probabilities. \nAn analyst should revise his or her subjective probability, a measure of a degree of belief, as new information \nbecomes available. The formal way to do this is with Bayes\u2019 Theorem, which updates a prior probability with a \nnew probability conditioned on novel information.15 The frequentists and Bayesians have had intellectual feuds \nover which approach is superior, but most aspects of investing require a Bayesian approach.16 \nThat investors operate primarily with subjective probabilities does not mean that they cannot be set carefully or \nthat the degree of confidence will not vary. We now turn to the heart of our discussion: how to judge confidence \nin a probabilistic assessment. \nAssessing Analytic Confidence \nFriedman and Zeckhauser describe three dimensions to analytic confidence: reliability of available evidence, \nrange of reasonable opinion, and responsiveness to new information. They also ran experiments to affirm that \neach dimension contributed to how individuals made decisions. Experiment participants included members of \nthe intelligence community as well as respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We examine each source of \nconfidence. \nReliability of available evidence. This dimension says an analyst has a sound basis for assessing uncertainty \nwhen they have a solid amount of relevant knowledge related to the case. It answers the question, \u201cCan I defend \nthis estimate with a substantial amount of information?\u201d17 This dimension is based on facts rather than \nspeculation or opinion. Facts and opinion are both important in investing, but facts should always carry more \nweight in assessing confidence. \nThis dimension considers how much information is available, the importance of particular data points, how \nknowledgeable the analyst is about the topic, and whether independent sources converge on similar \nassessments. \nInformation that is highly reliable can generate a wide variety of probabilities. For instance, when drawing one \ncard from a complete deck of 52 cards, you can say with high confidence that the odds are 50 percent that the \ncard is a particular color, 25 percent it is a specific suit, and 23 percent it is a court card. \nLikewise, the same probability can reflect a range of reliable information. A judgment that a candidate has a 50 \npercent chance of winning may reflect either high confidence in a tight race or no information and therefore no \nbasis to favor one candidate over another. \nPsychologists distinguish between two ways of coming up with a prior probability.18 The first is to examine base \nrates. This considers the current situation as an instance of a larger reference class. That allows the analyst to \nexamine the distribution of past outcomes and to calibrate the probabilities and outcomes for the case in \nquestion.   \n"

All rights reserved. \n6506960 Exp. 3/31/2025 \n4\n \nThe second approach, called the \u201cinside view,\u201d combines the particular conditions with personal inputs. This is \na natural way to think but can overweight our experience in a way that distorts our perception. Thoughtful \nforecasts are a blend of base rates and the inside view, but we tend to overweight the inside view. Participants \nin studies make better forecasts when they are exposed to, and consider, base rates.19  \nThe major challenge in applying base rates is finding an appropriate reference class. An analyst can be justifiably \nmore confident when a problem is clearly part of a reference class that is well defined. There can also be a \ntrade-off between specificity and sample size. You want the base rate to be specific enough to capture what you \nare trying to estimate while at the same time having a sample size that is sufficient to draw a reasonable \ninference.  \nSales growth forecasting is a good illustration of where base rates can be useful for investors. This is relevant \nbecause sales growth is the most important driver of value for most businesses.20 Analysts commonly rely on \nthe inside view when modeling sales growth even though research demonstrates that using base rates can \nimprove the quality of sales growth forecasts.21  \nConfidence in the reliability of available evidence is a mix of its strength and weight. Strength reflects the \nextremeness of outcomes, and weight is the predictive validity based on sample size. If you want to assess your \nconfidence that a coin is biased to land on tails, the percentage of times the coin landed on tails captures the \nstrength and the sample size sets the weight. \nOur degree of belief in a particular hypothesis typically integrates strength and weight, and there are prescribed \nways to combine them properly. But forecasters tend to overemphasize the strength of evidence at the expense \nof its justified weight. This leads to a predictable pattern. Analysts are overconfident when the strength is high \nand weight is low (high percentage of tails in a small sample of flips) and underconfident when the strength is \nlow and the weight is high (over 50 percent tails with a very large number of flips).22 \nConfidence from reliability grows when the forecast is informed by a large sample of outcomes from an \nappropriate reference class. Confidence can also be the result of dispositive information, although that is rare in \nthe investment industry.  \nRange of reasonable opinion. When you are dealing with a complex system, the inputs may not lead to outputs \nin a simple fashion. That means that if people tamper with the system, even if their intentions are good, they do \nnot know what outcomes their actions may produce. This dimension answers the question, \u201cMight reasonable \npeople give substantially different answers to this question?\u201d \nClimate change is a classic example. There is reliable evidence for a large and sustained increase in carbon \ndioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. The Earth\u2019s CO2 levels are in a range last seen millions of years ago.23 The \nchallenge is that it is hard to determine the impact of this rise, and scientists, who are equally serious and \nqualified, can come to different conclusions about the implications.24  \nPsychologists call the probability assigned to an outcome \u201cfirst order uncertainty.\u201d The reasonable range of \nprobabilities for first order uncertainty is called \u201csecond order uncertainty.\u201d It describes how uncertain you are \nabout an uncertain outcome.  \nIn February 2023, media reports said that the U.S. Energy Department had concluded that the Covid pandemic \n\u201cmost likely\u201d arose from a laboratory leak but made its judgment with \u201clow confidence.\u201d25 One way to think about \n"

Bernanke was at the time the chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve. The letter expressed concern that asset purchases associated with quantitative easing \n\u201crisk currency debasement and inflation.\u201d26 The dollar index forged higher and inflation remained muted in the \nfollowing years. In 2014, all the authors stood by their initial message.27 A charitable but sensible interpretation \nis that reasonable people could disagree on the consequences of quantitative easing and that the concerns this \ngroup expressed simply did not come to pass. \nAn important takeaway is that confidence has to be, to some degree, related to the nature of the system. At one \nend of the spectrum are systems that are simple to understand, such as dice and cards, which is why we use \nthem to explain probabilities. There is no second order uncertainty with these systems. At the other end are \nsystems that are complex and non-linear, where the distributions of the outcomes are \u201cwild\u201d and making \nforecasts is inherently challenging.28 Economies and ecosystems are examples.29 Second order uncertainties \nare high. \nInvestors deal with systems near both ends of the spectrum and their confidence should vary accordingly.30 This \nis especially relevant when trying to integrate macroeconomic factors with the drivers of corporate value. \nResponsiveness to new information. The idea is that analysts should be more confident when they expect \nthat additional analysis will have little impact on their beliefs. This answers the question, \u201cIs my view likely to \nchange substantially if I study the subject further?\u201d \nThe response reflects how strongly an analyst holds a prior view and the availability of useful information given \nthe necessary time and money to access it. This introduces the constraints of time and resources. \nResponsiveness to new information compels the decision maker to think about the cost and benefit of pursuing \nadditional information. This sets a decision threshold. For an investor, the issue is whether the pursuit of new \ninformation is likely to change the overall investment thesis. An investment thesis is based on a variant \nperception, the difference between what the investor believes will happen and what is priced into the stock. \nThe idea is that there is almost always the opportunity to gather new information at a cost. Early on, new \ninformation may change the thesis so the benefit of pursuing it is worth the cost. But at some point, additional \ninformation is unlikely to change the thesis so seeking it is not worth the time and money. The added evidence \nmay not be noise, but its payoff is poor.  \nExperiments have shown a noteworthy link between accessing additional information and confidence.31 \nResearchers measured the accuracy and confidence of participants making bets on college football games. \nAccuracy is the proportion of correct predictions, and confidence is the subjective probability of being correct. A \nparticipant is well calibrated when his or her subjective probabilities match the outcomes. When subjective \nprobabilities are higher than the outcomes, the participant is overconfident. When subjective probabilities are \nlower than the outcomes, the participant is underconfident. \nAs participants gained access to more information about the teams playing, their accuracy remained flat, but \ntheir confidence increased. This means that the gap between subjective probability and the results widened. \nAdditional data made the participants overconfident rather than smarter. \n"

All rights reserved. \n6506960 Exp. 3/31/2025 \n6\n \nThis can be relevant for investors because gathering additional information can delay a decision, create a cost, \nor foster a false sense of confidence. The relationship between the amount of information and confidence is \ntricky and investors should be very mindful of the trade-offs involved. \nThese results have a fascinating twist. The researchers developed a statistical model that became more \naccurate when fed the extra cues. The model was better than the humans at incorporating new information. The \nconfidence of the participants tracked the statistical model, even though their accuracy did not improve. It is as \nif the participants knew that more information should lead to more accurate forecasts, but they did not have the \nskill to integrate the additional data. \nConclusion \nSuccess in active investing requires finding gaps between expected value and price. Expected value, in turn, \nconsolidates outcomes and their associated probabilities. This report draws attention to the distinction between \nprobabilities and confidence in those probabilities. Further, we argue that assessing confidence is helpful in the \ninvestment process. \nInvestors generally rely on subjective probabilities, or how strongly they believe various proposals. These \nprobabilities should be updated as new information is revealed. Bayes\u2019 Theorem provides a proper way to update \nprobabilities, but the key is to revise figures in the right direction and magnitude. Great forecasters refine their \nforecasts with greater frequency and granularity than do average forecasters.32  \nScholars who study analytic confidence describe three relevant dimensions: reliability of available evidence, \nrange of reasonable opinion, and responsiveness to new information. Reliability says that information exists to \ncome to a sound conclusion. Range of reasonable opinion acknowledges that the outcomes in complex systems \ncan be wide and difficult to forecast. Responsiveness to new information weighs how likely it is that a thesis will \nchange following the introduction of additional data.  \nInvestors can use these dimensions to complement their probability assessments and sharpen their ranking of \ninvestment opportunities. Confidence may also be valuable in assessing the potential weighting of investments \nwithin a portfolio. \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 9-11 \n \n     \n \n"
