In university and hospital \nlaboratories around the world, researchers are using the latest breakthroughs in \ntechnology to trace the exact circuitry your brain uses to make the kinds of decisions \nyou rely on as an investor. \nJason Zweig\nAre You Wired for Wealth? 1\nWhile conscious control over emotions is weak, emotions can flood consciousness. \nThis is so because the wiring of the brain at this point in our evolutionary history is \nsuch that connections from the emotional systems to the cognitive systems are \nstronger than connections from the cognitive systems to the emotional systems. \nJoseph LeDoux\nThe Emotional Brain 2\nOur modern skulls house a Stone Age mind. \nLeda Cosmides and John Tooby\nEvolutionary Psychology: A Primer 3\nThe Train and the Brain \nConsider the following problem: You observe a runaway train that will kill five people if \nit continues on its current course. You can save the five people, though, by hitting a \nswitch that will divert the train to a side track where it will kill one person.  Do you hit \nthe switch, sparing the five people but at the expense of one? \nNow ponder a related problem: You have the same runaway train threatening the five \npeople. But now, you are on a bridge over the tracks next to a large stranger. Push \nthe stranger onto the tracks, and the five people are saved but the stranger dies. \nWould you push?  \nIf you are like most people, you answered yes to the first question and no to the \nsecond. Objectively, of course, the trade-off is the same: five lives versus one life. \nWhy are we willing to trade one for five in the first instance, but not in the second? \nPrinceton researchers found that the first scenario\u2014the \u201cimpersonal dilemma\u201d\u2014\nactivated brain areas related to memory. In contrast, the second, more personal \nscenario triggered areas associated with emotion. Even those who answer yes in the \nsecond dilemma take twice as long to answer the question. The emotional brain is \nscreaming \u201cno,\u201d and it takes some effort to override that response. 4 \nWhile there are lots of unresolved questions in the investing world, perhaps none is as \nfascinating and relevant as the workings of human cognition. Scientists have \nestablished that distinct parts of our brains handle various problems, and that we \nMichael J.

The evidence also shows that \nwe all have diverse neurobiological make-ups because of hereditary and environmental differences. \nWe all know people that are more emotional, or rational, than average and these cognitive differences \nundoubtedly shape investing temperaments and skills. 5 \nAlso critical is that our brains evolved in an environment that was very different from the one in which \nwe find ourselves today. So some of the contemporary stimuli that trigger reactions and emotions are \nmuch different than what triggered actions in the past. While a short-term financial loss may have the \nsame effect on you as seeing a snake, you don\u2019t want to deal with the two situations the same way.     \nAs we learn more about our brains, we may be able to alter our investment behavior individually so as \nto improve our results. As neuroscientist Antonio Damasio says, \u201cYou will be much more in control if \nyou realize how much you are not in control.\u201d 6  \nThe Train and the Brain: Part II (The Story of Phineas Gage) \nIn 1848, a 25-year-old railway worker named Phineas Gage was in charge of blasting rock to clear the \nway for track expansion. The workers drilled a hole, filled it with explosive powder, added a fuse, and \ntopped the powder with sand. Part of Gage\u2019s job was to tamp the sand with an iron rod to make sure \nthat the powder properly detonated. \nOne fateful afternoon, Gage filled a hole with powder and was waiting for a co-worker to add the sand. \nJust then someone behind him called, and Gage looked over his right shoulder. Thus distracted, Gage \nstarted to tamp before his co-worker had added the sand. He sparked a fire, causing the rod to fire out \nof the rock toward him.  \nThe rod entered Gage\u2019s left cheek, blasted through the front of his brain, and exited the top of his skull \nat high speed. (See Exhibit 1.) The rod\u2014thirteen-and-half pounds, three-feet seven inches long, and \none and a quarter inches wide\u2014landed more than a hundred feet away. The impact threw Gage on \nhis back but within a few moments he was speaking. He then rode nearly a mile to town in an ox cart \nand managed to get up and walk to the doctor\u2019s office with little assistance. \nExhibit 1: Phineas Gage\u2019s Injury \n \nSource: http://soma.npa.uiuc.edu/courses/bio303/Ch1.html. \nAmazingly, Gage not only survived but maintained most of his faculties: he could touch, hear, see, and \nsuffered no paralysis.  What did change was Gage\u2019s personality. Known as a measured, diligent, hard-\nworking man, he became \u201cfitful, irreverent\u201d and indulged in \u201cthe grossest profanity which was not \npreviously his custom.\u201d Gage also lost an ability to plan for the future. Friends summed it up by saying, \n\u201cGage was no longer Gage.\u201d 7  \n \n"

      "text": "    Page 3 \nThe Mind of the Investor \nGage\u2019s remarkable story is a vivid illustration of the modularization of brain function. He lost a significant \npart of his right frontal cortex, a part of the brain that (among other things) keeps us from saying \neverything we think and helps us plan for the future. The part of the brain we use to solve a problem is \nlikely to influence the solution we come up with.  \nTake a recent example based on the Pepsi Challenge. In a 1970s and 1980s marketing tactic, Pepsi \nconducted consumer taste tests pitting its drink versus rival Coca-Cola. A majority of the time, people \npreferred Pepsi\u2019s taste. But Coke continues to be the top cola brand. What gives? \nNeuroscientist Read Montague recently set out to answer the question using magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) technology. Montague first restaged the Pepsi Challenge and corroborated the past \nmarketing claims by showing that Pepsi generates a stronger response in a brain region associated with \nreward. Now this is downright weird: if enjoying a soft drink is about taste, why isn\u2019t the best-tasting brand \nwinning? \nBut Montague\u2019s investigation didn\u2019t stop there. He repeated the test with a twist\u2014instead of presenting \nunidentified samples, he told the tasters which one was Coke. All of a sudden, a majority of the drinkers \npreferred Coke. And, remarkably, Montague found activity in the part of the brain linked to high-level \ncognitive powers. Coke wasn\u2019t winning on taste alone, but on a combination of taste and other \n(presumably positive) associations. 8    \nIt\u2019s not too hard to make the leap from seeing how Coke beats Pepsi to seeing why we might prefer one \ninvestment to another\u2014even when the rational facts don\u2019t justify that preference. Many investors have \npositive or negative histories with stocks, and their emotions play a real role in guiding their decisions.  \nHere are some other examples of how our brains work, and the implications for investors:  \n\u2022 \nPattern recognition. Humans are natural pattern seekers. In fact, we\u2019re so used to finding patterns \nthat we see them when they aren\u2019t really there. Examples include the \u201chot hand\u201d in basketball and \nstock charts. Pattern recognition was extremely important to the survival of our ancestors, and is hard \nwired in our brains. 9  \nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to track activity, neuroscientists found that parts \nof the prefrontal cortex specialize in pattern recognition, especially in repetition and alternation. \nAmazingly, the researchers discovered that the brain starts to anticipate another repetition after a \nstimulus occurs only twice in a row. 10   \nTake a look at Exhibit 2 and consider where you think the next two data points should appear. Now \nlook at Exhibit 3, which reveals the underlying system: Cisco\u2019s quarterly sales growth from early 1998 \nthrough early 2002. Our strong inclination is to extrapolate a trend. When a pattern breaks, parts of \nthe brain that cause fear and anxiety become active. \nExhibit 2: Pattern Recognition and Extrapolation \n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nGrowth Rate\nEstimate the next \nfew data points.\n \nSource: Company data. \n"

A quick quiz: A bat and ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How \nmuch does the ball cost? \nThe first answer that pops into people minds, if not out of their mouths, is ten cents. Of course, that \nanswer is wrong. Research shows that we make many judgments very quickly, often without \nchecking. Studies of prejudice and stereotyping show that people categorize others in milliseconds. 11 \nEvidence suggests that investors, too, often rely on intuition in their decision-making. 12 \nJournalist Jason Zweig describes an experiment where an MRI machine tracked his neural hot spots \nas he tried to maximize his earnings by selecting between two boxes (one added value, the other \ndetracted\u2014he had no idea which was which). To complicate matters, the researchers inserted a \npacifier in Zweig\u2019s mouth that periodically squirted either Kool-Aid or plain water. Again, the \nresearchers told him nothing about how, when, or why he would get the Kool-Aid versus the water. \nAfter struggling a while to improve his earnings, Zweig found his earnings swelling as he repeatedly \nhit the left bottom. The reason, he explains, is that his brain unconsciously recognized association \nbetween the Kool-Aid and the added value before he had any conscious idea of what was going on. \nZweig\u2019s experience appears to be a case for using intuition. 13 \nIntuition is wonderful, but tends to fail in systems that are nonstationary (i.e., the statistical properties \nchange) and nonlinear (cause and effect are not clear). Given that markets have elements of \nnonstationarity and nonlinearity, investors should be careful about relying too heavily on intuition. \n\u2022 \nMental models. Psychologists, philosophers, and economists have long held the view that humans \nfollow basic rules of logic. (\u201cIf a, then, b\u201d and \u201ca\u201d, you can conclude, \u201cthen b\u201d.)  \nBut research by psychologist Philip Johnson-Laird shows that people instead operate with mental \nmodels. The key idea is that \u201cthe content you\u2019re reasoning about can affect the conclusions you \ndraw.\u201d Specifically, [you] think about possibilities that are compatible with the premises [you\u2019re] \nreasoning from.\u201d  \nAs a result, \u201cpeople focus on what is true or possible from a given set of premises; they often fail to \nconsider what they believe must be false.\u201d 14 \n\u2022 \nFollow the crowd.  Research by psychiatrist Greg Berns shows that, \u201cthere is probably some reward \nor kick in conforming to a group.\u201d Berns asked subjects to compare abstract images, and provided the \nanswers of four other people. In many cases, the subjects went with the majority view.  Berns then \ncompared activity between the area that deals with integrating spatial images and the decision-\nmaking prefrontal cortex. A tilt in favor of the cortex shows how people rely on others to decide. 15 \n"

When you receive a long \nshot reward, dopamine neurons become extremely active, making you feel very good. Not surprising, \nresearch shows that handicappers consistently bet too much on long shots at the track. 16  \nThat periodic reward also keeps you coming back. Scientists show that once you associate a gain \nwith a specific cue, your brain only needs the cue to release dopamine.  Finally, once it becomes \nclear that the gain will not follow the cue, dopamine fades instantly, taking you from a high to a low \nvery quickly. 17 \nInvestor Implications \nSo what lessons can investors learn from neuroscience? The first is that you should be aware of the limits \nof intuition. Intuition can be very useful in a host of circumstances, including interpersonal dealings and \ncertain professional settings. But we can often improve on the judgments and decision courses that \nintuition suggests. In particular, we should be careful to identify all alternatives. \nNext, we must be aware of the blind spots inherent in mental models. Often, we don\u2019t recognize our own \nbiases in our decision-making. \nFinally, we must be careful about interpreting patterns. Our mind wants to see patterns, and is quick to \nfind them.  \n \n \n"
