      "text": "February 23, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nAn investor\u2019s primary task is to determine whether the expectations for future financial performance, as \nimplied by the stock price, are too optimistic or pessimistic relative to how the company is likely to perform. In \nother words, the intelligent investor seeks gaps between expectations and fundamentals.2 This approach does \nnot require forecasts of pinpoint accuracy, but rather only judgments as to whether the expectations \nembedded in the shares are too high or low.  \n \nSales growth is the most important driver of corporate value.3 For companies that earn a return on invested \ncapital in excess of the cost of capital, growth amplifies value creation. For those that earn a return below the \nopportunity cost, growth destroys value. Sales growth ripples through the income statement by determining \noperating leverage and the degree of economies of scale a company can realize.  \n \nNaturally, executives want their companies to generate healthy rates of sales growth, and more than a third of \nthe companies in the S&P 500 Index provide guidance for sales growth.4 Researchers who study forecasts \nfind two common biases: optimism and overconfidence.  \n \nOptimism about predictions that are personally important encourages perseverance in the face of adversity but \nalso offers a distorted view of likely outcomes.5 Consider that only about one-half of new businesses survive \nfive or more years. Notwithstanding that fact, a survey of thousands of entrepreneurs found that more than 8 \nof 10 of them rated their odds of success at 70 percent or higher, and fully one-third did not allow for any \nprobability of failure at all.6 The bottom line on optimism: \u201cPeople frequently believe that their preferred \noutcomes are more likely than is merited.\u201d7 \n \nOverconfidence also distorts the ability to make sound predictions. This bias reveals itself when an individual\u2019s \nconfidence in his or her subjective judgments is higher than the objective outcomes warrant. For instance, \nmore than five thousand people answered 50 true-false questions and provided a confidence level for each. \nOn average, they were 60 percent correct but were 70 percent confident in their answers. When these \nsubjects were 100 percent confident in their response, they were correct only 77 percent of the time.8 Most \npeople, including financial analysts, place too much weight on their own information.9  \n \nOverconfidence shows up in forecasts as ranges of outcomes that are too narrow.10 As a case in point, \nresearchers asked chief financial officers to predict the results for the stock market, including high and low \ngrowth rates of return within which the executives were 80 percent sure the results would land. They were \ncorrect only one-third of the time.11 \n \nExhibit 1 shows how this bias manifests in forecasts of revenue growth. The solid line is the distribution of \nsales growth rates, annualized over three years and adjusted for inflation, for the 1,000 largest companies in \nthe world by market capitalization. These base rates reflect results from 1950 to 2014. The dashed line is the \ndistribution of available analyst forecasts for the sales growth rates of the largest 1,000 companies today. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Specifically, the standard deviation of estimates is 12.2 percent versus a \nstandard deviation of 18.4 percent for the past growth rates. Forecasts are commonly too optimistic and too \nnarrow. The best explanations for the pattern of faulty forecasts include behavioral biases and distortions \nencouraged by incentives.12    \n \nKnowing that we are prone to optimism and overconfidence means we need to adopt techniques to manage \nthose biases. One useful approach is to examine the experience of many companies over time, or base rates, \nand thoughtfully integrate those base rates with our own view. This is not our typical approach. As Daniel \nKahneman, the eminent psychologist, notes bluntly, \u201cPeople who have information about an individual case \nrarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs.\u201d13     \n \nThe classic way to make a forecast is to gather information, combine it with our own view, and project an \noutcome. Left to our own devices, this is how we naturally go about forecasting. Here\u2019s an example: In \nFebruary 2015, Elon Musk, chairman, product architect, and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors, proposed \nthat the company would be able to grow its sales 50 percent compounded annually for the next decade.14 \nHow would you assess that proposition?   \n \nThe natural way would be to open a spreadsheet and start counting. How big is the global automobile market? \nWhat share of total auto sales do electric cars have? Where will the market share of electric cars go? What \nshare will Tesla have? And so forth. Combine this assessment with some knowledge of the company\u2019s current \nand future offerings and you can come up with a forecast. You can do a similar exercise for the battery \nbusiness. You would then compare the results of your analysis to Musk\u2019s aspired growth rate. \n \nUsing Kahneman\u2019s language, you have collected \u201cinformation about an individual case.\u201d But what you haven\u2019t \nconsidered is \u201cthe statistics of the class to which the case belongs.\u201d We don\u2019t use base rates as much as we \nshould for a couple of reasons. First, you trust and value the work you\u2019ve done and hence are inclined to place \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n<(25)\n(25)-(20)\n(20)-(15)\n(15)-(10)\n(10)-(5)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n25-30\n30-35\n35-40\n40-45\n>45\nFrequency (Percent)\n3-Year Sales CAGR (Percent)\nBase Rates\nCurrent Estimates\n"

You have to find a suitable reference \nclass and incorporate the information appropriately.   \n  \nThough decision scientists have known for a long time that the proper integration of base rates improves the \nquality of forecasts, the technique remains remarkably underused.15 We believe this reflects the human desire \nfor a narrative. Causality is clear in stories about the specifics, which makes those scenarios vivid. Base rates, \non the other hand, are largely antiseptic and hence less appealing to the mind.    \n \nBase Rates of Sales Growth \n \nWe analyze the distribution of sales growth rates for the top 1,000 global companies by market capitalization \nsince 1950.16 This sample represents roughly 60 percent of the global market capitalization and includes all \nsectors. The population includes companies that are now \u201cdead.\u201d The main reason public companies cease to \nexist is they merge or are acquired.17 \n \nWe calculate the compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of sales for 1, 3, 5, and 10 years for each firm. We \nadjust all of the figures to remove the effects of inflation, which translates all of the numbers to 2014 dollars. \n \nExhibit 2 shows the results for the full sample. In the panel on the left, the rows show sales growth rates and \nthe columns reflect time periods. Say you want to know what percent of the universe grew sales at a CAGR of \n15-20 percent for three years. You start with the row marked \u201c15-20\u201d and slide to the right to find the column \n\u201c3-Yr.\u201d There, you\u2019ll see that 6.8 percent of the companies achieved that rate of growth. The panel on the \nright shows the sample sizes for each growth rate and time period, allowing us to see where that percentage \ncomes from: 3,261 instances out of the total of 48,136 (3,261/48,136 = 6.8 percent).      \n \nExhibit 2: Base Rates of Sales Growth (1950-2014) \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae. \nNote: CAGR = compound annual growth rate. \n \nFull Universe\nFull Universe\nSales CAGR (%)\n1-Yr\n3-Yr\n5-Yr\n10-Yr\nSales CAGR (%)\n1-Yr\n3-Yr\n5-Yr\n10-Yr\n<(25)\n1.8%\n0.6%\n0.3%\n0.0%\n<(25)\n947\n273\n152\n14\n(25)-(20)\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.3%\n0.1%\n(25)-(20)\n524\n221\n113\n30\n(20)-(15)\n1.7%\n1.1%\n0.7%\n0.3%\n(20)-(15)\n859\n515\n307\n110\n(15)-(10)\n3.1%\n2.2%\n1.7%\n0.9%\n(15)-(10)\n1,608\n1,053\n758\n334\n(10)-(5)\n6.2%\n5.2%\n4.3%\n3.4%\n(10)-(5)\n3,174\n2,509\n1,925\n1,235\n(5)-0\n12.1%\n13.1%\n13.0%\n13.1%\n(5)-0\n6,236\n6,319\n5,842\n4,785\n0-5\n20.6%\n25.1%\n28.8%\n34.6%\n0-5\n10,597 12,079 12,897 12,668\n5-10\n18.0%\n21.4%\n24.2%\n28.2%\n5-10\n9,272 10,300 10,828 10,321\n10-15\n11.4%\n12.3%\n12.5%\n11.2%\n10-15\n5,899\n5,916\n5,607\n4,120\n15-20\n6.8%\n6.8%\n6.0%\n4.3%\n15-20\n3,520\n3,261\n2,666\n1,580\n20-25\n4.5%\n3.9%\n3.1%\n1.9%\n20-25\n2,322\n1,874\n1,393\n679\n25-30\n3.0%\n2.4%\n1.9%\n1.0%\n25-30\n1,541\n1,145\n845\n359\n30-35\n2.0%\n1.5%\n1.0%\n0.5%\n30-35\n1,031\n739\n441\n178\n35-40\n1.3%\n1.0%\n0.7%\n0.3%\n35-40\n695\n495\n301\n96\n40-45\n1.0%\n0.7%\n0.4%\n0.2%\n40-45\n523\n317\n191\n62\n>45\n5.4%\n2.3%\n1.1%\n0.3%\n>45\n2,799\n1,120\n509\n92\nMean\n15.0%\n8.0%\n6.7%\n5.5%\nTotal\n51,547 48,136 44,775 36,663\nMedian\n5.8%\n5.5%\n5.2%\n4.7%\nStDev\n287.0% 18.4%\n12.0%\n7.8%\nObservations\nBase Rates\n"

      "text": "February 23, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n5 \nExhibit 3 is the distribution for the three-year sales growth rate. This represents, in a graph, the corresponding \ncolumn in exhibit 2. The mean, or average, growth rate was 8.0 percent per year and the median growth rate \nwas 5.5 percent. The median is a better indicator of the central location of the results because the distribution \nis skewed to the right. The standard deviation, 18.4 percent, gives an indication of the width of the bell curve. \n \nExhibit 3: Three-Year CAGR of Sales (1950-2014) \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae. \nNote: CAGR = compound annual growth rate. \n \nWhile the data for the full sample are a start, you want to hone the reference class of base rates to make the \nresults more relevant and applicable. One approach is to break the universe into deciles based on a \ncompany\u2019s sales in the prior year. Within each size decile, we sort the observations of growth rates into bins in \nincrements of five percentage points (except for the tails).  \n \nThere is a modest survivorship bias because each sample includes only the firms that survived for that \nspecified period. For example, a company in our 10-year sample would have had to have survived for 10 years. \nAbout one-half of all public companies cease to exist within ten years of being listed.18 \n \nThe heart of this analysis is exhibit 4, which shows each decile, the total population, and an additional analysis \nof mega companies (those with sales in excess of $50 billion). Here\u2019s how you use the exhibit. Determine the \nbase sales level for the company that you want to model. Then go to the appropriate decile based on that size. \nYou now have the proper reference class and the distribution of growth rates over the various horizons.   \n \nLet\u2019s use Tesla as an example. Musk said he hoped to grow sales 50 percent per year for the next decade \nfrom a sales base of $6 billion (actual sales for 2015 were $4 billion). You first find the correct reference class, \nwhich is the decile that has a sales base of $4.5 - $7 billion. Next you examine the row of growth that is \nmarked \u201c>45,\u201d representing sales growth of 45 percent or more. Going to the column \u201c10-Yr,\u201d you will see \nthat no companies achieved this feat. Indeed, you have to go down to 30-35 percent growth to see any \ncompanies, and even there it is only one-fifth of 1 percent of the sample. \n \n \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n<(25)\n(25)-(20)\n(20)-(15)\n(15)-(10)\n(10)-(5)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n25-30\n30-35\n35-40\n40-45\n>45\nFrequency (Percent)\nCAGR (Percent)\n"

      "text": "February 23, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n8 \nIn total, exhibit 4 shows results for 44 reference classes (11 size ranges times 4 time horizons) that should \ncover the vast majority of possible outcomes for sales growth. The appendix contains the sample sizes for \neach of the reference classes. Bear in mind that these data are adjusted for inflation and that most forecasts \nreflect inflation expectations. We will show how to incorporate these base rates into your forecasts for sales \ngrowth in a moment. For now, it\u2019s useful to acknowledge the utility of these data as an analytical guide and a \nvaluable reality check. \n \nGetting to the proper reference class is crucial, but there are some useful observations about the whole that \nare worth noting. To begin, as firm size increases the mean and median growth rates decline, as does the \nstandard deviation of the growth rates. This point has been well established empirically.19 Exhibit 5 shows this \npattern for annualized growth rates over three years. The lesson is to temper expectations about sales growth \nas companies get larger. \n \nExhibit 5: Growth Rates and Standard Deviations Decline with Size \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae. \nNote: Growth rates are annualized over three years. \n \nExhibit 6 shows that sales growth follows gross domestic product (GDP) reasonably closely. U.S. GDP growth and the \nmedian sales growth in the same year have a correlation coefficient of 0.65. (Positive correlations fall in the range of 0 \nto 1.0, where 0 is random and 1.0 is a perfect correlation.) From 1950-2014, U.S. GDP grew at 3.2 percent per year, \nadjusted for inflation, with a standard deviation of 2.3 percent.  \n \nCorporate sales growth was higher than that of the broader economy for a few reasons. First, companies growing \nrapidly often need access to capital and hence choose to go public, likely creating a selection bias. Second, some \ncompanies, including contract manufacturers, generate growth that is not captured in the GDP figures. Finally, some \ncompanies grow outside the U.S., which shows up in sales growth but fails to be reflected in GDP.20   \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n>$50B\n>$100B\nFull\nUniverse\nSales 3-Year CAGR (Percent)\nDecile (Smallest to Largest by Sales)\nMean\nMedian\nStandard Deviation\nMega\n"

      "text": "February 23, 2016  \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n9 \nExhibit 6: Median Sales Growth Is Correlated with GDP Growth \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae and Bureau of Economic Analysis. \nNote: Sales growth is for the top 1,000 global companies by market capitalization in each year.  \n \nFinally, notwithstanding our natural tendency to anticipate growth, 23 percent of the companies in the sample had \nnegative sales growth rates for 3 years, after an adjustment for inflation, and 20 percent shrank for 5 years. Whereas \na decline in sales need not be bad if it occurs for the right reasons, few analysts or corporate leaders project shrinking \nsales unless there is a clear strategy of divestiture.21 \n \nUsing Base Rates to Model Growth \n \nWe have established that there are two ways of making a forecast. You can do bottom-up research, which is the most \nnatural method, or you can turn to a base rate. The research in decision making shows that the bottom-up approach is \nsubject to biases and that incorporating the base rate generally improves the quality of the forecast. Yet we don\u2019t want \nto lean too much on either our own analysis or the base rate. We want to combine the two intelligently.  \n \nThere is a technique to combine the two approaches, which we will apply to our sales growth data.22 Correlation is the \nkey to the method. The correlation coefficient measures the degree of linear relationship between variables in a pair of \ndistributions. The value of a correlation coefficient can fall between -1.0 (the rise in one variable perfectly correlates \nwith the fall of the other) and 1.0 (both variables move in tandem). A zero correlation indicates randomness. We will \nexamine a single variable, sales growth, measured over time, and all of the correlations are positive.  \n \nIf the correlation between two distributions is high, then what happened before gives you a really good sense of what \nwill follow. For example, the correlation for cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae*) for companies in the consumer \nstaples sector is about 0.90 from one year to the next.23 That means if you know Unilever\u2019s CFROI from last year, you \ncan forecast it this year with a great deal of accuracy. The bottom-up work is highly relevant. \n \n \n*CFROI\n\u00ae \nis a registered trademark in the United States and other countries (excluding the United Kingdom) of Credit Suisse Group AG or its \naffiliates.  \n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n-5\n0\n5\n10\nAnnual Real Sales Growth (Percent)\nAnnual Real GDP Growth (Percent)\nr = 0.65\n"

Take the annual total \nshareholder returns for the S&P 500 as a case.24 The correlation from year to year, from 1928 through 2015, is \nessentially zero. Telling you last year\u2019s return provides no help in forecasting the return for this year. Your best forecast \nis the average of the reference class.  \n \nThe basic idea is that the correlation determines how you should weight the bottom-up analysis and the base rate. For \nUnilever, a sensible forecast is nine parts last year\u2019s CFROI and one part last year\u2019s average sector CFROI, the base \nrate. For your S&P 500 forecast, you should place minimal weight on what happened last year and rely largely on the \naverage return since 1928, the base rate. \n \nStudying base rates for sales growth is logical for two reasons. First, sales growth is the most important driver of value \nfor most companies. Second, sales growth has a higher correlation from year to year than does earnings growth, \nwhich is the most commonly discussed item on the income statement.25 Sales growth is important and more \npredictable than profit growth.  \n \nExhibit 7 shows that the correlation coefficient is 0.30 for the year-to-year sales growth rate.26 This includes the top \n1,000 global companies by market capitalization from 1950 to 2014. Roughly 50,000 company years are in the data, \nand all of the figures are adjusted for inflation. \n \nExhibit 7: Correlation of One-Year Sales Growth Rates \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae and Credit Suisse. \nNote: Data winsorized at 2nd and 98th percentiles. \n \nNot surprisingly, the correlations are lower for longer time periods. Exhibit 8 shows the correlations for one-, three-, \nand five-year horizons for the full population of companies. The base rate for the reference classes, the median growth \nrate, should receive the majority of the weight for forecasts of three years or longer. In fact, you might start with the \nbase rate and seek reasons to move away from it. \n \n \n \n-30\n-15\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\n75\n-30\n-15\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\n75\n90\nSales Growth Next Year (Percent)\nSales Growth (Percent)\nr = 0.30\n"

The median expected growth rate is 1.7 percent. Exhibit 9 represents the three-year sales \ngrowth rates, adjusted for inflation, which analysts expect for ten companies with sales in excess of $50 billion. \nWe superimposed the expected growth rates on the distribution of historical sales growth rates for the \nreference class of mega companies. \n \nExhibit 9: Three-Year Expected Sales Growth Rates for Ten Mega Companies \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT\u00ae and FactSet Estimates.  \nNote: FactSet consensus estimates as of February 19, 2016; Growth rates are annualized; P&G = Procter & Gamble, IBM = International Business \nMachines, and GE = General Electric. \n \nAnalysts expect negative sales growth for four of the ten, which corporate actions or commodity prices can \nlargely explain.

Implicit in such a \nvariant perception is a forecast of outcomes that is at odds with what the market price implies. \n \nResearch shows that optimism and overconfidence can creep into our forecasts and distort them. This is \nespecially pronounced when the outcomes have personal relevance. Research also shows that incorporating a \nbase rate can improve the quality of our forecasts. Notwithstanding the utility of this method, it remains \nsubstantially underutilized. \n \nIn this piece we provide the base rates for sales growth rates for a large sample of global companies over a \nspan of more than six decades.
