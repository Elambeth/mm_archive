The idea is to get more than what you pay for. The \npresent value of the cash flows the business can distribute over its \nlifetime determines the ultimate value. The market\u2019s expectation for \nthose cash flows sets the price. \nYou need to understand how a business works and what its \nprospects are to get a handle on future cash flows. Core to that \nunderstanding is an assessment of how much a company invests \nand the return those investments are likely to earn. Companies \ncreate value when the return on their investments exceeds the \nopportunity cost of the capital they deploy. \nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) is one way to measure whether \na company\u2019s earnings are sufficient relative to the capital it has \ninvested. ROIC measures net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) \nas a percentage of invested capital. NOPAT is the cash earnings \nof the business independent of how it finances its operations. \nInvested capital is an estimate of how much capital the company is \nemploying to generate those earnings. The spread between ROIC \nand the cost of capital provides insight into whether a company is \ngenerating value.  \nWe recently wrote a report called \u201cReturn on Invested Capital: How \nto Calculate ROIC and Handle Common Issues\u201d that covered \ncalculations and other considerations.1 We also showed empirical \ndata for the Russell 3000 Index, which includes approximately \n3,000 U.S. public companies. Data included the distribution of \nROICs, aggregate ROICs over time, and ROICs by industry. We \nalso showed a chart of the components of ROIC, NOPAT margin \n(NOPAT/sales) and invested capital turnover (sales/invested \ncapital), for the top 500 companies in the index to highlight the \npotential source of competitive advantage.2  \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

This adjustment takes part of \nselling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense and reclassifies it as an investment. As a consequence, \nNOPAT and invested capital both increase. The reclassification does not affect free cash flow, the main driver of \ncorporate value, but it does provide a more accurate view of profits and investments. \nOur discussion of how to make this intangible adjustment was limited to a couple of case studies. In this short \nreport, we extend the analysis by capitalizing intangible investments for the full universe. We explain the \nmethodology in the appendix, but the percentage of SG&A that is deemed to be an intangible investment, and \nthe assumptions about the appropriate asset lives, are tailored to each industry. This work allows us to place the \ntraditional and adjusted figures side by side and see the impact the modification has on relevant financial metrics. \nThe main result is that extremely high and low ROICs regress toward the mean.3 \nEmpirical Data \nExhibit 1 shows the distributions of ROICs for the Russell 3000, excluding the financial and real estate sectors, \nusing the traditional and adjusted approaches. The median ROIC in 2021 following the adjustment is 8.96 \npercent, which is only slightly higher than the traditional ROIC of 8.84 percent. The update doesn\u2019t move the \nmedian much.    \nExhibit 1: Distributions of ROICs for the Russell 3000, 1990-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate. \nBut the bins with the lowest ROICs (far left) and highest ROICs (far right) have fewer companies in them after \nthe adjustment. The low-return bin goes from 8 percent of the sample with the traditional calculation to 4 percent \nafter the adjustment. Likewise, the high-return bin goes from 11 percent (traditional) to 8 percent (adjusted). This \nshows that the intangible adjustment pushes the outliers toward the average and reduces the dispersion relative \nto the traditional calculation.  \nFor companies with high ROICs, the adjustment to NOPAT is less significant than that for invested capital. As a \nresult, the revised ROIC is pulled down. The adjustment to NOPAT has more impact than that for invested capital \nfor firms with low ROICs, which lifts the modified ROIC.  \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n<(20)\n(20)-(15) (15)-(10) (10)-(5)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n25-30\n>30\nFrequency (Percent of Total)\nROIC (Percent)\nTraditional\nAdjusted\n"

The aggregate ROIC is total \nNOPAT divided by total average invested capital for the relevant companies in the Russell 3000 for each year. \nThe series track one another quite closely. The traditional figures have an average annual return of 9.4 percent \nversus 9.1 percent for the adjusted calculation. The traditional ROICs are also less volatile, with a standard \ndeviation of 1.4 compared to 1.7 for the adjusted ROICs. \nExhibit 2: Aggregate Traditional and Adjusted ROICs for the Russell 3000, 1990-2021 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate. \nExhibit 3 breaks down annual ROICs by quintile using the traditional (left panel) and adjusted (right panel) \ncalculations. We allow the universe to reshuffle each year. While the middle three quintiles appear similar, the \nhighest and lowest quintiles have outcomes that are less extreme in the adjusted calculation. This is consistent \nwith the reduction in dispersion after reflecting intangible investments.    \nSome academics have pointed out the emergence of \u201csuperstar\u201d firms, which have distanced themselves from \ntheir industry peers in measures such as markups and ROIC.4 A markup captures the difference between the \nprice a company can charge for a good or service and its marginal cost. A positive markup allows a company to \nearn an economic profit, measured as ROIC less the cost of capital multiplied by invested capital. \nThe distinction between the superstar firms and their peers shrinks significantly after reflecting intangible \ninvestments because the adjustment lowers markups and ROICs. This suggests the possibility that rather than \nbeing extreme outliers, as the traditional analysis of markups and ROIC indicates, superstar firms may earn a \nreturn on their tangible and intangible investments that is only modestly higher than that of their peers.5 \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nROIC (Percent)\nTraditional\nAdjusted\n"

The mix between tangible \nand intangible investment determines the magnitude of the impact. Capitalizing intangible investments lifts the \nROIC and reduces the range of outcomes for industries that rely heavily on intangible investments. The impact \nof the adjustment is modest for industries that do not spend much on intangibles. \nExhibit 4 shows the median ROIC for 52 non-financial industries, as defined by the Global Industry Classification \nStandard, calculated in the traditional fashion (top panel) and after adjusting for intangible investments (bottom \npanel). It also shows the ROICs for the companies in the 20th and 80th percentiles as an indication of dispersion. \nWe maintained the order of the industries to show the contrast between results before and after the adjustment.     \nA comparison of the two calculations shows that the ROICs are higher after the adjustment for industries such \nas biotechnology, internet software & services, and internet & catalog retail. Other industries, such as utilities, \nsee very little change.   \nThe exhibit provides additional evidence that the adjustment shrinks dispersion. This effect is more pronounced \nin industries that rely heavily on intangible investments than it is for businesses based on tangible assets. For \none half of the industries where the 20th percentile company had a negative ROIC using the traditional \ncalculation, the result flipped to positive following the adjustment. The other half were just barely negative. \nCapitalizing intangible investments makes the highs lower and the lows higher. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\nMedian ROIC (Percent)\nTraditional\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\n2020\nMedian ROIC (Percent)\nAdjusted\n"

A company that achieves an \nattractive level of ROIC by earning a high NOPAT margin often does so by pricing its good or service at a premium \nto competitors. This is a differentiation strategy. A firm that earns a high ROIC by having high invested capital \nturnover, a measure of capital efficiency, can provide its offering at a relatively low price. This is a cost-leadership \nstrategy. The path a company takes to an attractive ROIC can guide analysis of competitive strategy.  \nExhibit 5 shows a scatter plot of the top 500 companies in the Russell 3000 as measured by sales. The horizontal \n(x) axis is the NOPAT margin and the vertical (y) axis is the invested capital turnover. The product of these equals \nROIC, which means that the ROICs are lower in the bottom left corner than they are in the top right corner. \nCompanies in the bottom right section of the chart can be said to pursue a differentiation strategy and those in \nthe top left a cost-leadership strategy.  \nThe dots in the chart are the results calculated using the traditional approach. The triangles are the same universe \nbut adjusted for intangibles. In general, the adjustment for intangible investment leads to higher NOPAT and \nhigher invested capital. Since both are considered relative to sales, which does not change, the NOPAT margin \ngoes up and the invested capital turnover goes down. Said differently, the adjustment pulls companies toward \nthe bottom right of the chart. As a result, you see more circles in the upper left section of the chart and more \ntriangles in the bottom right.   \nExhibit 5: Traditional and Adjusted Drivers of ROIC, Top 500 Companies in Russell 3000, 2021 \n \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Top 500 companies by 2021 sales; Excludes financials and real estate; Truncated axes for visualization. \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nInvested Capital Turnover (x)\nNOPAT Margin (Percent)\nDifferentiation\nCost Leadership\n\u25cfTraditional\n\u25b2Adjusted\n"

This is because accountants are \nuncertain about the sales that these investments may generate. So, in order to be conservative, they do not apply \nthe matching principle and simply expense the outlays. \nThis difference in accounting treatment makes the business analyst\u2019s task more difficult. One way to get a more \nconsistent view of investment and return on investment is to handle all investments in the same way. That means \ntreating intangible investments the same as tangible investments. \nThis is easy to say but hard to implement. The reason is that it is a challenge to know what amount of SG&A \nreflects maintenance spending, which is required to sustain current sales, and what amount is a discretionary \ninvestment in pursuit of value-creating growth. Even after an analyst makes the judgment about the split between \nmaintenance and discretionary spending, there is the issue of the appropriate asset life. \nWe recently wrote a report discussing how to calculate ROIC and some of the challenges in estimating NOPAT \nand invested capital. We also discussed how to capitalize intangible investments and shared two case studies.  \nThis report goes a step further and adjusts ROIC to reflect intangible investment for all non-financial companies \nin the Russell 3000. While the median and aggregate ROICs for the adjusted figures are similar to the traditional \nones, the big difference is that the adjusted figures have much less dispersion. \nThe adjustment for intangible investment lowers the ROIC for high-ROIC firms and raises the ROIC for low-ROIC \ncompanies. While the methods to implement these modifications remain a vibrant area of research, we believe \nthey represent a step toward a more accurate view of the magnitude and return on investment. \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 11-13 \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6112912 Exp. 11/30/2024 \n9\n \nAppendix: Methodology to Adjust for Intangible Investment \nHere is how we adjust our calculations of ROIC to account for intangible investments.  \nThe first step is to acknowledge that some percentage of SG&A expense is properly considered an intangible \ninvestment. These intangible investments are discretionary and are in pursuit of growth that creates value. \nSpecifically, there are two issues: determining how much of SG&A is an intangible investment and designating \nan appropriate asset life. Once these two parts are in place, we can reflect intangible investments on the balance \nsheet and amortize them over their useful lives. In other words, we account for intangible investments the same \nway as we do for capital expenditures. \nMost academics make this adjustment by following the approach described by two professors of finance, Ryan \nPeters and Lucian Taylor.6 They suggest treating all of research and development (R&D) expense, and 30 \npercent of non-R&D SG&A expense, as an intangible investment.  \nThere are two potential limitations to the Peters and Taylor approach. The first is that it does not recognize that \nsome of R&D expense may actually be required to maintain current operations. The second is that it does not \ncapture the possibility that the portion of the R&D expense and non-R&D SG&A expense that is an intangible \ninvestment may vary by industry.  \nTo address those limitations, we use the approach described by Aneel Iqbal, a PhD candidate in accounting, and \nShivaram Rajgopal, Anup Srivastava, and Rong Zhao, professors of accounting.7 They estimate capitalization \nrates and useful lives for R&D and non-R&D SG&A for each of the Fama-French industries. The amortization \nrate is then calculated as 1/useful life. For example, if R&D has an estimated useful life of 5 years, the investment \namount is reflected on the balance sheet and 20 percent (1/5) is amortized each year over the asset\u2019s life. \nWe apply these estimates to companies in the Russell 3000 based on their Fama-French industry.8 We use the \nperpetual inventory method to estimate the net capitalized intangible assets for each year.9 This leads to an \nupward adjustment in invested capital. \nThe annual change in net capitalized intangible assets equals our estimate of net intangible investments. The \nresult is an increase in NOPAT in most cases. \nThe formula for net capitalized intangible assets, the sum we add to invested capital, is:  \n  \nThe formula for net intangible investments, the sum we add to traditional NOPAT, is:  \n \n \n \n \n \nWe assume a 7 percent growth rate for R&D and non-R&D SG&A, which is the historical growth rate of both \namounts within the Russell 3000 from 1990-2021. Varying the growth rate does not materially change our \naggregate results. \n \nR&Dyear0 x Capitalization rate of R&D  \nGrowth rate of R&D + Amortization rate of R&D \nNon-R&D SG&Ayear0 x Capitalization rate of non-R&D SG&A \nGrowth rate of non-R&D SG&A + Amortization rate of non-R&D SG&A \n+ \nR&Dyear-1 x Capitalization rate of R&D  \nGrowth rate of R&D + Amortization rate of R&D \nNon-R&D SG&Ayear-1 x Capitalization rate of non-R&D SG&A \nGrowth rate of non-R&D SG&A + Amortization rate of non-R&D SG&A \n+ \n\u0336 \nR&Dyear-1 x Capitalization rate of R&D  \nGrowth rate of R&D + Amortization rate of R&D \nNon-R&D SG&Ayear-1 x Capitalization rate of non-R&D SG&A \nGrowth rate of non-R&D SG&A + Amortization rate of non-R&D SG&A \n+ \n"

Mauboussin and Dan Callahan, \u201cReturn on Invested Capital: How to Calculate ROIC and Handle \nCommon Issues,\u201d Consilient Observer: Counterpoint Global Insights, October 6, 2022. \n2 NOPAT margin is defined as NOPAT/Sales and invested capital turnover is defined as Invested Capital/Sales. \nWhen you multiply the terms, sales cancel out and you are left with NOPAT/Invested Capital. A high margin and \naverage invested capital turnover are associated with a differentiation strategy, while an average margin and \nhigh invested capital turnover are consistent with a cost leadership strategy. \n3 Here\u2019s the intuition. For all companies, the adjustment increases NOPAT and investment, net of amortization, \nfor any particular year by the same amount. But the calculation of invested capital also reflects the sum of past \nintangible investments net of amortization. For companies with ROICs that are high, the incremental increase in \nNOPAT is small relative to the increase in invested capital.  \nIn our prior report we illustrated the point with numbers from Microsoft, a multinational technology company. The \ncompany\u2019s traditional ROIC for fiscal 2022 is 49 percent, or $70 billion in NOPAT divided by $143 billion of \naverage invested capital. The adjustment adds an ROIC of 11 percent, or $10 billion to NOPAT and $90 billion \nto average invested capital. You can think about it as starting with the high-return part (49% = 70/143) and adding \na low-return part (11% = 10/90) to get an adjusted total of 34 percent (34% = 80/233). \nNow take Snowflake, a cloud computing-based data warehousing company. The traditional ROIC for fiscal 2022 \nis -416 percent, or -$704 million in NOPAT divided by $169 million in average invested capital. This young \ncompany\u2019s heavy investment shows up on the income statement. The adjustment adds an ROIC of 51 percent. \nYou can think about it as starting with a low-return part (-416% = -704/169) and adding a high-return part (51% \n= 756/1,490) to get an adjusted total of 3 percent (3% = 52/1,659).  \nIn both cases, the adjusted number is closer to the average than the traditional one.  \n4 David Autor, David Dorn, Lawrence F.
