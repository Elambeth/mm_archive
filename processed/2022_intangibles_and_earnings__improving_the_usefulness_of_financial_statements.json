The Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct of 2002 requires the chief executive officer and chief financial \nofficer of a U.S. public company to certify that the firm\u2019s financial \nstatements are true and without material omissions, and to present \nfairly the operations and financial condition. The executives must \nalso certify that the necessary internal controls are in place to make \nsure that that they receive material information.  \nIn recent decades, the ability to interpret financial statements has \nbeen complicated by the shift from tangible to intangible \ninvestments.1 Tangible assets are physical, such as factories or \ntrucks. Intangible assets are non-physical and include brand-\nbuilding or employee training. \nThis is a problem because accountants primarily reflect tangible \ninvestments on the balance sheet and intangible investments on \nthe income statement.2 Tangible assets are depreciated over their \nuseful lives, which shows up as an expense on the income \nstatement. And intangibles are recorded on the balance sheet and \namortized only following an acquisition. But that today\u2019s \ninvestments do not show up in the same spots as in the past means \nthat financial statements do not provide the same information. \nA sensible solution to this challenge is to capitalize the investments \nthat appear on the income statement and amortize them over their \nuseful lives. This means treating an intangible investment the same \nas a tangible investment. But this raises two big questions: which \nincome statement items are appropriately considered investments \nand what is a proper useful life for those assets?  \nThis report takes up those questions by leveraging recent \nacademic research. The main finding is that one size does not fit \nall. These adjustments recast profitability for some companies and \nare inconsequential for others.3 Overall, we estimate that earnings \nfor the S&P 500 would be about 12 percent higher with \nconsideration of these changes.      \n \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Earnings on the income statement are what accountants call a \u201cflow,\u201d which measures a result \nover time. Investment on the balance sheet is a \u201cstock,\u201d which is a snapshot at a period of time. Some valuation \ntechniques rely more on flow, including multiples of price-to-earnings (P/E) and enterprise value-to-earnings \nbefore interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA). Others are based on stock, such as the ratio \nof price-to-book value (P/B). \nEarnings equal revenues minus expenses for a particular period. Companies and investors commonly fiddle \nwith expenses, for example excluding certain items in the hope of adding clarity. But the idea is reasonably \nstraightforward.4 \nInvestments are outlays in the present that are expected to generate earnings in the future. An investment is \nworthwhile if the present value of the future earnings is higher than the cost. Tangible investments for a particular \nperiod show up on the statement of cash flows, and the cumulative amount shows up as assets on the balance \nsheet. Companies record depreciation as a cost on the income statement to match the use of the asset with its \nexpense. The amount of annual depreciation reflects the asset\u2019s estimated life.  \nIntangible investments appear as an expense in the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) section of the \nincome statement. Intangible investments are also recorded on the balance sheet but only when they are \nacquired. Accountants amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives in the same way that \nthey depreciate tangible assets. Absent an acquisition, intangible investments are recorded solely as an \nexpense. \nThese accounting conventions mean that figuring out what goes into the earnings and investment piles can be \ntricky and misleading. This is especially relevant when investors rely on shorthands to do their valuation work. \nWe now look at how this sorting affects the metrics that practitioners use to value businesses. \nDiscounted Cash Flow. In theory, the value of a financial asset is the present value of future free cash flows. \nBecause free cash flow considers earnings and investments, moving items from one pile to the other does not \naffect the outcome. For example, assume you examined a company and calculated that its earnings were $250 \nand its investment was $100. Free cash flow would be $150 ($250 - $100).  \nIn studying the company further, you conclude that $100 of investments were recorded on the income statement. \nYou move $100 from one pile to the other as a result. Earnings are now $350 and the investment is $200. Free \ncash flow remains $150 ($350 - $200), but the path to get there is different.  \nSorting the earnings and investment may not appear to be worthwhile if you come up with the same answer. \nBut, in fact, understanding the magnitude and return on investment provides vital clues about a business\u2019s capital \nintensity and future earnings.  \nThis adjustment can also have an impact on a discounted cash flow model that uses a continuing value to \nestimate the contribution of the cash flows beyond an explicit forecast period. Estimates of continuing value are \ngenerally based on earnings. Common approaches include capitalizing net operating profit after taxes or \napplying a multiple of EBITDA. Continuing value increases to the degree to which the adjusted earnings are \nhigher than the unadjusted earnings.5  \n \n"

A survey of nearly 2,000 professional fundamental investors revealed that nearly 93 \npercent use multiples to value businesses.6 The most popular multiples are P/E and EV/EBITDA. Earnings can \nbe misrepresented for businesses that invest heavily via the income statement. \nTake Amazon as an example.7 The company\u2019s enterprise value at the end of 2021 was approximately $1.725 \ntrillion, and its EBITDA was $59.2 billion ($24.9 billion in EBIT and $34.3 billion in DA). Reclassifying $60.1 billion \nin expenses as investments increases net income from $33.4 billion to $61.5 billion, effectively doubles EBITDA, \nand lifts investments by almost 90 percent.8 Provided these adjustments present a more accurate portrait of the \ncompany\u2019s financial situation, the P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples are substantially lower than the traditional \ncalculations suggest. \nIn a moment, we will show that the consequence of this adjustment varies widely. But it should be clear that a \nsimplistic comparison of multiples from one company to the next is fraught with the danger of false conclusions.9 \nResearch shows that earnings are less relevant and informative today than they were in the past.10 That means \nthat multiples, which seek to serve as a shorthand for the proper valuation process, are often not up to the task \nof discerning value and value creation. \nMultiples of Investment (via Book Value). Over the last six decades, academics have worked on models to \nexplain risk and returns for asset prices. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is the best known of these and \nposits a linear relationship between risk and expected return.11 Risk in this case is defined as the standard \ndeviation of returns. \nShortly after the CAPM was specified, it became clear that the model had a limited ability to explain returns. In \nthe early 1990s, the finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French developed a better model to explain \nreturns that included the CAPM but added a size premium and a value premium.12 The size premium reflects \nthe observation that small-capitalization stocks have delivered higher returns than what the CAPM predicts. The \nvalue premium captures the fact that the returns of cheap stocks have been higher, and the returns of expensive \nstocks have been lower, than the estimates generated by the CAPM.13  \nThe value factor seeks to harvest the value premium.14 The classic setup is to create a portfolio that is long the \ncheapest stocks and short the most expensive ones. There are various ways to define value, but Fama and \nFrench used the P/B ratio. One of the benefits of this ratio is that it is more stable than multiples of earnings.15 \nThere is a direct link between the investment pile and book value. Tangible investments are recorded on the \nasset side of the balance sheet. For instance, a new machine for manufacturing shows up as property, plant, \nand equipment (PP&E). Assets minus liabilities equal shareholders\u2019 equity. Liabilities are predominately debt. \nDivide shareholders\u2019 equity by the shares outstanding and you get book value per share. \nThe ratio of price to book value reflects the level at which shareholders are willing to buy or sell their shares \ndivided by the value on the balance sheet that is attributable to shareholders. The problem with this method of \nvaluation is that book value will be lower than it should be if the investment pile is understated. In turn, that will \naffect ratios of price to book and distort the results of this metric. \nIf the shift from tangible to intangible investment is meaningful, we would expect a weakening of the signal from \nthe value factor. This is what we have seen.16 As important, the signal from the value factor improves when \nintangibles are reflected as investments.17 This result is well understood by academics and practitioners. In other \nwords, accurately sorting the earnings and investment piles improves this approach to valuation. \n"

The shift from tangible to intangible investment has left shorthand \nvaluation methods less useful because the earnings and investment piles are not sorted as well as they could \nbe. The accounting conventions we now follow, which are understandably conservative, fail to provide the \ninformation that managers and investors need to make knowledgeable choices about a company. \nHow to Sort Earnings and Investments \nThe solution to the problem of how to sort the earnings and investment piles more accurately is to record \ninvestments that are part of SG&A on the balance sheet and then amortize them over their useful lives. This \ntreats the intangible investments that a company expenses the same as the tangible investments that it \ncapitalizes.  \nHere\u2019s an illustration to make the idea more concrete. Company A buys a machine for $1,000 that has an \nestimated useful life of 5 years. The present value of expected cash flows is $1,500. Company B spends $1,000 \nto acquire a subscriber who is expected to remain a customer for 5 years. The present value of the customer\u2019s \nexpected cash flows is $1,500. \nThe economic profile of these investments is identical but their accounting treatment is different. Company A \nrecords the machine as PP&E and depreciates $200 a year for 5 years. Company B immediately reflects the \n$1,000 customer acquisition as an expense in SG&A. Note that Company B will \u201close\u201d more in earnings the \nfaster it grows, even though acquiring customers creates value. We want a solution that sorts the earnings and \ninvestment piles in the same way. \nAcademics who study this topic seek to understand the impact of capitalizing investments from the income \nstatement for a large sample of companies. As a result, they frequently use 100 percent of research and \ndevelopment (R&D), and 30 percent of non-R&D SG&A, to estimate investment. They also assume a standard \nasset life.18 This is a step in the right direction but is a blunt tool. Business analysts recognize that the investment \ncomponent of SG&A varies widely by industry and company. Investors buying and selling companies based on \ntheir fundamental outlooks must reflect these differences in their assessments. \nIn 2018, Luminita Enache and Anup Srivastava, professors of accounting, published a paper that posed the \nquestion at hand in the title: \u201cShould Intangible Investments Be Reported Separately or Commingled with \nOperating Expenses?\u201d19 They show the significance of the rise of intangible investments over time and develop \na method for estimating the magnitude of intangible investment. Their analysis reveals that the relevance of this \naccounting issue varies widely.  \nA straightforward description of their approach is that they figured out a way to separate SG&A expenses into \nmaintenance and investment parts. Maintenance SG&A expenses are necessary for the company to sustain its \ncurrent operations. Investment SG&A expenses are in pursuit of growth that creates value. In effect, they provide \na method to make the earnings and investment piles more accurate than standard financial statements do. \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5626157 Exp. 4/30/2024 \n5 \n \nThe Impact of Intangibles on Earnings and Book Value  \nWe now discuss a framework to measure the impact of these adjustments on earnings. But before we do that, \nwe need to address the nature of the adjustments in more detail. This requires judgment about what percentage \nof SG&A expense is an investment and what are the appropriate asset lives. \nAneel Iqbal, a doctoral candidate in accounting, and Shivaram Rajgopal, Anup Srivastava, and Rong Zhao, \nprofessors of accounting, developed a method to guide these assumptions.20 Using a regression methodology, \nthey examined 42 industries and specified the investment portion of SG&A expenses. They separated SG&A \ninto two parts: Main SG&A, which is the SG&A expense less R&D, and R&D expense. Note that most \nresearchers have historically deemed all of R&D expense to be a discretionary intangible investment.21 \nConsistent with prior work, they find large variance across industries (see Appendix A).22 Specifically, they \nanswer two questions: \n\u2022 What percentage of SG&A expense is an investment? Their analysis finds that between 0 and 80 \npercent of Main SG&A is an investment across the range of industries, with an average of 54 percent. \nThey estimate that a range of 7 to 98 percent of R&D expense is an investment, with a mean of 76 percent. \nNote that many executives struggle to answer the question of how their SG&A expense breaks down \nbetween maintenance and investment spending. \n\u2022 What is an appropriate asset life? Tangible assets have an average life of around ten years. Because \nwe are capitalizing SG&A as we would a tangible investment, we must have a sense of asset lives to \nproperly amortize them. Iqbal et al. judge the useful life of Main SG&A investments to be 0.25 to 5 years, \nwith an average of 3.3 years. The useful lives for R&D investments range from 0.5 to 7 years, with a mean \nof 4.4 years.  \nFinally, we need to estimate the growth in investment SG&A in order to measure the impact of the adjustments. \nGrowth affects the difference in the timing between the removed expense and added amortization. Consider a \ncase where 30 percent of $1,000 of SG&A is deemed to be an intangible investment with a 3-year life, and that \namount of SG&A does not grow. Eventually, the company will be capitalizing $300, hence removing it from \nSG&A expense, and amortizing $300 (the last 3 years of investment with $100 of annual amortization expense \nfor each), adding to SG&A expense. The net effect on SG&A and earnings is therefore zero.  \nIf you assume SG&A expense grows at 10 percent and all else remains the same, the net effect is a 5.1 percent \nreduction in annual SG&A expense and an increase in investment in the same amount. Growth opens the gap \nbetween the current investment expensed and the amortization of past investments. Note that it does not matter \nif the growth is the result of inflation.     \nEarnings that are reclassified as an investment also increase book value. The adjustment increases assets, \nliabilities remain the same, and shareholders\u2019 equity has to be revised up to maintain the balance on the balance \nsheet. Iqbal et al. estimate that the change in book value by industry ranges from 4 to 95 percent, with an \naverage increase of 49 percent (see Appendix B). \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n5626157 Exp. 4/30/2024 \n6 \n \nTwo Case Studies and the S&P 500 \nHere are two case studies to illustrate the impact that capitalizing and amortizing part of SG&A have on earnings. \nWe selected actual companies that represent industries at the extremes. One is in the pharmaceutical products \nindustry, where the investment portion of SG&A is high, and the other is in the business supplies industry, where \nthe investment portion of SG&A is low. We then look at the S&P 500 using a weighted average of all industries. \nWe start with pharmaceutical products. Iqbal et al. find that 68 percent of Main SG&A and 89 percent of R&D \nare investments and that asset lives are 4.2 years for Main SG&A and 4.5 years for R&D. Based on the \ncompany\u2019s mix of Main SG&A and R&D, we estimate that 75 percent of SG&A should be capitalized with a \nuseful life of 4 years. We assume the growth rate will be 30 percent.  \nExhibit 1 summarizes how these adjustments affect margins. The operating profit margin goes from -0.9 percent \nto 14.6 percent, a huge 1550 basis point swing. Applying these changes takes operating profit from a modest \nloss to a solid gain.  \nExhibit 1: Impact of Capitalizing SG&A on the Margins of a Pharmaceutical Company \n \nEarnings Measure \nUnadjusted Margin \nAdjusted Margin \nEBITDA \n9.1% \n24.6% \nOperating Profit \n-0.9% \n14.6% \nNet Income \n-16.8% \n-1.3% \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global estimates for fiscal year 2021. \nNext we turn to business supplies. Iqbal et al. find that only 11 percent of Main SG&A and 83 percent of R&D \nare investments and that asset lives are 4.9 years for both Main SG&A and R&D. Based on the company\u2019s mix \nof Main SG&A and R&D, we estimate that 15 percent of SG&A should be capitalized with a useful life of 5 years. \nR&D is a modest percentage of overall SG&A, unlike pharmaceuticals. We assume the growth rate will be 5 \npercent. \nExhibit 2 shows that these adjustments lift the operating profit margin by about 50 basis points, from 3.4 to 4.0 \npercent (there is a tiny amount of rounding). If accurate, these modifications have an immaterial impact on how \nearnings and investments are sorted.   \nExhibit 2: Impact of Capitalizing SG&A on the Margins of a Business Supplies Company \n \nEarnings Measure \nUnadjusted Margin \nAdjusted Margin \nEBITDA \n6.7% \n7.2% \nOperating Profit \n3.4% \n4.0% \nNet Income \n1.0% \n1.5% \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global estimates for fiscal year 2021. \nThe effect of these modifications for the S&P 500 falls between these extremes. We assume that 60 percent of \nSG&A should be capitalized with a useful life of 4 years and that the growth rate will be 6 percent.  \nThe operating profit margin increases 145 basis points, from 15.2 to 16.7 percent (see exhibit 3). There is a \nproportionate lift in net income of 11.8 percent, which comes out to about $170 billion. Applying the S&P 500\u2019s \nP/E ratio to this sum yields $3.0-3.5 trillion, about one-tenth of the index\u2019s market capitalization.  \n"

This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings. \nInvestors often use a multiple of earnings or book value as a shorthand for measuring the present value of future \nfree cash flows. As a result, sorting earnings from investments is useful. Most intangible investments appear on \nthe income statement. Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures. \nThe result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount. This leaves free cash flow unchanged \nbut provides a more accurate picture of a company\u2019s operations. \nAcademics and practitioners are aware of this accounting quirk and make adjustments to improve the usefulness \nof financial data. But it is common to capitalize a similar percentage of SG&A for all companies, which obscures \nimportant differences between industries and the companies within them.     \nIn this report, we apply a framework for categorizing earnings and investments based on recent academic \nresearch. We show that there is significant variance between industries, which is important for investors who \nrely predominately on multiples for valuation. Adjustments to the financial statements of a pair of companies \nshowed a huge operating profit margin expansion for the one that is intangible intensive and an insignificant \nchange for the one that is tangible intensive. \nGiven the assumptions we use, the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the S&P \n500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported. These figures suggest great caution in comparing \nearnings or multiples over time. \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 12-14   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
