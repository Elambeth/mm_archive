We will use data on \ncash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae) to explain the process for corporate performance, but you can use \nthe approach for other value drivers as well. We address two central issues: the rate of reversion to the mean \nand the mean to which the results revert. HOLT\u00ae users recognize these issues as the basis for fade.1 \n \nMost investors know about reversion to the mean and think that they take it into account as they model \ncorporate performance. But in reality few deal with it properly. Further, results show that investors in the \naggregate do not behave as if they understand the concept.2 Reversion to the mean is so tricky that it has \neven caused prominent economists to stumble.3   \n \nSecrist\u2019s Mistakes \n \nIn 1933, Horace Secrist, a statistician at Northwestern University, published a book called The Triumph of \nMediocrity in Business. The title accurately reveals the content. Secrist summarized his argument, which was \naccompanied by more than 100 charts, by writing, \u201cMediocrity tends to prevail in the conduct of competitive \nbusiness.\u201d4  \n \nThe idea derives from the principles of microeconomics and makes sense. It says that companies earning high \neconomic profits will draw competition, driving their returns lower over time, and that companies earning low \nreturns will see investment flee, allowing economic profits to drift higher.5 As Secrist wrote, \u201cBoth \nadvantageous and disadvantageous conditions are continuously dissipated\u2014equalization is in process.\u201d  \n \nSecrist\u2019s analysis seems to be a classic and somewhat intuitive example of reversion to the mean. But \nstatisticians now use Secrist\u2019s book as one of the most famous examples of a failure to understand reversion \nto the mean.6 Academics, including economists, initially received the book warmly. But a scathing review by a \nstatistician and economist at Columbia University named Harold Hotelling set the record straight.7 \n \nReversion to the mean says that an outcome that is far from average will be followed by an outcome with an \nexpected value closer to the average. Here\u2019s an example to make the idea clearer. Say a teacher assigns her \nstudents 100 pieces of information to study, and one particular student learns 80 of them. The teacher then \ncreates a test by randomly selecting 20 pieces of information. On average, the student will score an 80, but it \nis possible\u2014albeit extremely unlikely\u2014that he will score 100 or 0.  \n \nAssume he scores 90. You could say that his skill contributed 80 and that good luck added 10. Assuming the \nfollowing test has the same setup, what score would you expect? The answer, of course, is 80. You could \nassume that his skill of 80 would persist and that his luck, which is transitory, would be zero. Naturally, there\u2019s \nno way to know if luck will be zero. In fact, the student may get luckier on the second test. On average, \nhowever, the student\u2019s score will be closer to his skill.  \n \nBuilding on our example, there will be reversion to the mean whenever luck plays a role in determining \noutcomes. Luck in this case derives from the questions the teacher selects for the test. But even something \nas simple as measurement error can introduce luck. Saying it differently, whenever there is an imperfect \ncorrelation between two scores, you will have reversion to the mean. \n \nWe can now look at Secrist\u2019s argument and see the mistakes that Hotelling points out. The first is assuming \ncausality. We naturally look for what is causing results to revert to the mean. For example, Secrist writes, \u201cThe \n"

It is expressive of prevailing behavior \nrelations.\u201d Secrist suggests directly that competition is causing returns to revert toward the mean. Hotelling \ncalls Secrist\u2019s conclusion a \u201cstatistical fallacy\u201d and adds, \u201cThese diagrams really prove nothing more than that \nthe ratios in question have a tendency to wander about.\u201d This is not to say that there aren\u2019t causal factors, but \nwe don\u2019t need them to observe reversion to the mean.8 \n \nThe other mistake is to assume declining variance in the population, as captured in Secrist\u2019s phrase \n\u201cmediocrity tends to prevail.\u201d It is crucial to recognize that reversion to the mean doesn\u2019t provide specific \nguidance for any individual outcome, but rather it operates on a population. While luck may be zero on average, \nit is good for some and bad for others. Luck is shuffled and can exert the same influence on the overall result \nfrom one period to the next.  \n \nThe student who scored 90 on the first test may score an 80 on the second as his good luck runs out, but a \nstudent with similar qualifications who scored an 80 the first time may enjoy good luck the second time and \nscore 90. The distribution for the population need not change at all. This is one of the reasons reversion to the \nmean is so difficult to appreciate. Change, in the apparent form of high and low results getting closer to the \nmean over time, co-exists with no change, where the population\u2019s distribution remains constant.      \n  \nWe will turn our attention to business performance in a moment, but let\u2019s first look at a classic case of \nreversion to the mean, the heights of fathers and sons, to illustrate the mistakes that Secrist made. Exhibit 1 \nshows the heights of more than 1,000 fathers and sons relative to the average of each population.  \n \nThe left side of the exhibit shows reversion to the mean. Tall fathers have tall sons, but the tallest fathers are \nabout eight inches taller than the average of all fathers while the tallest sons are only about four inches taller \nthan the average of all sons. The mirror image is true as well: Short fathers tend to have short sons, but the \ndifference between the short fathers and the average of all fathers is larger than the same difference for the \nsons. All of this squares with intuition.  \n \nExhibit 1: Heights of Fathers and Sons, and Sons and Fathers \n \nSource: Karl Pearson and Alice Lee, \u201cOn the Laws of Inheritance in Man: I.

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 17, 2013  \nHow to Model Reversion to the Mean \n4 \n \nBut reversion to the mean implies something that doesn\u2019t make as much sense: Because the phenomenon is \nthe result of imperfect correlation, the arrow of time doesn\u2019t matter. So tall sons have tall fathers, but the sons \nhave a greater difference between their heights and the average than their fathers do. The same relationship \nis true for short sons and fathers. The right side of Exhibit 1 shows this.  \n \nThat the arrow of time can point in either direction reveals the risk of falsely attributing causality. While it may \nbe true that tall fathers cause tall sons, it makes no sense to say that tall sons cause tall fathers. We find it \ndifficult to refrain from assigning causality, even though reversion to the mean doesn\u2019t require it.9  \n \nReversion to the mean conveys the sense that the difference between the extremes and the average shrinks \nover time. But that sense is deceptive. The way to think about it is that the values that are far from average \nbasically have nowhere to go but toward the average, and the values that are close to average don\u2019t show \nmuch change in the aggregate as large moves up and down cancel out one another. Secrist observed the \nmeans of the groups converge and hence assumed that there was more \u201cmediocrity\u201d at the end of the period \nthan at the beginning. Hotelling bluntly responds that, \u201cThe argument that business ratios converge because \nthe means of initially arrayed groups converge is definitely incorrect.\u201d    \n \nAn examination of the dispersion of values is the best way to evaluate whether the distribution has changed. \nYou can do that by measuring the standard deviation of the distribution or, even better, the coefficient of \nvariation. A normalized measure of dispersion, the coefficient of variation equals the standard deviation divided \nby the mean. Exhibit 2 shows the distribution of the heights of fathers and sons. While the distributions are \ndifferent at the top, the tails are remarkably similar. The coefficient of variation is nearly identical. The heights \nof the sons are no more clustered toward the average than the heights of the fathers. \n \nExhibit 2: The Distributions of Heights for Fathers and Sons Are Nearly Identical \n \nSource: Karl Pearson and Alice Lee, \"On the Laws of Inheritance in Man: I.

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 17, 2013  \nHow to Model Reversion to the Mean \n6 \n \nTo get the answer, you need to examine three lines in the graph: \n \uf402\n The fitted regression line minimizes the sums of the squares of the vertical deviations of each data point \nfrom the line. In other words, you can\u2019t draw a line that is closer to each data point, on average, than the \nfitted regression line. \n \uf402\n The perfect-correlation line goes through the graph at a 45 degree angle. The slope of the line\u2014rise over \nrun\u2014is 1.0. If the two data series were perfectly correlated, the fitted regression line would match the \nperfect-correlation line. \n \uf402\n The zero-correlation line runs along the x-axis. If two series were completely uncorrelated, you would see \nthe fitted regression line lie on the x-axis.    \n \nSo with visual inspection alone you can tell whether r is likely to be closer to 1.0 or zero by looking at whether \nthe fitted regression is more similar to a perfect correlation or zero correlation. (We have left out negative \ncorrelations, but the logic extends accordingly.) \n \nThe correlation coefficient, r, equals the ratio of the vertical distance between the zero-correlation and fitted \nregression line, denoted in the exhibit by the letter A, and the vertical distance between the zero- and perfect-\ncorrelation lines, denoted by the letter B. So r is a measure of how far the data are from being uncorrelated. \n \nIn this case, the fitted regression line is almost exactly in the middle of the zero- and perfect-correlation lines. \nSo the ratio is 1:2, equaling an r of 0.50. Reversion to the mean is relevant for any instance where the \ncorrelation is less than one.  \n \nEstimating the Rate of Reversion to the Mean \n \nIf r is 1.0, there is no reversion to the mean at all. The best estimate of the next outcome is the past outcome. \nYou don\u2019t often see an r that high, but one example is a ranking within a transitive activity such as running \nraces. You can line up six runners for a sprint, record their times, and rank them from fastest to slowest. If \nthat group races again immediately, the expected ranking is the same as the prior one.    \n \nIf r is zero, there is complete reversion to the mean. The best estimate of the next outcome is the mean, or \naverage, of the population. For instance, for the years 1928-2012 the correlation coefficient between the total \nreturn for the S&P 500 in one year and the return in the following year was 0.02, effectively zero. So the best \nestimate of the market\u2019s return in any given year is simply the mean annual return over the whole period.11 \n \nFor most activities, the correlation falls somewhere between those two extremes. Where it falls is essential to \nunderstanding the rate of reversion to the mean. We\u2019re now ready to examine the formula:12 \n \nExpected outcome  =  r(current outcome \u2013 mean) + mean \n \nFor example, if a father is 76 inches tall, the mean height of men is 70 inches, and the r = 0.50 between the \nheights of fathers and sons, the expected height of the son is 73 inches, determined as follows:13 \n \n            73 \n      =  0.50(76 \u2013 70) + 70 \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 17, 2013  \nHow to Model Reversion to the Mean \n7 \n \nThe relevance for forecasting should be evident. High correlations imply persistence\u2014what you see next will \nclosely resemble what you\u2019ve seen before\u2014and generally indicate the presence of skill. When the correlation \nis low, you need to rely heavily on the mean in making a forecast. Research in psychology shows that we \ncommonly fail to move forecasts toward the mean as much as we should.14     \n \nBaseball is a sport that lends itself to statistics by nature. Many of the interactions are discrete, which means \nthat you can measure them accurately over time. As a result, you can get a sense of which statistics reflect \nskill and which reflect luck. Here\u2019s a case of how you might use a calculation of r to make a forecast.    \n \nExhibit 4 shows two hitting statistics, \u201cin-play doubles and triples rate\u201d and \u201cstrikeout rate,\u201d for the 2011 and \n2012 seasons. In-play doubles (2B) and triples (3B) rate measures the percentage of balls put into play that \nresult in a double or triple. On average, that happens a little more than seven percent of the time. The \ncorrelation coefficient is just 0.14, which tells you that no matter what a player\u2019s rate is in a given year, you \nshould expect his rate in the following year to be close to the mean of all players. This doesn\u2019t mean that any \nindividual player\u2019s rate will revert to the mean, but rather that something close to the mean is a guess that will \ngenerate the smallest error for the population at large.   \n \nStrikeout rate is simply how frequently a batter strikes out, which averages a little less than one in every five \nplate appearances. The r is high at 0.82, which means a player\u2019s strikeout rate in one year is a solid predictor \nof his strikeout rate in the subsequent year. Contrast the fitted regression lines for each statistic. The line for \nin-play doubles and triples rate looks nearly flat, similar to a zero correlation line. The line for strikeout rate \nlooks close to a perfect correlation line. \n \nExhibit 4: Skill and Luck in Baseball Statistics \n \nSource: Baseball Prospectus.  \nNote: Minimum of 100 at-bats; In-play 2B and 3B rate = (2B + 3B) / (at-bats - strikeouts); Strikeout rate = strikeouts / plate appearances. \n \nWe are now ready to turn our attention to forecasting the rate of reversion to the mean for CFROI. Exhibit 5 \nstarts by showing reversion to the mean in CFROI for the consumer discretionary sector. The exhibit reflects \nthe results of 1,195 global companies for the years 2002-2012. The left panel starts by sorting the \ncompanies into quintiles by CFROI rank in 2002 and follows the cohorts through time.

Here, we create the quintiles based on 2012 CFROIs, and \ngo back to 2002. Just as with the heights of fathers and sons, we see that reversion to the mean in corporate \nperformance works forward or backward in time. This shows that competition cannot be the sole explanation \nfor reversion to the mean.  \n \nNow that we have established that reversion to the mean happens, we can turn our attention to estimating the \nrate at which it happens. To do so we calculate the correlation coefficient for each sector and insert it into the \nequation to estimate the expected outcome. Intuitively, you would expect that a sector with stable demand, \nsuch as consumer staples, would have a higher r than an industry exposed to commodity markets, such as \nenergy.  \n \nExhibit 6 shows that this relationship is indeed what we see empirically. The top charts examine the CFROI in \nthe consumer staples sector. The left panel shows that the correlation coefficient, r, is 0.88 between 2011 \nand 2012. The right panel shows that the r for the four-year change, from 2008 to 2012, is 0.73. The \nbottom charts consider the same relationships for the energy sector. The one-year r for energy is 0.68 and \nthe r for the four-year change is 0.39.

Take consumer staples as an illustration. Say a company \nhas a CFROI that is 10 percentage points above average. Using the one-year r, you\u2019d forecast the excess \nCFROI spread in 4 years to be 6.0 (0.884 * 10 = 6.0). But using the four-year r, you\u2019d forecast the spread to \nbe 7.3 (0.73 * 10 = 7.3). So using a one-year correlation coefficient overstates the rate of reversion to the \nmean. \n \nExhibit 7 shows the average correlation coefficient for the four-year change in CFROI for ten sectors from \n1986-2012, as well as the standard deviation for each series. There are two aspects of the exhibit worth \nemphasizing. The first is the ranking of r from the highest to the lowest. This provides a sense of the rate of \nreversion to the mean by sector. Consumer-oriented sectors are generally at the top of the list, and those \nsectors that have exposure to commodities tend to be at the bottom.  \n \nAlso important is how the r\u2019s change from year to year. While the ranking is reasonably consistent through \ntime, there is a large range in the standard deviation of r for each sector. For example, the r for the consumer \nstaples sector averaged 0.70 from 1990-2012 and had a standard deviation of just 0.036.

AutoZone\u2019s CFROI was 20.8 percent in the most recent fiscal year, the mean \nCFROI for the consumer discretionary sector was 8.7 percent from 1990-2012, and the four-year r for the \nsector is 0.56. Based on the formula, AutoZone\u2019s projected CFROI in four years is 15.5 percent, calculated \nas follows: \n \n           15.5  \n      =  0.56(20.8 \u2013 8.7) + 8.7 \n \nAfter five years, we can assume that about one-half of AutoZone\u2019s excess CFROI will be gone, either as a \nresult of internal or external factors.  \n \nIt is important to underscore that this is not a specific prediction about AutoZone. More accurately, it is a \ncharacterization of what happens on average to a large sample of companies in the same sector that start with \nsimilar excess CFROIs. Exhibit 9 shows this graphically. The dot on the left is the median less sector average \nCFROI for companies in the highest quintile of the consumer discretionary sector in 2002. The dot on the \nright shows the median less sector average CFROI for that same group in 2012.   \n \nThe exhibit demonstrates two points. The first is that the median excess CFROI reverts toward the mean for \nthe sector, as you would expect. The second is that the dot on the right summarizes a distribution of CFROIs. \nSome of the companies with high CFROIs in 2002 have even higher CFROIs in 2012, while others sink to \nlevels below the sector average. A simple picture of reversion to the mean belies the texture of the data.   \n \nExhibit 9: Reversion to the Mean Happens on Average \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \n \nModeling corporate performance is not simply a matter of plugging in assumptions about reversion to the \nmean. You may have well-founded reasons to believe that a particular company\u2019s results will be better or \nworse than what a simple model of reversion to the mean suggests, and you should reflect those results in \nyour model. That said, reversion to the mean should always be a consideration in your modeling because it is \nrelevant for a population of companies. \n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\nCFROI - Sector Average (%)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n>25\n(10)-(5)\n<(10)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFrequency\n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 17, 2013  \nHow to Model Reversion to the Mean \n12 \n \nEstimating the Mean to Which Results Revert  \n \nThe second issue we must address is the mean, or average, to which results revert. For some measures, such \nas sports statistics and the heights of parents and children, the means remain relatively stable over time. But \nfor other measures, including corporate performance, the mean can change from one period to the next. \n \nIn assessing the stability of the mean, you want to answer two questions. The first is: How stable has the \nmean been in the past? In cases where the average has been consistent over time and the environment isn\u2019t \nexpected to change much, you can safely use past averages to anticipate future averages. \n \nThe gray lines in the middle of each chart of Exhibit 10 are the mean (solid) and median (dashed) CFROI for \neach year for the consumer staples and energy sectors. The consumer staples sector had an average CFROI \nof 9.2 percent from 1990-2012, with a standard deviation of 0.5 percent. The energy sector had an average \nCFROI of 5.1 percent, with a standard deviation of 1.5 percent over the same period. So the CFROI in the \nenergy sector was lower than that for consumer staples and moved around a lot more.  \n \nIt comes as no surprise that the CFROI for energy is lower and more volatile than that for consumer staples. \nThis helps explain why reversion to the mean in energy is more rapid than that for consumer staples. You can \nassociate high volatility and low CFROIs with low valuation multiples, and low volatility and high CFROIs with \nhigh valuation multiples. This is what we see empirically for these sectors. \n \nAlso in Exhibit 10 are blue dashed lines that capture the CFROI for the 75th and 25th percentile companies \nwithin the sector. If you ranked 100 companies in a sector from 100 (the highest) to 1 (the lowest) based on \nCFROI, the 75th percentile would be the CFROI of company number 75. So plotting the percentiles allows you \nto see the dispersion in CFROIs for the sector. Appendix C shows the same chart for all ten sectors.  \nAnother way to show dispersion is the coefficient of variation, which is the standard deviation of the CFROIs \ndivided by the mean of the CFROIs. The coefficient of variation for 1990-2012 was 0.76 for consumer \nstaples and 1.25 for energy. For every 100 basis points of CFROI, there\u2019s much more variance in energy than \nin consumer staples.  \n \nExhibit 10: Mean and Median CFROI and 75th and 25th Percentiles \u2013 Consumer Staples and Energy  \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \n \n-6\n-2\n2\n6\n10\n14\n18\n1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012\nCFROI (%)\nConsumer Staples\n75th percentile\nMean\nMedian\n25th percentile\n-6\n-2\n2\n6\n10\n14\n18\n1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012\nCFROI (%)\nEnergy\n75th percentile\nMean\nMedian\n25th percentile\n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 17, 2013  \nHow to Model Reversion to the Mean \n13 \n \nThe second question is: What are the factors that affect the mean CFROI? For example, the CFROI for the \nenergy sector might be correlated to swings in oil prices, or returns for the financial sector might be dictated \nby changes in regulations. Analysts must answer this question sector by sector. \n \nAs reversion to the mean is a concept that applies wherever correlations are less than perfect, thinking about \nthis second question can frame debates. Currently, for instance, there\u2019s a contested debate about whether \noperating profit margins in the U.S. are sustainable.16 The answer lies in what factors drive the level of profit \nmargins\u2014including labor costs, depreciation expense, financing costs, and tax rates\u2014and what is happening \nto each. There will obviously be reversion to the mean for the operating profit margins of companies within a \nsector or industry. The question is whether aggregate profit margins will decline in coming years following a \nstrong rise since the depths of the recession.   \n \nSummary \n \nWe\u2019re now ready to wrap up the discussion. Exhibit 11 presents guidelines on the rate of reversion to the \nmean, as well as the proper mean to use, for ten sectors based on more than twenty years of data. \n \nExhibit 11: Rate of Reversion and to What Mean CFROIs Revert for Ten Sectors \n \nSource: Credit Suisse HOLT. \nNote: Coefficient of variation = average standard deviation / average CFROI. \n \nHere are the practical recommendations: \n \uf402\n Rate of reversion to the mean. The second column shows the average correlation coefficient, r, based \non four-year changes in CFROI for each sector from 1986-2012. As Exhibit 7 shows, these correlations \ntend to be reasonably stable and hence are a useful approximation for the rate of reversion to the mean \nover a multi-year period. You can plug these r\u2019s into the formula to forecast expected outcomes. \nRemember that reversion to the mean works on a population, not necessarily on every individual company. \n \uf402\n The mean to which CFROIs revert. This aspect of the forecast is more difficult than the rate of \nreversion to the mean because the mean CFROI rarely stays stable. The third and fourth columns of the \nexhibit show the average annual medians and means from 1990-2012, and the fifth column shows the \nstandard deviation of the annual means. We show medians as well as means because the CFROIs in \nmany of these sectors do not match a normal distribution. Still, you can use the means and medians \ninterchangeably in most cases as they tend to be close to one another.  \n \nHow Much Reversion?

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 17, 2013  \nHow to Model Reversion to the Mean \n14 \n \nIn some sectors, including consumer staples and consumer discretionary, the mean CFROIs are stable. \nOthers, including information technology and telecommunication services, have a great deal of volatility. \nFor sectors with CFROIs that have a low standard deviation, it is reasonable to assume that the historical \nmean is the number to which CFROIs revert. For sectors that are volatile, you should assess where the \nsector is in its cycle and aim to shade the historical average up or down to reflect mid-cycle profitability. \nNote that even mid-cycle profitability changes if the structure of the sector improves or deteriorates. \n \uf402\n This dispersion of CFROIs. The column on the right shows the coefficient of variation (average annual \nstandard deviation / average annual mean) for each sector based on data from 1990-2012. This is a \nmeasure of how much variance there is in the distribution of returns for the sector. The CFROIs for \ncompanies within a sector with a low coefficient of variance, such as utilities, tend to be very similar. \nSectors, including healthcare, have a high coefficient of variance, which means that some companies earn \nCFROIs much higher than others relative to the sector average. \n \nReversion to the mean is a tricky concept that many investors fail to fully comprehend. This report defined \nreversion to the mean, showed some of the common mistakes associated with it, and developed a general \nmodel for forecasting both the rate of reversion to the mean and the mean to which results revert. While the \nprimary focus here was on forecasting CFROI, you can apply the framework to consider any activity where \nreversion to the mean applies. \n \nThe report\u2019s specific guidelines are based on more than 20 years of global data for ten sectors. It comes as \nno surprise that some sectors are much easier to model than others. But even for those sectors that are more \nchallenging, these figures should provide a basis for healthy debate and deliberation. \n \n"

The first step is the explicit fade period, \nwhere the model fades the CFROI for a company over the next five years based on its position in the \ncorporate life cycle. The second step is the residual period, where the model eliminates ten percent of the \neconomic spread per year. The economic spread is the difference between the CFROI and the long-term \naverage. For instance, if a firm\u2019s economic spread is 10 percentage points at the end of the fifth forecast year \n(say, CFROI of 16 percent less an average of 6 percent), the economic spread would be 9 percentage points \nin the subsequent year.

With CFROI, HOLT aims to cut through \nthe vagaries of traditional accounting results and to provide a consistent metric that allows for comparison of \nperformance over time and across a portfolio, a market, or a global universe of companies. HOLT calculates \nCFROI for a company using two steps. First, it measures the inflation-adjusted gross cash flows available to all \ncapital owners and compares that to the inflation-adjusted gross investment made by the capital owners. \nSecond, it translates this ratio into an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) by recognizing the finite economic life of \ndepreciating assets and the residual value of non-depreciating assets.  \n \nWhile CFROI applies to industrial and service firms, Cash Flow Return on Equity (CFROE\u00ae) applies to financial \ncompanies.

Backtested, hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Simulated results are achieved \nby the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. The backtesting of performance differs from the actual \naccount performance because the investment strategy may be adjusted at any time, for any reason and can continue to be changed until desired or \nbetter performance results are achieved. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be \nmore appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results are neither an indicator nor a guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary from the analysis. \nInvestment principal on securities can be eroded depending on sale price or market price. In addition, there are securities on which investment principal \nmay be eroded due to changes in redemption amounts. Care is required when investing in such instruments. \n \nHOLT Disclaimer    \nThe HOLT methodology does not assign ratings or a target price to a security. It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary quantitative \nalgorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all the companies included in \nits database. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default variables and incorporated \ninto the algorithms available in the HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and earnings data provided by outside data vendors \nare subject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying economics of firm performance. These adjustments \nprovide consistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies across industries or national borders. The default \nscenario that is produced by the HOLT valuation model establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the \nwarranted price may also change. The default variables may also be adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur. \nAdditional information about the HOLT methodology is available on request \nCFROI, CFROE, HOLT, HOLT Lens, HOLTfolio, HOLTSelect, HS60, HS40, ValueSearch, AggreGator, Signal Flag, Forecaster, \u201cClarity is \nConfidence\u201d and \u201cPowered by HOLT\u201d are trademarks or registered trademarks of Credit Suisse Group AG or its affiliates in the United States and other \ncountries. \nHOLT is a corporate performance and valuation advisory service of Credit Suisse. \n\u00a9 2013 Credit Suisse Group AG and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
