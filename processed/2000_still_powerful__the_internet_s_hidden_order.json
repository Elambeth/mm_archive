      "text": "Still Powerful\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nExecutive Summary\nDespite the Internet\u2019s apparent complexity, hidden order exists. Studies\ndemonstrate that Web pages are distributed among sites according to a universal\npower law. Power laws are distribution functions for measurable quantities\u2014such\nas the number of earthquakes that occur at a particular intensity, or the number of\ncities that exist within a given range of population. The number of Web pages\nadheres to a remarkably stable regularity. Roughly described, power laws hold\nthat many sites have few pages and that few sites have many pages.\n1\nThe distribution of Web pages is not the only online phenomenon that adheres to\na power law. The distribution of visitors per site follows a power law as well: many\nsites have very few users, and a few sites have very many users. Although\nintuitive, the precise nature of these two regularities carries profound implications.\nOnline firms that depend on the ability to attract and monetize users face\nsignificant challenges. The observed power laws suggest a low probability that\nnewly established sites will attract a significant number of users.\n2 In fact, from\nJanuary 1999 to April 2000, 20 of the top 25 companies in the MediaMetrix \u201cTop\nProperties\u201d remained in the top 25.\n3\nWe first explored power laws and the Internet in late 1999.\n4 Despite a sharp\ncorrection in Internet stock prices over the last six months, the relationship\nbetween rank and the market value of online firms is still best expressed with a\npower law. This winner-take-all distribution continues to support the notion that\ncompetition on the Web has unique characteristics. Not only can large firms grow\nas quickly as small firms, but the positive-reinforcing nature of the medium also\ntranslates into a source of sustainable competitive advantage. This report\nexplores some of the factors that may contribute to the observed distribution.\n"

To show the\nbreakdown of Web site popularity, we ranked the number of unique site users on\nthe horizontal axis and plotted page views on the vertical axis, using MediaMetrix\ndata for the top 500 domains in April 2000. The result is a straight line when using\na double logarithmic scale. The data show that the top 5%, or 25 sites, account\nfor 31% of the total volume of traffic.\n5 This is consistent with broader studies of\nthe Web showing that the top sites account for a very large percentage of total\ntraffic volume. That is, one-tenth of one percent of the total, or the top 119 sites,\naccount for 32% of the total volume of site traffic.\n6 Very few Web sites get large,\nand very few Web sites get a lot of user traffic.\nFigure 1\nPower Laws\nT op 500, April 2000\n10 0\n10 1\n10 2\n10 2\n10 3\n10 4\n10 5\nRank\nHits (000)\nSource: MediaMetrix and CSFB analysis.\nA logarithmic plot of rank versus frequency that is a straight line with slope near\nunity (as seen in Figure 1) illustrates Zipf\u2019s law. This regularity has been observed\nin diverse realms, including the magnitude and frequency of earthquakes, rank\nand city sizes, and the distribution of words in a language. Extremities are\napparent when Zipf distributions are plotted on a linear scale. A few elements\nscore very high, a medium number of elements score in the middle of the road,\nand an enormous number of elements score very low. (The long tail of the\ndistribution hugs the x-axis.)\nPower laws are unusual\u2014they represent special situations. Gaussian, or normal,\ndistributions are much more common in nature than power law distributions. For\nexample, the velocity of gas molecules in a room, the length of new-born babies,\nand the distribution of market capitalizations for the broader stock market all\nfollow Gaussian distributions. One common trait of Gaussian systems is\nindependence. To use gas molecules as an illustration, the velocity of any given\nmolecule will not explicitly depend on the velocity of the other molecules. Even\nwhen the molecules collide, there is only a small degree of interaction.\nIn contrast, power laws occur when there is a high degree of interaction. The\ncanonical example is a forest fire. The probability that a given tree in the forest\n"

The underlying \u201cnetwork\u201d position\nof the trees determines whether or not the blaze dies out, is confined to a small\narea, or becomes a conflagration. This complexity gives rise to power law\ndistributions in the sizes of forest fires. The concentration of hits on a Web site\nalso translates into a concentration of market value, so the most frequently used\nsites generally have the best opportunity to create viable business models. It\u2019s\ninteresting that the valuation of Internet companies still conforms to a power law,\ndespite a pronounced downturn in the segment over the last six months. This can\nbe seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 2\nInternet Market Capitalization Power Law\n Internet\n10 0\n10 1\n10 2\n10 0\n10 1\n10 2\n10 3\n10 4\n10 5\n10 6\nRank\nMarket Value (000,000)\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nThis analysis provides compelling evidence that the market continues to value\nInternet companies correctly on a relative basis. It is important to note that these\ndata remain mute on the issue of absolute valuations. Contrary to popular\nperception, there is some discernible order to Internet valuations. So the question\nbecomes, Is this order unique to Internet stocks? Do other industries exhibit the\nsame characteristics, where a disproportionate share of the total market\ncapitalization resides in a handful of firms? We analyzed 46 sectors from 18\ndifferent industry classifications in an attempt to answer this question. This broad\nsurvey revealed that 9 sectors exhibited strong power law characteristics. They\nare displayed in the Appendix.\n"

      "text": "Still Powerful\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nThe Strong Get Stronger\nWhile no pure Internet brand is reinforced by the benefit of a physical presence,\nmany particular characteristics of the online medium allow those companies that\nare already ahead to stay ahead. One example noted in \u201cAbsolute Power\u201d is that\nnew sites tend to link to already-popular sites in a bid for increased traffic. Such a\nreinforcing link structure is reconfirmed in a number of subsequent studies of the\nWeb.\nThe most comprehensive study of the Web to date reveals some interesting\ninsights into its macroscopic structure. Researchers at IBM\u2019s Almaden Research\nCenter in San Jose, California, examined over 200 million pages and 1.5 billion\nlinks (roughly one-fifth of the estimated current Web). They found that the Web\u2019s\nconnectivity resembles a bow tie. On the left side of the tie is what they dub the\n\u201cnewbies.\u201d This group of sites consists of 43 million pages (or 21% of the total)\nthat are relatively new. These sites link to the center, or what is called the\n\u201cStrongly Connected Component\u201d (SCC). However, these established players in\nthe center\u2014with over 56 million pages\u2014do not link back to the newbies. Sites in\nthe SCC consist of portals and many of the top corporate sites in the MediaMetrix\ndata. On the right side of the bow are the \u201cintroverts.\u201d This group includes a lot of\nlesser-known e-commerce sites. Although the SCC is linked to these introverts,\nthe introverts do not provide links back to the strongly connected center.\n7\nMost search engines rely on so-called \u201ccrawlers.\u201d Crawlers work by indexing a\nWeb page, jumping to other pages linked to it, then indexing those, and so on.\nThe Almaden study contradicts earlier suggestions that any two Web pages are\nconnected by a relatively small number of hyperlinks. In order to give wide\nbreadth of coverage in the future, search engines will have to crawl from a\ngreater diversity of starting points than they do today.\n8 Until this occurs, they will\ncontinue to channel traffic to the most popular and entrenched Web sites\u2014\nwithout any reciprocity for the newbies. With only a fraction of the growing Web\nappearing in most search queries, traffic patterns to the existing strongly\nconnected sites are positively reinforced.\nAdvertising Spiral\nSo how does this translate into economic value? One example of the value\nconcentration is advertising. Advertisers aren\u2019t taking any chances with the \u201cnew\u201d\nmedium: about 95% of Web advertising is spent on 1% of all ad-supported Web\nsites. And while the absolute number of Web sites receiving online ad revenues\ncontinues to grow, the percentage share of ad dollars being spent at the top 50\nsites continues to rise.\nTable 1\nPublishers\u2019 Share of Total Web Ad Revenues\n1998\n1999\n2000\nTop 10 Sites\n72%\n74%\n76%\nTop 25 Sites\n85%\n87%\n89%\nTop 50 Sites\n92%\n95%\n95%\nSource: eMarketer estimates.\nAlthough this profile may change as advertisers shift their dollars away from\nportals and toward more highly targeted vertical Web sites, advertisers continue\nto gravitate toward high-traffic sites.\n"

As the competition between Web sites heats up, a\nprofound shift can take place from an environment where many sites\nsimultaneously thrive to a winner-take-most market where a handful of sites\nattract most users. This is attributable to a nonlinear interaction among sites,\nwhich effectively reduces the growth rate of some, owing to extreme competitive\npressure from others.\n9\nWith firms spending enormous sums to sustain growth, it is easy to see that it is\npossible to reach a critical spending point where funding dries up (in tandem with\nthe business fundamentals). This phenomenon can occur even with only two\ncompeting sites, and is comparable to the \u201cprinciple of mutual exclusion\u201d in\necology. Two predators of the same prey cannot coexist in equilibrium when\ncompetitive predation is very strong.\n10\nOnce the fixed development cost of operating a Web site is spent, it is relatively\ninexpensive to scale capacity to meet increased demand. So as Web sites\nproliferate, focus on aggregate demand becomes the order of the day.\nUnfortunately, many Web company \u201cpredators\u201d are competing for the attention\nand resources of the same consumer \u201cprey.\u201d\n"

In the fourth quarter of 1999 alone, $14.9 billion was spent on new\nbusiness opportunities. This quarterly total was higher than any annual amount in\nthe history of U.S. venture capital. Picking up where 1999 left off, venture-backed\nfirms raised $17.8 billion in the first quarter of the new millennium. About 84%\nwent to Internet-related ventures.
