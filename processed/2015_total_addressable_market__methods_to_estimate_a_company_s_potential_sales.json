      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n4 \nIntroduction \n \nThe ability to calibrate the total addressable market (TAM) is a major part of anticipating value creation. Since \n1960, about one-third of the value of the S&P 500 Index has been attributable to the anticipated payoff from \nfuture investment. Assessing value creation requires understanding how much a company can invest and the \nreturns those investments will earn.1   \n \nWe define TAM as the revenue a company would realize if it had 100 percent share of a market it could serve \nwhile creating shareholder value. TAM is a concept that executives and investors use frequently, but that few \ndefine properly or thoughtfully. You should recognize up front that TAM is not about how large a firm can grow \nto be but rather how much it can expand while adding value. \n \nAn exchange in 2014 between Aswath Damodaran and Bill Gurley over the prospects for Uber, the \ntransportation company, brings TAM into sharp focus. Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School \nof Business at New York University and a recognized expert in valuation, suggested the company was worth \nabout $6 billion, a fraction of the $17 billion value implied by a round of financing the company had completed \nat that time.2 (A round in the summer of 2015 valued the business in excess of $50 billion.3) \n \nGurley, a highly successful venture capitalist with Benchmark Capital and an early investor in Uber, responded \nwith an article called \u201cHow to Miss By a Mile: An Alternative Look at Uber\u2019s Potential Market Size,\u201d in which \nhe argued that Damodaran\u2019s valuation grossly underestimated the magnitude of Uber\u2019s potential TAM.4 Both \nmen are believers in using discounted cash flow to value the business so the crux of their disagreement, which \nwas refreshingly civil, sat squarely on the perceived size of Uber\u2019s opportunities.       \n \nDamodaran calculates Uber\u2019s TAM based on the taxi and car service business, which he estimates to be \n$100 billion. He then assumes the company can reach a market share of 10 percent, and proceeds to \ncalculate the value of the business. Gurley suggests that Uber\u2019s TAM is in the range of $450 billion to $1.3 \ntrillion, and argues the company can capture a market share of up to 25 percent. Gurley comes to a wildly \ndifferent conclusion about value because the high end of his estimate for addressable TAM is more than 25 \ntimes larger than what Damodaran assumes. To buttress his case, Gurley notes that Uber\u2019s revenue in San \nFrancisco, one of its early markets, is already \u201cmultiples bigger\u201d than the $140 million of total revenue from \nthe taxi and car service industry. And business is still growing rapidly in that region.     \n \nAfter a brief discussion of product categorization, this report provides a framework for estimating TAM through \nthe process of triangulation. We use three methods. The first approach is based on population, product, and \nconversion. Next, we examine a diffusion model, which not only addresses the absolute size of the market but \nalso the rate of adoption. The key is to come up with sensible parameters to inform the model. Finally, we \ndiscuss the usefulness of appealing to base rates as a reality check for optimistic TAM estimates and growth \nrates. \n \nIn the last section of the report we discuss TAM in the context of business category evolution. Increasingly, \ncompanies seek to build ecosystems around their goods or services that can expand their addressable market. \nThis is relevant in understanding the popular topic of the \u201cinternet of things,\u201d where people or objects are \nnodes of an interactive network and information is freely transferred between the nodes. \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n5 \nCategorizing New Products \n \nThe categorization of products is a logical starting point in assessing market size.5 There are several \ncategories of products, but we can arrange them based on whether the product technology and customers are \nnew or current (see Exhibit 1). This allows us to appraise a company\u2019s strategy to promote the product and \nprovides guidance about which forecasting method is likely to be most effective.  \n \nFor current technologies with current customers, captured in the bottom left corner of exhibit 1, the basic \nanalysis boils down to how much the market will grow and how market shares will change. These are not new \nproducts, so a TAM analysis is of limited use. Companies can influence their TAM through pricing strategy and \nproduct enhancement.  \n \nExhibit 1: Classification of New Products \n \nSource: Kenneth B. Kahn, New Product Forecasting: An Applied Approach (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2006), 9. \n \nOn April 2, 1993, Philip Morris cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 20 percent in an effort to prop up its \nmarket share. This is an example of a pricing strategy. The stock market didn\u2019t like the decision to trade \nhigher market share for lower profits, and the shares of Philip Morris stock lost almost a quarter of their value. \nProduct enhancement can reflect improvement in the product itself or in elements of design or packaging. \nThink of the evolution of packaging for Heinz ketchup.  \n \nThere is a positive correlation between market share and profitability, which encourages some executives to \nfocus on market share goals. However, evidence from academic research shows that corporate objectives \nfocused on competitors, including targets for market share, are generally harmful to profitability.6   \n \nCurrent technologies that have applications for new customers (upper left corner of exhibit 1) and new \ntechnologies used by current customers (bottom right corner) are the categories where a TAM analysis is most \nrelevant. Current technologies for new customers include geographic extension and novel applications of \nexisting products. The classic example of the latter is the use of Arm & Hammer baking soda as a means to \nmanage odor in a refrigerator. Pharmaceutical products with therapeutic applications beyond their initial target \nare another case in point.  \nForecast \nMethod\nProduct \nStrategy\nNew \nCustomers \nCurrent \nCustomers\nMarket \nDevelopment\nCustomer and \nMarket Analysis\nDiversification / \nDisruptive\nScenario Analysis \n(What If)\nMarket \nPenetration\nSales Analysis\nProduct \nDevelopment\nProduct Line / Life \nCycle Analysis\nProduct \nStrategy\nForecast \nMethod\nNew \nTechnology\nCurrent \nTechnology\n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n6 \nNew technologies for current customers fall in a range from the prosaic, such as line extensions, to disruptive \ninnovations. An instance of a line extension is the launch of Colgate Total toothpaste, which included novel \nantibacterial technology, in 1997. That product quickly gained one-tenth of the U.S. toothpaste market.  \n \nThe theory of disruptive innovation was formalized by Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business \nSchool. Part of the theory describes the process by which products enter a market using a new \u201cvalue \nnetwork,\u201d essentially a different business model. The introduction of electronic books and the interplay \nbetween Amazon.com\u2019s e-book inventory and the Kindle, its reading device, is an example of an innovation \nthat disrupted the book industry. \n \nEstimating TAM is trickiest when both the technology and the customers are new. Here, the number of \nultimate adopters, as well as the rate of adoption, is unknown. This is where forecasters have made some of \nthe most embarrassing blunders of all time. The market for computers? Maybe five, said the head of IBM in \nthe early 1940s. How about personal computers? \u201cThere is no reason anyone would want a computer in their \nhome,\u201d said the founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, a maker of minicomputers.7 \n \nThe value in categorizing new products is to get a sense of the best way to forecast the TAM. In some cases \nthe process is as straightforward as counting potential users and estimating market share and pricing. In other \ncases, especially in those dealing with novel goods or services where network effects are relevant, the range \nof outcomes is much wider and less certain. Let\u2019s take a look at some specific ways to estimate TAM.     \n \nMarket Size: Population, Product, and Conversion \n \nThe first approach to assess TAM is to estimate the absolute size of the market, which is simply the number of \npotential customers times the expected revenue per customer. This model is popular for estimating the sales \npotential for a new drug.8 Exhibit 2 shows the components of the TAM estimate. There are three parts to this \nanalysis: estimates of the broad population, the population likely to use the good or service, and the revenue \npotential. Here\u2019s an examination using statins, cholesterol-reducing drugs, as a case study. \n \uf402\n \nPopulation. The analysis begins with the population of individuals who may have a particular disease. \nThose patients must consult with a health care provider, be properly diagnosed, and seek treatment. \nMore than 20 percent of the 320 million people in the United States have high cholesterol. A joint study \nby the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association suggests that 56 million \nAmericans between the ages of 40 and 75, roughly three-quarters of those with high cholesterol, are \neligible to consider a statin. About 25 million Americans are currently taking statins.9  \n \uf402\n \nProduct. There are about a half-dozen prescription statins available in the U.S. They vary in efficacy. \nFactors that determine market share include the characteristics of the drug itself, marketing, pricing, and \npatent protection. For other pharmaceutical products, additional factors in determining the rate and \nlikelihood of adoption include method of delivery, frequency of use, and dosage. \n \uf402\n \nConversion. Just because a patient is prescribed a drug doesn\u2019t mean that he or she will take it as \nsuggested. Compliance is a large issue. For example, studies suggest that about half of the patients who \nreceive a prescription for a drug to lower lipids stop taking it within six months. Only 40 percent still take \nthe drug after a year, and roughly one-quarter after five years.10 The main reasons patients are non-\ncompliant is that they don\u2019t know they are supposed to refill their prescription and they don\u2019t like the side \neffects. After you come up with a forecast for volume, you can consider the price for the product. This \nultimately allows for an estimate of the sales for the product.   \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n7 \nExhibit 2: Components of Total Addressable Market Forecast \n \nSource: Based on Arthur G. Cook, Forecasting for the Pharmaceutical Industry: Models for New Product and In-Market Forecasting and How to Use \nThem (Burlington, VT: Gower Publishing Company, 2006), 36.  \n \nResearchers at McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, studied the sales forecasts for new drugs made by \nanalysts at brokerage firms.11 The data included more than 1,700 individual forecasts on 260 drugs over a \nrecent ten-year span. The researchers found that the median error of all analysts for a drug\u2019s peak sales was \nonly four percent. But the average error was large. Almost two-thirds of the estimates missed the peak \nrevenue amount by 40 percent or more. Further, forecasts for follow-on drugs were no better than the first \nlaunches within a therapeutic class. \n \nA more in-depth analysis of the absolute size of the market requires careful consideration of factors that shape \ndemand and supply. We\u2019ll start with demand.  \n \nFrom the outset, it is useful to distinguish between the user and the payer. They may not be the same. For \nexample, parents buy goods and services for their young children, and pet owners purchase on behalf of their \npets.12 This point is especially relevant in health care, where the consumers and payers are separate. In these \ncases, you need to consider the needs of the user as well as the incentives of the payer. \n \nOther factors to consider in assessing demand include: \n \uf402\n \nFinancial resources. How much money do the buyers have? Are their resources growing or shrinking? \n \uf402\n \nPhysical limitations. This includes a consideration of how much a person can eat, drink, wear, or use a \nproduct. A market becomes saturated when most people are using as much of the product as they can. \nFor instance, shifts in how consumers allocate their time are having a profound effect on the media and \nadvertising industries, and the dust has yet to settle. \n \nPopulation\nEpidemiology\nGrowth rate\nDiagnosed\nSymptomatic\nPotential \npatients\nAccess\nDrug-treated\nPatients on \ndrug\nShare\nCompetition\nCannibalization\nAdoption\nPatients on \nProduct X\nSales \nforecast\nReimbursement\nPrice\nVolume \nforecast\nCompliance\nDosing\nPersistence\nMarket\nProduct\nConversion\n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n8 \uf402\n \nElasticity of demand. Elasticity measures the change in demand as a function of a change in price. \nInelastic goods show little decrease in demand as prices increase, whereas demand drops more rapidly \nfor elastic goods. So as prices rise, TAM may grow for an inelastic good and shrink for an elastic good.   \n \uf402\n \nCyclicality. Some products have cyclical demand, which cautions against extrapolating short periods of \nresults into estimates of TAM.   \n \uf402\n \nSubstitution and substitution threats. Substitution is a big deal in assessing TAM. How does a \nconsumer allocate his or her time and money today and how might that change over time? This factor \nappears at the center of the disagreement between Damodaran and Gurley on Uber: Damodaran \nconsiders only that Uber will be a substitute for taxis and limos, whereas Gurley assumes that it will be a \nsubstitute for the ways we move people and things from point A to point B.   \n \nValue creation is at the center of a careful definition of TAM. The question is not how big the company can get, \nbut rather the revenue potential assuming the company can generate a return on investment excess of the \ncost of capital.13 This is relevant as we consider TAM from the supply side.  \n \nSimilar to the case with users and buyers, we must recognize that suppliers may be different than sellers. For \nexample, most automakers use a network of dealers to sell their cars. So, the TAM for the automakers \nreflects, at least to some degree, the location and quality of their dealer network. \n \nOther factors to consider in assessing supply include: \n \uf402\n Ability to supply. Considerations include a business\u2019s production capacity, the infrastructure to get \ngoods to market, and its geographical footprint. A company\u2019s ability to supply a good or service is \ncommonly limited to a fraction of the market it can theoretically access.    \n \uf402\n Unit growth and pricing. You want to consider carefully where the industry is in its life cycle and what \nthat implies about the rate of growth and pricing flexibility. Assess how well capacity, whether based on \nmanufacturing, service, or knowledge production, matches the rate of demand growth. Ask whether the \ncompany uses pricing as a lever to drive scale or to increase profitability. As we will see, this is relevant \nfor businesses seeking to capture network effects.     \n \uf402\n Regulatory constraints. Regulations can play a large role in shaping TAM. Economic regulation creates \nrules that limit which companies can participate in an industry. These include capital requirements, tariffs \nand quotas, price or rate of return caps, and licenses. Social regulation attempts to address potential \nmarket failures. Emission standards and mandated information disclosure are examples. Changes in \nregulation can shrink or expand TAM.     \n \uf402\n Incentives. This discussion can start with the classic principal-agent problem, where management may \nmake choices that increase their utility at the expense of shareholders. For example, companies in the \nU.S. are investing in their businesses at a very measured rate. Shareholders may want to see the \ncompanies invest more aggressively, and some have said as much publicly.14 Ironically, the increase in \ncompensation in the form of restricted stock units, meant to make the interests of executives more \naligned with those of shareholders, may be encouraging risk aversion. Conflicts can also happen within \nthe business. For example, a traditional brick and mortar retailer may fear too much success with an \nonline offering as the customer migration may harm the economics of the physical stores.   \n \n"

But most companies \ncan only achieve scale advantages on a local basis. Few can do it nationally or internationally.15 Since \ncreating value is in the definition of TAM, addressable TAM is commonly smaller than total TAM because \nof the difficulty of gaining scale.  \n \uf402\n Niches. If two or more competitors are in the same market, they often concentrate on different \nsegments so as to reduce competitive conflict. As a consequence, the TAM is not as large as it appears. \n \nEstimating the absolute size of the market by considering population, product, and conversion is a solid \nfoundation for assessing TAM and will likely remain so. However, we can add richness to our analysis by \nconsidering a social dimension.   \n \nTAM and the Bass Model \n \nThe workhorse for forecasting the rate of adoption for new products and services is a model developed in the \n1960s by a marketing professor named Frank Bass.16 Bass was influenced by Everett Rogers, a professor of \ncommunications and sociology, who wrote the seminal book, Diffusion of Innovations.17 The Bass model \nallows for a prediction of the purchasers in a period, say for each year, as well as a total number of purchasers. \nSo the model helps calibrate TAM as well as the rate of growth in getting to TAM. This rate of growth is \nessential to valuing a business. \n \nA simple version of the Bass model relies on three parameters:18  \n \uf402\n The coefficient of innovation (p). This captures mass-market influence. The parameter p is at play if \nyou are excited about buying a good or service even though you don\u2019t know anyone who has it yet, or if \nadvertising has influenced you.   \n \uf402\n The coefficient of imitation (q). This reflects interpersonal influence. It\u2019s basically the power of word of \nmouth or social contagion. You want something because all of your friends have it. \n \uf402\n An estimate of the number of eventual adopters (m). A parameter that determines the size of the \nmarket.    \n \nThe key to a model\u2019s usefulness is coming up with thoughtful inputs for the parameters. We\u2019ll discuss how to \ndo that in a moment.  \n \nSay we want to determine the number of adopters (N) during a specific period. The equation for the Bass \nmodel is as follows: \n \nN(t) \u2013 N(t\u22121) = [p + qN(t\u22121)/m] x [m \u2013 N(t\u22121)]  \n \nThe equation looks intimidating, but we can break it into parts to make it a lot easier to grasp. It basically says \nthat new adopters equal the adoption rate times the number of potential new adopters.  \n \nN(t) \u2013 N(t\u22121), the number of adopters during a period, is simply the difference between the users now, N(t), \nand the users in the prior period, N(t\u22121). So if there were 110 users at the end of period t and 100 at t\u22121, \nthere would have been 10 adopters during the period (110 \u2013 100 = 10). \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n10 \nThe first term on the right side of the equation, [p + qN(t\u22121)/m], spells out the rate of adoption. People are \nmore likely to adopt a product or service if lots of other people are already using it. So the coefficient of \nimitation, q, is applied to the proportion of users, which is N(t\u22121)/m. Let\u2019s say the number of eventual users is \n500. That means that if N(t\u22121) equals 100 and m equals 500, then N(t\u22121)/m is 0.20 (100/500 = 0.20). \nYou multiply q by that penetration rate. The coefficient of innovation, p, is independent of the number of users.    \n \nThe second term on the right side is the number of users who have not yet adopted the product. It\u2019s the total \nnumber of eventual adopters, m, minus the number of adopters in period t\u22121. With an m of 500 and t\u22121 of \n100, we know the number of people who have yet to adopt the product is 400 (500 \u2013 100 = 400).   \n \nOne study of diffusion found that the average coefficient of innovation, p, was 0.037, significantly smaller than \nthe average coefficient of imitation, q, of 0.327. Appendix A shows the empirical parameters for more than 50 \nproducts.19 \n \nExhibit 3 shows the output of the model assuming an m of 100, and a range of values for p (from 0.003 to \n0.150) and q (from 0.000 to 0.700). In cases when q is larger than p, the penetration of users follows an S-\ncurve, as the left side of the exhibit shows. Thus, when the coefficient of imitation is greater than zero, the \nproportion of users that adopt follows a pattern similar to a normal distribution. You can see this on the right \nside of the exhibit. This is very consistent with the work of Everett Rogers.20 \n \nExhibit 3: Output from the Bass Model  \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.  \n \nInvestor application of the Bass model. Investors can use the model in a couple of ways. The first is to \nestimate product potential based on the parameters from historical diffusions. Bass\u2019s model of the adoption of \nsatellite television is an example of this approach.21  \n \nIn 1992, Bass forecasted the number of satellite television subscribers for 1999 based on market research, \npast diffusion patterns, and management guidance.

Ferguson, and Mary Lou Githens, \u201cDIRECTV: Forecasting Diffusion of a New Technology Prior to \nProduct Launch,\u201d Interfaces, Vol. 31, No. 3, May-June 2001, S90. \n \nA second way to use the model is to start with a company\u2019s stock price and work backward. This allows for an \nassessment of what the market anticipates for the rate of growth in adopters as well as the total number of \nadopters. You can then compare the parameters imputed from the market price with empirical results to judge \nthe likelihood of achieving those levels. This expectations approach trades the need for specificity for a general \nsense of plausibility.  \n \nThe Bass model has another nice feature: it allows you to solve for the size of peak sales.22 An estimate for \nthis outcome can be very relevant for gauging expectations. You can calculate the size of peak sales with this \nequation: \n \n \n \nThis measure is relevant because companies and investors are tempted to extrapolate the growth rates they \nsee in the steepest part of the S-curve, and hence anticipate too much growth. For instance, color televisions \nwere launched in the 1950s and reached peak sales in 1968 (color televisions didn\u2019t outsell black and white \nmodels until the early 1970s). As the industry was growing rapidly in the 1960s, manufacturers extrapolated \nthat growth and added capacity accordingly. The result was manufacturing capacity in 1968 of 14 million units, \nwhile sales topped out at 6 million.   \n \nResearchers have added a number of refinements to the Bass model in an effort to address the model\u2019s \nlimitations.23 But since its introduction 45 years ago, the basic model has been reasonably robust in explaining \nthe pattern of sales for products as varied as videocassette recorders, color television sets, and personal \ncomputers.24  \n \nThe goal of a diffusion model is to understand the shape of consumer adoption and hence the evolution of the \nindustry. Naturally, there can be many competitors in an industry jockeying for market share. A diffusion model \nshows TAM, which assumes that one company can garner all of the market. How the market is divided is also \ncrucial. \n \nDetailed studies of product and industry life cycles show that there are typically three stages in industry \nevolution.25 During the first stage, the number of competitors grows. For example, the number of firms grew \nfrom a handful to about 75 in the U.S. automobile industry in this stage. In the second stage there is a large \nshakeout as the result of a high number of firms exiting, which means that the number of competing firms \ndeclines sharply. In autos, the number dropped to about 20. Finally, the number of competitors, and often \nmarket shares, stabilize in the third stage.    \n \n1992 forecast of homes Actual number of homes 1992 forecast of\nActual yearly \nacquiring satellite TV\nacquiring satellite TV\npenetration (%)\npenetration (%)\n1995\n0.875\n1.150\n0.92\n1.21\n1996\n2.269\n3.076\n2.37\n3.21\n1997\n4.275\n5.076\n4.42\n5.25\n1998\n6.775\n7.358\n6.95\n7.55\n1999\n9.391\n9.989\n9.55\n10.16\nSize of peak sales = m[(p+q)2\n4q\n[\n"

Consider a new industry that has \nsales of $100 split equally among 10 competitors. Say that as the industry goes through stage two, sales rise \nto $200 while the number of firms drops to 5. As the industry\u2019s sales doubled, the potential amount of sales \nquadrupled for the survivors.  \n \nEstimating parameters for the Bass model. The output of any diffusion model is only as good as the \nparameters you use, so we now turn to an approach to estimating the parameters of the Bass model. The \nprimary way to do this is through analogy. For example, you might assume that the adoption of satellite \ntelevision is analogous to the adoption of cable television. \n \nOf course, finding proper analogies is tricky. Even if products are alike in some regards, they will be different \nin other ways. There should be no expectation that the diffusion process of one product will comport exactly \nwith another.  \n \nExhibit 5 summarizes various microeconomic factors that provide a solid basis for finding appropriate \nanalogies.26 The specific process is to select a handful of products that are candidates as good analogies, and \nscore them on the factors in the exhibit. The score allows you to assess which products or services are most \nakin to the one you are modeling and therefore provides a starting point for the appropriate parameters.

Academics and consultants have shown the model\u2019s value in forecasts and have established a solid \nfoundation of empirical parameters to guide judgments. But the model does have some limitations that don\u2019t \nallow it to capture certain considerations that are vital to anticipating corporate results.   \n \nWe will focus on three areas. The first is the importance of replacement cycles. This is especially relevant in \nforecasting revenue growth. Next we consider economies of scale. As we have emphasized all along, TAM is not \nabout size, it\u2019s about the size at which a company can create shareholder value. And finally there is the role of \nnetwork effects. Here, we see lopsided market share distributions and increasing returns for the winners.  \n \nReplacement cycle. The Bass model is used primarily to forecast adoption of a product. But once a \nconsumer buys something once, the next question is how frequently he or she will replace the product. Do \nyou get a new smartphone every time a new product is announced? Or are you content to hold on to last \nyear\u2019s model so long as it\u2019s working fine? \n \nFrank Bass discussed the repurchase rate in his early research, but the topic has drawn less attention than \nthe basics of the diffusion model itself.32 Appendix C has a detailed discussion of the role of replacement \ncycles in product demand. The main point is that unit demand can fall, even with a rise in population and \npenetration rate, if the replacement cycle lengthens. At a certain point of maturity, the replacement cycle \nbecomes an essential component of demand.

A company enjoys economies of scale when its cost per unit for key tasks, including \npurchasing, production, distribution, sales, and service, declines as volume increases.33 Economies of scale \ncan be a vital source of competitive advantage, and therefore value creation, but you must be mindful of its \nlimits. Getting bigger isn\u2019t always consistent with greater economies of scale. This means that companies \ncommonly fail to create value beyond a certain size, practically limiting the level of TAM. \n \nIn this context, Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School, \nstresses that \u201call strategy is local.\u201d34 By this he means that companies can enjoy economies of scale on a local \nor regional basis, but as the company grows, fulfilling its theoretical TAM, its ability to create incremental value \ndissipates rapidly. \n \nGreenwald uses the retail industry as an example, and Wal-Mart is his primary case study.35 The company \nestablished its strength in the 1970s through the mid-1980s by being superior to its competitors in inbound \nlogistics, advertising, and executive supervision. These advantages were largely the result of geographic \nconcentration. This allowed the company\u2019s stores and distribution centers to be tightly clustered, the \nadvertising dollars to have an impact on lots of stores, and the management to have the ability to effectively \noversee operations without having to span the country. The case study shows that when Wal-Mart expanded \nbeyond its local strengths, its return on capital and competitive advantage eroded.    \n \nGreenwald shows that there is a high correlation between local market share for retailers, reflecting \ngeographic concentration, and profitability. This lesson is relevant not only for retailers that rely on physical \nstores, but also for any business that relies on local distribution. If a company rolls trucks to serve its \ncustomers, geographic concentration is important.  \n \nA separate issue, although with similar implications, is when companies \u201covershoot\u201d their markets.36 This \nrelates to the theory of disruptive innovation that Clayton Christensen developed. One of the concepts of the \ntheory is that companies improve their product or service at a rate that is faster than what the market \ndemands. Eventually, customers get more than they need and are therefore unwilling to pay for additional \nproduct enhancements. Two symptoms of an overshot market are that customers use only a fraction of the \nfunctionality the product offers, and they are averse to paying for new features.  \n \nCompanies serving overshot markets are vulnerable in two ways. The first is companies that are investing to \nimprove performance, if even for competitive reasons, find that the customers are reticent to pay for such \nimprovements. This crimps profitability. Second, the market becomes open to what Christensen calls \n\u201cdisruptive innovations.\u201d These innovations are typically cheaper and simpler, and satiate the demands of only \nthe least discerning customers. But the performance of these innovations improves rapidly, allowing them to \nappeal to mainstream consumers quickly. Disruptive innovations rely on a different business model than the \nincumbents and almost always have a lower cost structure. \n \nAs a result, companies in overshot markets eventually get into a bind. They can\u2019t go upmarket to achieve \ngreater profitability because the customer won\u2019t pay more. At the same time, they can\u2019t go downmarket \nbecause they run into the disruptive innovators that have lower costs. These companies are stuck.  \n \nA proper consideration of TAM includes the potential size of the market as well as the constraints to creating \nvalue. To add value over the long run, a company must have a competitive advantage. Economies of scale are \none source of competitive advantage, but it is extremely difficult for companies with physical assets to achieve \nscale on a national or international basis. Further, companies can get to the point where they have overshot \nthe market, which precludes them from moving upmarket while creating value. \n \n"

Network effects exist when the value of a good or service increases as more people use \nthat good or service.37 The classic example is the telephone. If you are the only one with a phone, it is of no \nvalue. But as more people acquire one, the value of each phone rises. Metcalfe\u2019s law, which is more a \nguideline than a law, suggests the total value of a network, where n is the number of members, is proportional \nto n2 \u2013 n.   \n \nMost of the products in Appendix A do not benefit from network effects in a meaningful way. Whether your \nneighbor has a blender or air conditioning doesn\u2019t affect the value of those products for you. Even hub-and-\nspoke networks, such as airlines, have limited network effects. However, the rise of the Internet and mobile \ncommunications has made network effects more relevant in recent decades. The key is that these are \ncombinatorial networks, where the nodes can communicate with one another.38 \n \nConsider the back-and-forth between Aswath Damodaran and Bill Gurley on the value of Uber. You can best \ndescribe Uber as a platform company that derives its value from network effects. For example, more users \nattract more drivers, and more drivers create more coverage and lower prices for the users, which creates \nadditional demand, and so forth. Other classic examples of companies benefitting from network effects \ninclude Visa, eBay, Instagram, and Skype.   \n \nIn cases where network effects are strong, it is common for one network to become dominant. For most \nconsumer products, including athletic shoes, soft drinks, and automobiles, the market share of the leading \ncompany rarely tops 40 percent.39 But in businesses with strong network effects, market shares are generally \nwell above 50 percent and commonly closer to 90 percent. Examples include Microsoft\u2019s historical share of \npersonal computer operating systems, eBay\u2019s share of online auctions, and Google\u2019s share of Internet \nsearches.   \n \nW. Brian Arthur, an economist who has studied the networked economy extensively, likes to say, \u201cOf \nnetworks, there will be few.\u201d40 From a practical point of view, this means that companies will fight early on to \nbecome the network of choice, often spending great sums of money to do so.  \n \nCompanies allocate resources in the hope that their product will beat their competitors and diffuse through the \npopulation. But Geoffrey Moore, a consultant to technology companies, has shown that in sectors with strong \nnetwork effects, most companies fail to go from early adopters to mainstream users. Using Moore\u2019s \nmemorable phrase, they are unable to \u201ccross the chasm.\u201d41      \n \nExhibit 8 adds two elements to the diffusion process we have discussed. This is relevant where strong \nnetwork effects are in place. The first, in the upper right corner, is the fact that the products of most \ncompanies don\u2019t diffuse through the population. The second, at the bottom, is that while the cost to add users \nmay be high in the early phase of network formation, the cost per user drops rapidly once a network becomes \ndominant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The standard cost curve shows that as a \nmanufacturing company increases output, its marginal and average unit costs decline up to a point. For these \ncompanies, the positive feedback is driven by increased sales. This is called supply-side scale because the \nmore the company supplies, the lower is its cost per unit. This is classic increasing returns to scale. \n \nThis positive feedback tends to dissipate as the result of growing bureaucracy and complexity, or input \nscarcity. (See the left side of Exhibit 10.) This generally happens at a level well before dominance. As we have \nnoted, market shares in the industrial world rarely top 40 percent. \n \nFor combinatorial networks, network effects are the primary source of positive feedback. Rather than being \ndriven only by supply, network effects are driven by demand as well. Specifically, the value to the users \nincreases sharply once a network passes critical mass. Regardless of the cost of the supplier, customers are \nwilling to pay more for the good or service because the network is more valuable to them.  \n \nCompanies that win network battles enjoy lower costs as the result of supply-side scale and increase the value \nto the users as the network grows. If the company chooses not to raise prices in line with the increased \nwillingness to pay, the company creates large consumer surplus. These are the dual advantages in exhibit 9. \nExhibit 10 shows how these drivers affect a company\u2019s total value created. \n \nTake Google as an example.

But once finished, \nthe cost of replicating and distributing the code is modest.  \n \nThe combination of network effects and the cost characteristics of information goods can create a large \namount of value in a relatively short period of time.

No reference class is perfect, of course, but the base rate of performance can lend a vital point of \nview on the plausibility of a TAM estimate. Indeed, research shows that using base rates generally improves \nthe accuracy of forecasts.46     \n \nHere\u2019s an example of how the base rate approach can figure into your judgment of TAM. During a conference \ncall in February 2015, Elon Musk, the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Tesla Motors, suggested \nthe company might be able to achieve a 50 percent compound annual growth rate of sales for the next \ndecade off of a roughly $6 billion revenue base in 2015.47  \n \nYou can start checking the plausibility of that growth rate by considering the population, product, and \nconversion method. You would consider the size of the global automobile market, estimate the share for \nelectric cars in ten years, project Tesla\u2019s market share, and make some assumptions about vehicle prices. You \nwould go through a similar process for the company\u2019s battery business. In other words, you would do a reality \ncheck through a bottom-up analysis.  \n \nNext, you might consider the diffusion literature. The automobile industry has a rich history, including the rate \nat which innovations such as automatic transmissions, air conditioning, and radial tires have permeated the \nindustry.48 You might complement these analogies with transformations in other industries, including the \nmigration from traditional handsets to smartphones.    \n \nThe base rate method takes a totally different approach. It simply asks: \u201cWhat happened to other companies \nwhen they were in a comparable position?\u201d Exhibit 12 shows the distribution of 10-year sales growth rates for \nmore than 1,200 instances of companies of a similar size as Tesla is now, measured by sales. The average \ngrowth rate, adjusted for inflation, is less than three percent, with a standard deviation below eight percent. \nFurther, no companies achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in excess of 40 percent (and the \ndifference between 40 and 50 percent is enormous over a decade). We have placed a star at the growth rate \nMusk mentions.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n23 \nTAM and Ecosystems \n \nWhen Jack Welch retired as the CEO of General Electric (GE) in September 2001, the company had a lower \nshare of its TAM than when he assumed the job 20 years before. Executives estimated that GE\u2019s share of its \nTAM in 2001 was less than 10 percent, half of what it was in the early 1980s. \n \nGE\u2019s businesses performed well during Welch\u2019s tenure. The drop in share was the result of redefining the \nTAM to be much larger in 2001 than it was in 1981. The key to the expanded definition is the notion of \n\u201clinking and leveraging,\u201d or \u201ctransferring a user base built up upon one node of the ecology (one product) to \nneighboring nodes or products.\u201d49 The phrase the \u201cinternet of things\u201d reflects this opportunity.50  \n \nIncreasingly, companies seek to place their products or services at the heart of an ecosystem. Done \nsuccessfully, this creates three specific benefits. First, it allows the company to take advantage of network \neffects. Second, it encourages customers to remain within the ecosystem, making the customer economics \nattractive.51 Finally, it extends a company\u2019s period of competitive advantage.52  \n \nOne way to assess a company\u2019s ability to link and leverage is to consider three distinct business categories: \nphysical, service, and knowledge.53 Although the activities of most companies fall into more than one category, \nour objective is to understand the economic characteristics of each and to consider how companies can \nexpand across them. Here are the categories: \n \uf402\n Physical. Tangible assets, including manufacturing facilities, stores, and inventory, are the main source \nof cash flows for these businesses. Think of steel producers and retailers. Sales growth is tied closely to \nasset growth. \n \uf402\n Service. People are the main source of competitive advantage for service businesses. The essential \nelement is that companies in this category deliver their services on a one-to-one basis. Examples include \nlaw firms, advertising agencies, and consulting firms. Sales growth is tied to the number of employees \nand productivity. \n \uf402\n Knowledge. Knowledge businesses also rely on people as the main source of competitive advantage. \nUnlike service businesses, however, these companies create intellectual content once and then reproduce it. \nThink of software or biotechnology companies. Because the cost of replication is often low, there is no \ndirect link between sales and costs, which creates the potential for the business to scale rapidly. \n \nIt is important to consider carefully how these business categories differ in their economic characteristics (see \nExhibit 13). Some salient considerations include the following:  \n \uf402\n Source of advantage. While physical companies depend on tangible assets, both service and knowledge \nbusinesses rely on people. So, as a business extends beyond its reliance on physical assets, it must learn \nto manage physical and human capital. Further, employees who are integral to the process of value creation \ncommonly want to share the upside of the value they create. So, appropriate compensation arrangements \nand mobile internal labor markets are essential elements in achieving success. \n \uf402\n Investment trigger. Physical and service businesses grow by adding capacity, whether through capital \nexpenditures or new employees. For instance, a retail chain must build new stores to generate sales \ngrowth in excess of what the current stores can deliver. Or a law firm needs new lawyers to produce \nadditional sales. Naturally, physical and service businesses seek to maximize productivity, but the nature \nof the businesses limits the ability to scale.  \n"

While there are generally \nfew constraints on selling more of a current product, the rate of change for knowledge industries is \ntypically high. This means that there is little or no residual value for an outdated knowledge good. \n \nSoftware is a good example. A company that comes up with a popular product can fulfill demand cheaply \nand profitably, and enjoys substantial economies of scale. But the value of the old product plummets \nwhen a better one comes out. Companies with an established user base can migrate their customers \nfrom one of their products to the next, therefore mitigating the risk of obsolescence. \n \uf402\n Products and protecting capital. Economists distinguish between rival and nonrival goods. A rival \ngood is one where one person\u2019s consumption reduces the consumption of others. Pens and shirts are \nrival goods, because only one person can use them at a time. In jurisdictions with strong property rights, \nrival goods are straightforward to protect. A nonrival good is one that many people can use at the same \ntime. It is essentially a formula or recipe. Think of a song on iTunes. Nonrival goods are generally difficult \nto protect because they are relatively easy and cheap to replicate. So the creator of a nonrival good often \nhas difficulty capturing the value that he or she produces. Again, the music industry is a good example.    \n \nExhibit 13: Characteristics of Various Business Categories \n \n \n \n \nPhysical  \n \nServices  \n \nKnowledge \n \n \n \n \n \nSource of advantage  \n \n \nAssets \n \n \nPeople \n \n \nPeople \n \n \n \n \nInvestment trigger  \n \n \n \nCapacity  \n \nCapacity  \n \nObsolescence \n \n \n \n \nScalability \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLow  \n \n \nLow  \n \n \nHigh \n \n \n \n \nProducts  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRival  \n \n \nMixed  \n \n \nNonrival \n \n \n \n \nProtecting capital  \n \n \n \nEasy  \n \n \nHard  \n \n \nHard \n \n \n \n \nEconomies of scale \n \n \n \nSupply-side  \nSupply-side  \nDemand-side \nSource: Alfred Rappaport and Michael J.

This is how GE\u2019s share of TAM dropped even as its \nbusiness was growing. GE Healthcare, for instance, expanded beyond selling x-ray, computerized axial \ntomography, and magnetic resonance imaging machines by offering multi-vendor service and, ultimately, \nremote diagnostics.    \n \nDeere & Company is another case in point.

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n28 \nAppendix B: Satellite Radio Case Study \n \nWe show how to use the Bass model to forecast total demand for an industry by sharing the key findings of a \nHarvard Business School case study. Professor Elie Ofek and Peter Wickersham, authors of the case, explain \nhow to forecast demand for the U.S. satellite radio industry by coming up with appropriate approximations for \nthe parameters of the Bass model. They estimate the size of the market, m, based on assumptions about \nradio and subscription prices, and then establish the coefficient of innovation (p) and coefficient of imitation (q) \nusing judgments about satellite radio\u2019s degree of similarity to related products. We compare these forecasts in \nthe case study to the actual demand for satellite radio in the industry\u2019s first 13 years.   \n \nEstimating Market Size (m). The first step is to estimate the total market size, or m. Some markets are \neasier to assess than others. An example of a straightforward estimate is a new drug therapy that targets a \nspecific disease (consistent with Exhibit 2). You can confidently estimate the size of that market by figuring \nout how many people have the disease and how many are likely to be diagnosed. The potential demand for \nmost products or services is not as clear, particularly for those based on new technologies.   \n \nA useful place to start is a survey that gauges consumer interest and the likelihood of purchase. Robert Acker, \nthe director of strategic planning for XM Satellite Radio (XM) in the late 1990s, commissioned this market \nresearch for the U.S. satellite radio industry. The national telephone survey included more than 6,000 people. \nAcker designed the survey to provide useful information for XM\u2019s general strategy. For example, he sought \ninput on how best to target customers and how to position the service to be attractive.  \n \nThe survey also provided crucial insight into who might pay for the service and how much they might be willing \nto pay. XM had yet to determine its primary market, so Acker conducted the survey for radios in the car and at \nhome. Ofek and Wickersham\u2019s case study focuses on the car radio, then seen as the most likely market to \nsucceed.   \n \nBased on the survey results, Acker was able to make reasonable estimates for total demand based on the \ncost of the radio in the car and the monthly subscription fee. We summarize the results in exhibit 16. For \nexample, the projected demand is about 49 million customers for a radio price of $150 and a subscription \nprice of $5 per month. The wide range of outcomes shows the importance of sensitivity analysis. In the case, \nOfek and Wickersham assume m is 30 million based on a radio price of around $250 and a subscription price \nof about $10.  \n \nExhibit 16: Projected Demand at Different Price Levels for Car Radio and Subscription  \n \nSource: Elie Ofek, \u201cForecasting the Adoption of a New Product,\u201d Harvard Business School Case Study 9-505-062, December 12, 2013. \n \nEstimating p and q. The next step is to estimate the coefficient of innovation (p) and coefficient of imitation \n(q). One common approach is to identify similar products and assume that the parameters will be comparable \nfor your product.  \nDemand in millions\nRadio Price\n$2\n$5\n$8\n$10\n$12\n$100\n77.8\n68.3\n58.7\n54.0\n45.7\n$150\n53.0\n49.1\n44.1\n41.6\n35.6\n$200\n42.8\n40.5\n37.8\n36.5\n31.5\n$250\n32.6\n31.8\n31.2\n30.7\n26.6\n$300\n29.1\n28.9\n28.7\n28.5\n24.8\n$400\n27.7\n27.6\n27.5\n27.4\n23.7\nSubscription Price\n"

Ofek and \nWickersham advise that you should at a minimum choose analogies based on product and market \ncharacteristics. Additional elements to consider include the overall economic conditions, buyer behavior, \nmarketing strategy, and characteristics of the innovation. If no product serves as a perfect analogy, it is useful \nto consider several similar products. This is the approach the authors follow for satellite radio, and they \nultimately settle on three products: the portable CD player, the automobile radio, and the cellular phone.  \n \nThe next step is to search for the published estimates of the parameters for the analogous products. Appendix \nA provides estimates for a wide range of products, and you can find additional figures in other studies. \n  \nIn the case study, Ofek and Wickersham weight the importance of market structure and product \ncharacteristics to come up with estimates for p and q.

The score of similarity on product characteristics is 7 out of 10 for a weighted value of 4.2 \n(7.0 * 0.6). Combining the market structure and product characteristics gives the CD player a total weighted \nscore of 5.8.  \n \nThe authors follow the same approach for the other two products, and come to a total weighted score for all \nthree products of 18.2. The weighted contribution of the CD player is 31.9 percent (5.8/18.2). So, the \nweighted p for the CD player is 0.002 (0.006*0.319), and its weighted q is 0.210 (0.660 * 0.319). The sum \nof the weighted results for all three products provides the estimated parameters for satellite radio of 0.011 for \np and 0.492 for q. \n \nWe can plug our estimates of m, p, and q into the Bass model to get a forecast of total demand over time \n(see Exhibit 18). Because the coefficient of innovation, p, is much lower than the coefficient of imitation, q, \nthe model suggests a slow rate of adoption at first followed by a rapid rise once the industry realizes critical \nmass. After a few years, imitators overwhelmingly drive adoption (see Exhibit 19).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProduct\nMarket Structure \n(Similarity to \nSatellite Radio)\nWeight\nWeighted \nValue\nProduct \nCharacteristics \n(Similarity to \nSatellite Radio) Weight\nWeighted \nValue\nWeighted \nScore\nContri-\nbution\np\nWeighted \np\nq\nWeighted \nq\nPortable CD Player\n4 out of 10\n0.4\n1.6\n7 out of 10\n0.6\n4.2\n5.8\n31.9% 0.006\n0.002\n0.660\n0.210\nAutomobile Radio\n8 out of 10\n0.4\n3.2\n9 out of 10\n0.6\n5.4\n8.6\n47.3% 0.016\n0.008\n0.410\n0.194\nCellular Phone\n8 out of 10\n0.4\n3.2\n1 out of 10\n0.6\n0.6\n3.8\n20.9% 0.008\n0.002\n0.421\n0.088\nSum\n18.2\nSum\n0.011\nSum\n0.492\n"

      "text": " \n \nSeptember 1, 2015 \n \nTotal Addressable Market \n32 \nAppendix C: Diffusion and the Replacement Cycle * \n \nIn this appendix, we demonstrate the significance of the replacement cycle in understanding demand for an \nindustry. When forecasting demand for a product or service, analysts tend to focus primarily on the rate of \nnew adopters, or penetration. But the rate of new adopters is not the only thing that determines unit volumes \nover time.  \n \nThe rate at which customers replace their products, or the replacement cycle, can be just as meaningful as \nthe rate of adoption. If the replacement cycle is shortening, customers are replacing their products faster. If it \nis lengthening, customers are taking more time between purchase and replacement. For most products, a \ntime comes when replacement units are a majority of the total. And because products diffuse faster today, the \nreplacement cycle quickly becomes an important consideration.  \n \nWhen replacements become a large portion of total demand, an interesting and counterintuitive thing can \nhappen. If consumers expand the time between when they purchase and replace their products, total demand \ncan decline even if there is continued growth in population and penetration. You still have plenty of customers \nmaking their first purchase, but this new demand is more than offset by a large existing base of users who are \nwaiting longer between upgrades.  \n \nTo understand when to prioritize new users and when to focus on the replacement cycle, it\u2019s useful to \nconsider a simple three-stage model of the life of a product or service. The first stage is all about growth in \nnew users. The second stage is transitional and marks when replacements exceed new users for the first time. \nHere the analysis requires a balance between new users and replacement demand. The length and change in \nthe replacement cycle become essential inputs into a demand model. The third stage is maturity. The market \nis fully penetrated and the replacement cycle defines demand.  \n \nTo set the stage for our analysis, we begin by illustrating the typical pattern of diffusion for an innovation. The \npattern of cumulative users follows an S-curve (see Exhibit 21). While the S-curve shows cumulative product \nadoption, the plot of new adopters follows a normal distribution (see Exhibit 22).  \n \nExhibit 21: Generic S-Curve \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.  \nTime\nTotal Sales\n"

Replacements become a majority of the total within five to seven years for \nmany products and are the majority of demand for almost all industries within a dozen years.

Here, the priority is to gain widespread acceptance and increase penetration of \nthe new product or service. Replacement sales exist at this stage but their contribution is negligible. 3D \nprinters are in this stage today. \n \uf402\n Stage II\u2014Transition. In this stage, replacement demand exceeds demand from new users for the first \ntime. Your analysis should shift from determining the rate of new user growth to assessing the length and \npotential change of the replacement cycle. Smartphones are in this stage today. \n  \uf402\n Stage III\u2014Maturity. With the market fully penetrated, unit sales are comprised nearly solely by \nreplacement demand. Personal computers and laptops are in this stage today. \n \nExhibit 24: Three Stages of a Product's Life \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.  \n \nThis progression from Stage 1 to Stage 3 suggests three important considerations. The first is the drivers of \nthe replacement cycle. The second is whether or not the needs of customers change as a product matures \n(they do). The final, and arguably most critical, issue is how a shift in the replacement cycle affects total \ndemand. Here, it is possible for the decline in demand for replacement sales as the result of an expanding \nreplacement cycle to exceed the contribution of sales from new users.  \n \nA simple example demonstrates the large impact of a change in the replacement cycle. Exhibit 25 shows two \nscenarios. They are exactly the same except that Scenario 1 assumes the replacement cycle remains at 3 \nyears through all 15 years, while Scenario 2 assumes that the replacement cycle expands from 3 to 4 years \nfollowing the fifth year. \n \n \n \n \nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nReplacement Sales\nTotal Sales\nTime\nNew Users\n"

First, in Scenario 2 we see that total unit sales decline in year 6 \ndespite continued growth in population and penetration. (Exhibits 26 and 27 show the data behind these \ncharts.) Second, the seemingly modest shift from a three- to a four-year replacement cycle results in a \nmaterial drop in long-term demand.

These costs dampen profitability at low levels of \nsales but operating profit margins increase as sales grow. \u201cEconomies of scale\u201d exist when a company can \npursue activities as it gets larger. So operating leverage depends both on preproduction costs and sales, \nwhereas economies of scale are driven primarily by sales. See Alfred Rappaport and Michael J.
