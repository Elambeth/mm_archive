      "text": "Network to Net Worth\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nExecutive Summary\nNetworks have been around for a long time. But they are becoming a more\nsignificant part of the economic landscape for two primary reasons. First, the\nprecipitous drop in communication and computing costs means that people are\nmore connected than ever. As a result, networks can form more frequently, and\nat a faster rate, than ever before. Second, the global economy is rapidly changing\nfrom one based on physical assets to one based on intellectual assets. This\nshift has fundamentally and irrevocably altered the traditional links between\nsales and costs. The consequence is the creation of unprecedented amounts of\nshareholder value.\nKey points are as follows:\n\u2022 \nNetwork effects. Network effects exist when the value of a good increases\nbecause the number of people using the good increases. Network effects\nare also associated with Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which states that the value of a\nnetwork grows exponentially as new members join arithmetically. As\ninvestors, we are looking for two things. First, we are looking for\ncircumstances where network effects are intense. By definition, all networks\nhave network effects. But they have them to varying degrees. The strongest\nforms of network effects hinge on two drivers: interactivity and compatibility.\nSecond, we are looking for networks where a company\u2014and hence its\nshareholders\u2014can directly capture the benefit of network effects.\n\u2022 \nSuccessful networks can generate huge shareholder value. Networks can\ngenerate sales in myriad ways. Often, the more successful a network, the\nmore ways it can generate revenues. Networks based on intellectual assets\nhave particularly interesting economic dynamics. Most intellectual assets\nbusinesses have high up-front and low incremental costs. So when a\nnetwork reaches critical mass, its revenues grow at an increasing rate but\nits incremental costs stay negligible. Finally, we believe that networks offer a\nmeaningful source of competitive advantage as a result of sizable aggregate\nswitching costs.\n\u2022 \nGetting critical. Biological analogies are useful when thinking about\ninnovation diffusion. For example, a flu epidemic requires two things:\ninteraction among people and contagiousness. In fact, epidemics and the\ndiffusions of innovation both follow an S-curve. There are three things in\nparticular to note about network formation. First, interactive innovations,\nincluding networks, grow at a faster rate than noninteractive ones. Second,\nan individual\u2019s adoption threshold is defined by what people near him or her\ndo. Finally, the \u201csmall-world\u201d effect shows us how communications\ntechnology makes us more connected to one another than ever before.\n\u2022 \nThe rise of networks will affect everyone. While networks are important in\ntechnology industries, they are not a phenomenon confined to the new\neconomy. The eruption of business-to-business exchanges, many of which\nserve old-economy companies, is proof positive. These exchanges will\nprofoundly transform the way business is conducted in the future.\nTraditional companies increasingly understand this change and are insisting\non equity stakes in the new networks in return for their sponsorship and\nparticipation.\n"

While interconnected systems have always\nexisted, the digital revolution is fundamentally altering both network dynamics and\nnetwork economics.\nPhysical networks, from traditional telephone to high-capacity fiber-optic systems,\nabound. But virtual networks also exist. And even though users in a virtual\nnetwork are not physically linked, they greatly value the ability to interact. The\none element that unifies all networks is that their value depends on the number of\npeople connected to them.\nThis is known as a network effect. A network effect exists when the value of a\ngood increases because the number of people using the good increases. All\nthings being equal, it\u2019s better to be connected to a bigger network than to a\nsmaller one. Adding new customers typically makes the network more valuable\nfor all participants because it increases the probability that everyone will find\nsomething that meets their needs. So getting big fast matters, not only because\nit creates more value, but also because it assures that competing networks\nnever take hold. With large industry coalitions announcing the formation of\n\u201ceMarketplaces\u201d almost daily, the issues of network formation and network value\nare more important than ever.\nNetworks have been around, in some form, for a long time. So what\u2019s the big\ndeal? The big deal is that today\u2019s networks are commanding market values that\nare radically different than those of the past. This surge in value is attributable to\na host of factors. First, the physical capital needs today are lower than prior\nperiods. This lowering reflects not only a shift from tangible to intangible assets,\nbut also the fact that the cost of technology is declining. Second, since most\nnetwork formation costs are up-front, winning networks demonstrate increasing\nreturns as they expand. Third, the staggering increase in computing and\ncommunication power mean that networks can form more frequently, and faster,\nthan ever. Finally, networks can quickly spread globally owing to extraordinary\nscalability.\nHow did Yahoo! blossom to a $70 billion company with over 120 million users in\njust five years? Why is Sabre, an Internet travel and reservations company,\nawarded a market value that currently exceeds the combined market\ncapitalization of three prominent airlines? And why do some business-to-business\nhubs have valuations that exceed the entire productive output of their respective\nvertical industries?\nThe goal of this report is to answer these questions. We address the issue in\nthree parts. First, we explore some basic network dynamics, including the\nconcept of network effects and where they are most prominent. Second, we\ndiscuss networks and economic value, touching on the sources of value creation,\nthe economic characteristics of networks, and how they serve as a source of\nsustainable competitive advantage. Finally, we study the key issue of network\nformation in an attempt to understand how and why certain networks emerge as\ndominant.\n"

The erudite chess master requested that one humble grain of rice be placed\nin the first square of the chessboard on the first day, two meager grains on the\nsecond, four tiny grains on the third, and so on, until all sixty-four squares were\nfilled. (Once accomplished the inventor would collect the sum.) Little did the\nemperor know that granting the inventor\u2019s wish would force him to cede a great\ndeal more than he had the power to give. Assuming all the squares were\nreached, over 18.4 quintillion grains of rice would overflow the board. At a density\nof ten grains per square inch, the rice would actually cover the entire surface of\nthe earth!\n1\nInterestingly, by the time the midpoint on the board is reached\u2014the 32nd\nsquare\u2014only 4 billion grains of rice have amassed, or about enough to cover a\nhalf-acre of land. The full power of the exponential process is only realized\nduring the second half of the story. So what does this tale have to do with\nnetworks?\nPlenty, as it turns out. Twin exponential processes, which are just beginning to hit\ntheir stride, are fueling today\u2019s economy. Technology guru George Gilder calls\nthem the Law of the Microcosm and the Law of the Telecosm. The first states that\ncomputer processing power doubles every 18 months. This is commonly known\nas Moore\u2019s Law.\n2 It is estimated that we reached the 32nd doubling of computer\npower back in 1995.\nThe second is the Law of Telecosm, also powerful but not as well understood. It\nsays that the value of a network grows exponentially as nodes are added\narithmetically. This force is also known as Metcalfe\u2019s Law, named after\nBob Metcalfe\n3, inventor of Ethernet and founder of 3Com. In Metcalfe\u2019s words,\n\u201cWhen you connect computers together, the cost of doing so is n, but the value\nis n\n2, because each of the machines that you hook up gets to talk to all of the\nother machines on the network. When you graph that, you see that over time\nyour costs go down while the value of the network goes up.\u201d\n4 Metcalfe\u2019s\noriginal diagram (Figure 1) suggests that the aggregate value of compatibly\ncommunicating devices grows at a rate of square the number of units. The rise in\nnetwork system costs are linear, while the value creation is exponential. So, at a\nkey juncture\u2014the \u201ccritical mass crossover\u201d\u2014value surpasses costs and\ncontinues to explode.\n5\nFigure 1\nThe Systematic Value of Compatibly Communicating Devices\n$\nN\nCost \u2248 N\nValue \u2248 N 2\nCritical M ass\nCrossover\nDevices\nDollars\nSource: Clock of the Long Now, Brand, Stewart.\n"

      "text": "Network to Net Worth\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nMetcalfe\u2019s value formula can be stated more precisely as V = n\n2 - n. For example,\na network of three people has a theoretical value of six (9 - 3 = 6). This \u201claw\u201d also\ntallies the potential number of transactions that can occur in a network.\n6 A\nsupplemental member adds prospective new goods, providing direct benefits to\nall other network members.\nIn the case of a network of ten people, each person has nine other potential\nresources. The total value of the network is 90. Assuming the number of people\nin the network doubles, the value quadruples, to 380 (20\n2 \u2013 20 = 380). If the\nnetwork expands to 10 times its base size\u2014100 people\u2014the value swells 100\ntimes. When the bases reaches 1,000 times the number of people, the value\nrises a million times.\nMetcalfe\u2019s Law may not be an exact mathematical expression, but it sheds light\non an important idea. Economists, using more formal language, call this idea a\nnetwork effect. Network effects exist when the value of a good increases because\nthe number of people using the good increases. In a typical network, the addition\nof a new customer increases the willingness of all participants to pay for network\nservices. This is a defining feature of networks.\n7 As investors, we are interested in\nsituations where network effects exist and can be \u201cinternalized,\u201d or captured, by\nthe network \u201cowners\u201d or standard bearers. This value capture, in turn, is reflected\nin financial measures like sales and earnings growth.\n8\nThere are two major types of network effects: direct and indirect. Direct network\neffects exist when the value of a good changes as more agents consume that\ngood. For example, the value of eBay\u2019s network grows as more users join, as\nbuyers are provided with more choices and sellers are able to set higher prices.\nIndirect network effects arise when the value of a good increases as the number,\nor variety, of complementary products expands. For instance, the success of a\ncomputer operating system is not solely dependent on its technological\nadvantages, but also on how much complementary software is available in the\nmarket.\n9 And your DVD player becomes more valuable as more movies are\nreleased on DVD.\nNetwork effects not only come in different types. They also come in different\nlevels of intensity. As investors, we are particularly interested in situations where\nnetworks effects are both powerful and can be captured as shareholder value.\nWe address the issue of value creation in the following section. For now, we want\nto answer the fundamental question: How do you know when network effects are\nsignificant?\nThink of a traditional airline\u2019s hub-and-spoke network. As long as it effectively\ntakes you where you want to go, you probably don\u2019t honestly care if other\npassengers use the same service. But networks effects do exist, because the\naddition of more passengers allows the airline to expand routes and provide all\nusers with added services. In some cases, however, the network effects are\nrelatively weak. Yahoo! users checking news updates, getting stock quotes, or\nfinding weather information care little whether or not other users do the same. For\nthem, the product value flows from its intrinsic usefulness. However, these same\ncustomers are much more concerned with the value of the network if they put\nsomething up for auction or join in on a message board discussion.\n"

All of them hinge on two drivers: interactivity and compatibility.\nInteractivity means that there is a lot of contact among the members, or nodes.\nSuch interactivity allows individuals to impart value to the network. The more\ncontact, the stronger the potential network effects. Compatibility comes in a few\nforms: transactions, community, and devices. We address each of them in turn:\n\u2022 \nTransactions. A network based on transaction compatibility derives its value\nby creating a forum for exchange. As more and more participants flock to the\nforum to conduct business, network value grows. And if the exchange\ncaptures the majority of the buyers and sellers in a particular space,\ncompeting exchanges can never reach critical mass.\nA good example is eBay, the world\u2019s largest online trading community. eBay\nwas the first to attain scale in the auction space. Not surprisingly, its attractive\ngrowth and economic performance lured two other Internet heavyweights,\nYahoo! and Amazon.com, into the fray. But neither Yahoo!\u2019s huge installed\nbase and free listings nor Amazon.com\u2019s experienced e-commerce users\nproved enough to unseat eBay as the overwhelming market leader. Notably,\neBay\u2019s success came despite little proprietary technology. The key was\nvolume of users.\nFigure 3\neBay\neBay Membership Adoption\n0\n2,000\n4,000\n6,000\n8,000\n10,000\n12,000\n14,000\n16,000\n31-Mar-97\n31-Dec-97\n30-Sep-98\n30-Jun-99\nMar-00\nDec-00\nSep-01\nTime\nMembers (000)\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\n30,000\n35,000\n9/24/1998\n10/28/1998\n12/02/1998\n1/07/1999\n2/11/1999\n3/18/1999\n4/22/1999\n5/26/1999\n6/30/1999\n8/04/1999\n9/08/1999\n10/12/1999\n11/15/1999\n12/20/1999\n1/25/2000\n2/29/2000\n4/03/2000\nTime\nMarket Value (000,000)\n0\n2,500\n5,000\n7,500\n10,000\n12,500\n15,000\n17,500\nMembership (000)\nSource: Company published data, CSFB analysis.\nIn less than two years, eBay has grown from less than 1 million to a\nstaggering 12.6 million registered users.

So it\u2019s\neasy to see how eBay internalized these network properties to the benefit\nof their shareholders. The diagram on the left in Figure 3 shows eBay\u2019s\nmarket value relative to its growth in registered users. The registered\nuser data almost look like a trend line through the market-value data.\nHowever, it\u2019s not always so easy from an investor\u2019s perspective. The\nmarket is a discounting mechanism. So it\u2019s not important when the firm\nactually reaches critical mass. Rather, it\u2019s important when the market\nthinks the firm will reach critical mass. At that point, the market creates a\ntectonic shift in value creation, enriching the shareholders that had the\nforesight to jump on the wave.\n\u2022 \nCommunity. In networks with direct interaction between members, value\ngrows as more participants join the community. And once a community\nhas gathered, content providers, advertisers, and vendors are willing to\npay for access to that community.\nAmerica Online isn\u2019t typically thought of as an online community. But over\nthe last five years, it has managed to become an integral part of the U.S.\ncommunications network. In 1996, AOL naysayers insisted that a closed\nonline service with proprietary content would eventually collapse because\nof the Internet\u2019s free and open nature. The rise of cheap Internet service\nproviders and widespread offering of free e-mail promised a swift end for\nAmerica Online. But rather than fold, AOL thrived. Some of its appeal\nstemmed from its organized content\u2014as opposed to the scary, messy\nWeb\u2014and ease of use. But that wasn\u2019t the whole story. AOL also\nfacilitated communication among friends, family, and other members with\nsimilar interests. Stories proliferated about adults graduating from the\nInternet\u2019s \u201ctraining wheels\u201d only to find that their children had grown\nimpossibly attached to America Online\u2019s message boards, chat, and\ninstant messaging.\n11\nFigure 4\nAmerica Online\n0\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n200,000\n250,000\n12/31/1993\n6/27/1994\n12/19/1994\n6/14/1995\n12/06/1995\n5/31/1996\n11/21/1996\n5/19/1997\n11/10/1997\n5/07/1998\n10/29/1998\n4/27/1999\n10/19/1999\nTime\nMarket Value (000,000)\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\nMembership (000)\nAOL Membership Adoption\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\n30,000\n19-Sep-91\n31-Jan-93\n15-Jun-94\n28-Oct-95\n11-Mar-97\n24-Jul-98\n6-Dec-99\n19-Apr-01\n1-Sep-02\nTime\nMembers (000)\nSource: Company published data, CSFB analysis.\nInterestingly, studies have shown that computer adoption is not\nassociated with any kind of particular software but is highly correlated\nwith the use of e-mail and the Internet.

In addition to the merits of direct compatibility, the value of a\ndevice is often a function of ancillary devices, services, and software. For\nexample, the value of your VCR is in large part contingent on the number\nof videocassette tapes that you can play on it. Lots of tapes, lots of value.\nNo tapes, no value. As a device becomes more available, it spawns co-\nevolution of ancillary devices, services, and software, which in turn spurs\neven further growth for the device. Eventually, the device becomes a\nde facto standard (anyone still got a Betamax lying around?) providing\nthe producer with the potential for massive value creation.\nOperating system software is a good example. When you buy a new\noperating system, your decision is likely based on the intrinsic value of\nthe software package: features, speed, and compatibility with other\nproducts. Arrayed against this are the purchase cost, transition\nheadaches, and incompatibility issues. But ultimately, an operating\nsystem can\u2019t grow without compatible software applications.\n14 And the\ngreater the availability and growth of compatible applications, the higher\nthe value of the operating system, and vice versa.\nMicrosoft\u2019s operating system dominance began with a cost advantage\nover Macintosh. The Macintosh graphical user interface required more\ncomputing power than DOS, and hence the Mac was more expensive.\nFurther, DOS was faster than Macintosh, and many businesses were\nonly using computers for one application. These factors\u2014combined with\nsmall hard drives and limited interaction with the operating system\u2014\nmeant that the Mac\u2019s few advantages over DOS were outweighed by\ndisadvantages.\n15 The result: leading application software companies of\nthe day, including Lotus 1-2-3, Ashton-Tate, and WordPerfect, poured\nresources into developing DOS-based products. More compatible\nproducts, more value.\nEventually, Microsoft unveiled its own graphical-user-interface-based\nproduct, Windows. But it did so only after microprocessors became\nfaster, hard drives larger, and memory cheaper. Microsoft also made\nWindows backward-compatible so it wouldn\u2019t strand its existing user\nbase. The value of Microsoft\u2019s network of Windows users really took off\nwhen users quickly transitioned from DOS to Windows. By then, the\nmarket share battle had been won. DOS\u2019s early cost advantage was\namplified by the wave of application software written for it. The positive\nfeedback loop then kicked in. Microsoft became the focal point of the PC\nsoftware value chain, and it reaped extraordinary returns as a result.\nWe have now established the significance of network effects, and have outlined\nwhere they tend to be most powerful. Now we turn to the next subject: the\neconomics of networks.\n"

Excess returns can be expressed as the difference between\nrevenues and costs, while duration of excess returns can be articulated as\nsustainable competitive advantage. In this section, we explore the ways networks\ngenerate revenues, their cost dynamics, and how they sustain competitive\nadvantage. Analysis of these drivers provides us with a foundation for\nunderstanding the valuations afforded successful networks as well as how\nextraordinary wealth is created in very short time periods.\nWe have found that there are two dimensions of sales to consider: the source\nand the rate of growth. Both are important, but the rate of growth is particularly\ninteresting because it is nonlinear when strong network effects exist. And the\nstock market tends to be poor at accurately discounting nonlinear growth. Therein\nlies opportunity.\nBut first, we deal with the revenue sources. Here, we outline five major categories\nof sales. Many established networks gather sales from more than one of the\ncategories. In some instances, there are revenue opportunities that developed\nnetworks have yet to exploit. So these categories are meant to serve not only as\na means to classify sales, but also as a way to think about potential value\ncreation. The categories are as follows:\n\u2022 \nCommerce/transactions. Companies that are a de facto standard or\nstewards of a network can either sell goods directly or can steer\ncustomers to a transaction and collect a fee (indirect). Direct sales are\nconceptually straightforward and generally easy to track. The success of a\ncompany\u2019s indirect sales relates to its ability to reduce customer search\ncosts. Large networks that can effectively direct users are very valuable.\n\u2022 \nAdvertising. Large user networks are very attractive to advertisers\nbecause the users can be reached cost-effectively. Companies that have\namassed such groups can monetize them by selling advertising. Since an\nadvertising-based business model is typically only viable for companies\nwith a sizable user base, companies trying to build such a model often\ndiscount or give away their product in order to corral users. The giveaway\nis a costly means to a profitable end: becoming an attractive vehicle for\nadvertisers.\n\u2022 \nSubscription. Some successful networks can charge users a subscription\nfee, or dues, for access to a network and its content. Subscription models\nusually apply for one of two extremes: very specialized networks or very\nlarge networks.\n\u2022 \nData. One of the benefits\u2014and concerns\u2014of the digital age is an\nunprecedented ability to collect information. Companies with large user\nbases, especially ones that are Internet-based, have a treasure chest of\ndata about their customers that is valuable because it can be sold to third\nparties. These data can be either aggregated, hence skirting privacy\nissues, or used to offer specific consumer profiles.\n\u2022 \nIncubation. Once a network is established, it can \u201clink and leverage\u201d its\nposition into new business opportunities. An example is a model that is\nincreasingly ubiquitous on the Internet, where a company with a strong\nnetwork simultaneously buys an equity stake in another company and\npromotes it to the network (often for a fee). The network bearer can then\nwin in two ways\u2014with fee income and a potential equity upside.\n"

      "text": "Network to Net Worth\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nNow that we have outlined revenue sources, we can turn back to the issue of\ngrowth rates. To do that, we must introduce and explore the notion of positive\nfeedback. Positive feedback is the idea that the strong get stronger, which\nnecessarily includes the corollary\u2014the weak get weaker.\nPositive feedback has been around for a long time. For example, as a\nmanufacturing company increases its size, it often benefits from economies of\nscale. That is, as a company gets bigger, it lowers its average unit cost and\nimproves its economic returns. But for those companies\u2014and even for some\nnetworks where network effects are muted\u2014the positive feedback is supply-side\ndriven. It is based on a company\u2019s manufacturing or processing capabilities.\nEventually, the positive feedback dissipates because of size, bureaucracy, or\ncomplexity. And this generally happens well before a company reaches market\ndominance.\nFor networks, the primary source of positive feedback is network effects. And\nrather than being supply-side driven, network effects are demand-side driven.\nThis difference has two immediate and critical implications. The first is that once a\nnetwork passes critical mass (the subject of the next section), users want to join\nthe network, and will do so at the expense of competing networks. This desire\nleads to a surge in demand\u2014or nonlinear growth. The second implication is that\nfor networks based on intellectual property, market share is not governed by size.\nOne network can, and often does, become totally dominant, garnering market\nshares unthinkable in the physical world. Natural monopolies are the progeny of\nstrong network effects.\nNoted economist Brian Arthur says it more bluntly in what he has dubbed Arthur\u2019s\nLaw: \u201cOf networks there shall be few.\u201d In a particular space, one network tends to\ndominate, while the rest fight over the scraps. Network builders understand that\nanything other than first place is an also-ran.\nWe now turn our attention to the nature of costs. There are two fundamental ways\nto \u201cscale\u201d a business\u2014that is, to grow sales at a faster rate than costs. The first is\nto employ physical capital more efficiently. This tactic involves good old-fashioned\neconomies of scale. The second is growing a business that has low incremental,\nor variable, costs. High up-front and low incremental costs are a hallmark of\ninformation goods. Think of a piece of software. It takes a huge amount of human\ncapital to write the code the first time. But once finished, the cost of replicating\nand distributing that code is often very low.\nSo when network effects and the cost characteristics of information goods are\nintroduced to one another, the result is potentially explosive. A surge in demand-\nside driven sales, coupled with negligible incremental cost, leads to significant\nvalue creation. This is why some new economy networks have been able to\ngarner multibillion dollar valuations so quickly.\nThat is the good news. The bad news is that the up-front cost of developing a\nnetwork in an information-oriented domain is typically very significant. And if\nmultiple competitors see the same pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, they will\nall spend heavily to acquire users, knowing there is seldom an economic prize for\nthe runner-up.\nA network business\u2019s asset mix, then, heavily influences how it scales. Networks\nbased on physical assets tend to have moderate fixed costs and moderate\nvariable costs.\n16 Networks based on information assets tend to have high up-front\ncosts and low variable costs. Figure 5 includes a theoretical model that illustrates\nthe sizable margin impact. For a physical business with a 30% fixed/70% variable\ncost structure (company B), doubling output leads to a rough doubling in\noperating margins. For an information business with a 90% fixed/10% variable\ncost structure (company D), margins rise fourfold as output doubles.\n"

For example, some startups show scalability early on, but the\nsource of this advantage is vitally important. Although both sources of scalability\nbenefit from network effects, the trigger for reinvestment (i.e., additional costs) is\ndifferent for each. In a physical network, capacity constraints trigger reinvestment.\nAt a certain point, the network needs more infrastructure to support its growth.\nFor an information-based network, reinvestment is triggered by obsolescence.\nThese networks must keep their products or services up-to-date, or risk losing\nusers to a more technologically advanced offering.

We then looked at how networks generate economic value, noting\nthat information-based networks have potentially explosive economics. We now\nturn to the final question: How do networks form?\n17 And perhaps the even more\npressing question for investors: Is it possible to determine which network will win?\nIf you want to understand network formation, you can start by thinking about the\nflu. Actually, we\u2019re really interested in how the flu spreads. There are two key\ndimensions, both intuitive. The first is the degree of interaction\u2014that is, how often\npeople run into one another. The second is the degree of contagiousness\u2014how\neasily it spreads. If there is a lot of interaction, but the flu strand is not particularly\ncontagious, it will not take off. If the flu is very contagious but its carriers don\u2019t\ninteract with others, it will not take off. But combine contagiousness with\ninteraction, and you\u2019ve got an epidemic.\nFigure 6\nDisease Propagation\nTime\nInfections\nSource: Newman, M.E. J. and Watts, D. J., Scaling and Percolation in Small-World Networks.\nAs it turns out, the spread of innovations and the spread of diseases look the\nsame when graphed. They both follow an S-curve. That is, adoption starts off\nslowly and increases at an accelerating rate once the innovation (disease) takes\nhold. Not surprisingly, our biological analogy points to business-world parallels.\nThe degree of interaction can be thoughtfully modeled as the \u201csmall world\u201d effect.\nAnd susceptibility, or contagiousness, can be understood as adoption thresholds.\nWe will delve into these concepts in a moment.\nBefore we do that, we need to draw out another important distinction\u2014the\ndifference between the diffusion of \u201cnoninteractive\u201d and \u201cinteractive\u201d innovations.\nA noninteractive innovation is perceived to be increasingly beneficial to future\nadopters as more and more individuals adopt. So, it follows an S-curve. With\ninteractive innovations (including most networks with strong network effects), not\nonly do earlier adopters influence later adopters, but later adopters also influence\nearlier adopters. So the benefits from each additional adoption flow to all existing\nand future users. As a result, an interactive innovation follows a much steeper\nS-curve (see Figure 7).\n"

Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations.\nWe all know that only some innovations succeed. So what\u2019s the key to rapid\nadoption? The answer is that the good or service has to get to critical mass. The\nmetaphor comes from physics. Critical mass is the key to detonating an atom\nbomb. When the unstable nucleus of uranium breaks up, energy is released.\nNeutrons emanating from the breakup of one may hit another and cause it to\nbreak up, but most neutrons miss other nuclei and are projected harmlessly into\nspace. If, however, the quantity of uranium is appropriately condensed\u2014critical\nmass\u2014the typical neutron leaving one nucleus will hit another, and so on,\ncausing a self-sustaining chain reaction.\nSimilarly, an innovation is said to reach critical mass when it begins to increase at\nan accelerating rate. Even if active promotion of the innovation is disrupted, the\nprocess continues. The innovation is self-sustaining.\n18 And it becomes nearly\nimpossible for competitors\u2014or even the company\u2019s own management miscues\u2014\nto change the course. The authors of the Gorilla Game, a superb book on high-\ntechnology investing, offer a simple rule of thumb for when a company has gotten\nto critical mass: \u201cwhen year-to-year growth approaches or exceeds 100%, and\nwhen quarter-to-quarter growth is also rapidly accelerating.\u201d\n19\nWhy do people adopt an innovation? Individuals don\u2019t adopt an innovation solely\nbased on its intrinsic benefits. People are also influenced by what other people\ndo. But not all adopters are equivalent in their potential to be influenced.\nIndividuals have what\u2019s called an adoption threshold. An adoption threshold is\ndefined by how many other people must engage in an activity before a given\nindividual joins in as well. In innovation diffusion, a threshold is reached when an\nindividual adopts the technology because enough other people have already\ndone so.\nInterestingly, individual adoption is more heavily influenced by adoption in a\nuser\u2019s personal communication network than by aggregate adoption. This means\nthat the structure of communication networks is all-important when assessing\nhow the diffusion process works for interactive innovations. An innovation\nspreads much quicker over a network that has an average of six degrees of\nseparation than one that has sixty. The structure of social networks has been\nformally explored in the literature on the small-world effect.\n"

      "text": "Network to Net Worth\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nOne of the central ideas in the small-world literature is called clustering.\nClustering is the degree to which the connections to one node also connect to\none another. For example, in your friendship network, it\u2019s the degree to which\nyour friends are likely to know each other. Not surprisingly, many real-world\nnetworks are highly clustered.\nWhen modeling these networks, researchers discovered something fascinating:\nJust a few, random, long-range connections between local, clustered networks\ndramatically reduced the path link\u2014the degrees of separation. A social analogy\nwould be a tightly knit group of friends living in New York City, with a member still\nin contact with friends in Los Angeles. Just a few random links, and the overall\ndegree of separation plummets.\nSo what does this have to do with network formation? The tremendous potential\nvalue of a network is not a function of how many people have adopted it. Rather,\na network\u2019s potential comes from how many nonadopters are in the social cluster\nof the adopters. The true power of the network effect lies in the adoption cascade\nthrough the various social clusters. Given the degree of interconnectedness\nafforded by the Internet, the small-world effect suggests that network formation\nshould be more rapid than ever.\nIn fact, it is.\n20 Less than six months after its launch, Hotmail, a free e-mail service,\nregistered its one-millionth user. And less than 18 months later, the subscriber\nnumber shot up to over 12 million people. Another case in point is Napster, which\nprovides software that allows its users to automatically search and download\nMP3 files from other users. It has built a network of 9 million members in a span\nof just 6 months.\n21\nWe now summarize three key points:\n\u2022 \nInteractive innovations, including networks, grow at a faster rate than\nnoninteractive ones.\n\u2022 \nAn individual\u2019s adoption threshold is defined by how many other people in his\nor her social cluster engage in an activity before they join in as well.\n\u2022 \nThe small-world effect shows us how communications technology makes us\nmore connected to one another than ever before.\nSo far, our discussion has focused largely on the architecture of network\nformation. We will now review the process of formation. And for that, we turn to\nthe dean of diffusion, Everett Rogers. Rogers first published his oeuvre, The\nDiffusion of Innovation, in 1962. It remains a classic today.\nThe familiar S-curve represents cumulative adopters of an innovation. Rogers\nfound that the plot of new adopters tends to be a normal distribution. (See Figure\n8.) This finding allowed him to categorize adopters based on how early they are\nwilling to adopt an innovation relative to other members of a social system.\nRogers broke adopters into five groups based on statistical measures.\n22 Fans of\ntechnology strategist and \u2022ber author Geoff Moore\u2014especially his books Crossing\nthe Chasm and Inside the Tornado\u2014will find the graphic and nomenclature\nfamiliar. Crossing the chasm means getting to critical mass.\n23\n"

Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations.\nThe process starts with innovators and early adopters. Innovators are a group\nobsessed with \u201cventuresomeness.\u201d They are known for their technological savvy,\nand are willing to cope with the distinct possibility that the innovation will never be\nadopted in the mainstream. The innovators are the gatekeepers of new ideas.\nEarly adopters are more integrated with society than innovators, and are often\nopinion leaders. Since early adopters are often asked for advice, they understand\nthat they must make judicious innovation decisions.\nIn an attempt to get to critical mass, the early majority is the crucial group. The\ndistance between the early adopters and the early majority is the chasm that has\nto be crossed. The psychological profile of the early majority fits the old saying,\n\u201cBe not the first by which the new is tried, nor the last to lay the old aside.\u201d\n24\nConsequently, they tend to be cautious before completely embracing a new idea.\nBut they are a large group and provide a key ingredient that an innovation\nneeds\u2014legitimacy.\nInteractive networks encourage adoption by providing the early-majority\nincentives that a regular network cannot supply. Once an interactive network has\ntaken root, strong network effects provide benefits that fit neatly with the needs of\nlater adopters, thus accelerating overall adoption rates. In contrast to the\ninnovators and early adopters, the early majority can clearly see the benefit of\nnetwork effects and factor them into the decision-making process. Transaction\nnetworks have more liquidity, device markets more complementary products, and\ncommunity networks more members with which to interact. Interactivity becomes\na substantial input in the value calculus above and beyond the intrinsic product\nmerit.\nExhaustive studies of innovation diffusion show that the point of critical mass is\ntypically between 5% and 20% penetration of the total market served. Beyond\nthis point, increased adoption becomes self-sustaining. Moore calls this period of\ngrowth \u201cthe tornado.\u201d\nCritical mass can also be viewed as the \u201ctipping point.\u201d\n 25 When two or more firms\ncompete for a market where there is strong feedback, one typically emerges as\nthe winner. The point of no return, where one company\u2019s success begets further\nsuccess, is called the tipping point.\n26\nA simple example makes the point.

Provided you are really indifferent with regard to the offerings,\nyou might pick one restaurant at random and try it out.\nNow imagine another group of diners arrive just a few moments later. Which\nrestaurant are they likely to choose? Well, they probably look in the window, see\nsome people eating at one restaurant, while the other is empty. Chances are\nyou\u2019ll have company. And all of the groups that follow will be influenced by your\nrandom choice. Positive feedback made one restaurant a winner\u2014at least for a\nnight.\nThe real message in the tipping point is an economic one. Typically, one or more\ncompanies will vie to become the network of choice. Early market-share gains are\nboth challenging and expensive. But if by skill, foresight, or luck one company\ngets a lead in a \u201ctippy\u201d market, positive feedback is likely to carry it to the tipping\npoint, or to the point of critical mass. From there, it is shareholder value nirvana:\nmarket share rises precisely as the cost of gaining that market share declines.\n27\nFigure 9 provides a complete map of critical mass. Critical mass can be\ndescribed in three ways:\n\u2022 \nThe inflection point\u2014or elbow\u2014in an S-curve.\n\u2022 \nThe transition from the early adopters to the early majority\u2014 or \u201ccrossing the\nchasm.\u201d\n\u2022 \nThe tipping point, where incremental market share comes at incrementally\nlower costs.\nWhile our discussion has largely dwelled on the mechanics of network formation,\nwe cannot lose sight of the fact that most networks never get to critical mass.\nEqually important to stress, however, is that a network or innovation that is\nintrinsically valuable won\u2019t necessarily win in the marketplace.

But they are becoming a much more\nsignificant part of the economic landscape for two primary reasons. First, the\nprecipitous drop in communication costs\u2014including the tsunami called the\nInternet\u2014means that people are more connected than ever. As a result, networks\ncan form more frequently, and at a faster rate, than ever before.

Network effects played a prime role in\nMicrosoft\u2019s ability to create $350 billion in market value over the past 15 years.\nAnd eBay, not even five years old, commands a $20 billion market capitalization\nbecause of the extraordinary virtual transaction market it has built.\nYet this is not a phenomenon confined to the new economy. The eruption of\nbusiness-to-business exchanges, many of which serve old-economy companies,\nis proof positive.\n28 These exchanges will profoundly transform the way business is\nconducted in the future.\n29 Traditional companies increasingly understand this\ntruism, and are insisting on equity stakes in the new networks in return for their\nsponsorship and participation.\nIt is our view that all business decision-makers\u2014including managers and\ninvestors\u2014should become intimate with the ins-and-outs of networks.\nBut there is no panacea here. The balance of evidence suggests that many\nnetwork opportunities amount to winner-take-all. Even for those that win, the size\nof the addressable market can limit their fortunes.

Networks where only some\ncomponents are complementary to each other are dubbed \u201cone-way\u201d networks.\nNetworks where all the components are complementary are called \u201ctwo-way\u201d\nnetworks. Network effects arise because there is complementarity between the\ncomponents of the network. Formally, networks are composed of links that\nconnect nodes. Two basic network structures are shown in Figure 11. The figure\non the left is a simple star network where peripheral nodes (A,B,C, etc.) orbit the\ncentral node S. On the right is a financial intermediation network where\nrepresentatives on the demand side (D1D2Dm) and supply side (S1S2Sn) meet at\nexchange E.\nFigure 11\nNetwork Classification\nS\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nA\nG\nE\nD1\nD2\nS1\nS2\nSn\nDm\nSource: Economides, Nicholas, Network Economics with Application to Finance.\u201d\nAssuming the star network on the left is a basic telecommunication network, a\nphone call from A to B is composed of AS and SB, where S is the switching\nservice. Though AS and BS look very similar, they are in fact complements and\nnot substitutes. Since AB and BA are distinct goods\u2014the call originating from A\nand received at B versus the call originating at B and received at A\u2014the network\nis called a two-way network. Traditional two-way networks include railroad, road,\nand many types of telecommunication networks.\nIn the financial intermediation network, agents on the demand side and supply\nside want to engage in a \u201ctrade,\u201d matching their offer with another offer. In this\nway, an offer to buy D1E is complementary with a matching offer to sell S1E, but\nby definition it is not complementary with any other offers to buy or sell. In this\nsetup, ASB, BSA, and ASC are all composite goods made up of complementary\ncomponents. In a one-way network, customers are not identified with individual\ncomponents, but instead demand composite goods. Since, D1E S1 is identical to\ngood S1E D1 (as opposed to the telecommunications network, where AB and BA\nare distinct goods), the configuration is a one-way network. In addition to most\nfinancial exchanges, other traditional one-way networks include paging and\nbroadcast networks.\nIt is important to note that the topology of the network doesn\u2019t determine whether\na network is one-way or two-way. The star network on the left could just as easily\nbe a paging network, where A pages E through radio tower S. Since ESA is not\nfeasible except as a separate good, the network is determined to be one-way.\n"

The addition of a\nnew node in the network positively affects the complementary components.\nAdding one more node in an n-node network creates 2n new products. In a\nfinancial intermediation network where a new offer to buy or sell will ultimately be\nmatched with only one counterparty, the number of potential transactions\nincreases by 2n as well (assuming everyone in the network can take either side\nof the transaction at any given time).\n"

The number represented by\nz is called the coordination number, but here we call it the acquaintance number.\nFigure 12\nRandom Graph\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nA has Z2 second neighbors\nA has Z3 third neighbors\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nIf we were to make a chart and connect all the people in a network together with\nlines (\n1/2Nz) drawn between randomly chosen pairs, the result would be a random\ngraph. If the coordination number is two, then a typical person (A) would have two\nacquaintances. These two acquaintances would, in turn, have two other\nacquaintances. The result is a situation where A would have z\n2 (4) second\nneighbors and z\n3 (8) third neighbors (as seen in Figure 12). The diameter (d) of\nthe network, or the total degrees of separation among users of the network, is a\nfunction of the increase in the total people that join the network. In a completely\nrandom graph, the degrees of separation will only increase logarithmically as the\ntotal population grows. Thus, the number of degrees of separation can be quite\nsmall even in a very large or growing network.\nWhile this random graph does describe a small world, it has a number of\nproblems that hinder its use as a model for real-world social networks. Taking the\nabove example, it is not really true to say that A has z\n2 or four neighbors that are\ntwo degrees removed. In most social networks, the probability that the two friends\nof my friend are also acquaintances of mine is usually high. This condition is\ncalled clustering, and it is ubiquitous in social networks.\n"

      "text": "Network to Net Worth\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nFigure 13\nNetworks\nSource: M. E. J. Newman, Small Worlds: The Structure of Social Networks.\nA regular network is depicted on the left-hand side of Figure 13. It is highly\nclustered in that each node, or person, is connected not only to his or her\nimmediate neighbor but also to each neighbor\u2019s neighbors. However, this\nconfiguration represents a \u201clarge\u201d world. As the number of nodes on the network\ngrow, the average degrees of separation begin to grow linearly as well. Contrast\nthis with the completely random network, where the average degrees of\nseparation increase much more slowly as the number of nodes increase. Since\nrandom networks still need to confront the clustering issue, the solution comes in\nthe form of a regular network, with some links randomly \u201crewired.\u201d\nThis outcome is depicted in the center of Figure 13, where each of the links on\nthe lattice is assigned a probability that it will be rewired, meaning that one of its\nends will be moved to a new position. For a low probability of rewiring, the\nresulting graph is still very regular, but a number of connections are spread a long\ndistance across the lattice. To use a social analogy, think of a tightly knit group of\nfriends living in New York City, with one of the members maintaining contact with\nfriends in California. Even with a tiny amount of random links, the overall degrees\nof separation between nodes are remarkably similar to a fully random network.\nThe small-world phenomenon is a generic feature for many large, sparse\nnetworks. In essence, it only takes a few shortcuts to reduce the size of the world.\nFigure 14\nEmpirical Examples of Small-World Networks\nNetwork\nN = nodes\nl = avg separation\nl = random separation\nC = clustering\nC = random\nMovie Actors\n225,226\n3.65\n2.99\n0.79\n0.00027\nNeural Network\n282\n2.65\n2.25\n0.28\n0.05\nPower Grid\n4941\n18.7\n12.4\n0.08\n0.0005\nSource: Strogatz, Steven H.; Watts, Duncan J., Collective Dynamics of \u2018Small-World Networks.\nFar from being just a mathematical ideal, the three real networks in Figure 14\nnonetheless exhibit small-world effects. When clustering is taken into account,\nthe average degrees of separation between nodes do not vary substantially with\na completely random network containing the same amount of nodes. Since the\nvalue of l in these networks is quite low when compared with the number of\nnodes, there is clearly a small-world effect at work.\nIn addition to the explanation that the small-world phenomenon arises from a\ncouple of long-range connections in an otherwise short-range social network,\nother theories have emerged. The author Malcolm Gladwell has proposed an\nalternate small-world model, as depicted to the far right of Figure 13. Under this\nmodel, a few nodes in the network have unusually high coordination numbers.\n"

A more clear relationship would show the critical mass crossover of two lines y=x^2\nand y=ax +b with the y-axis representing value and the x-axis representing the number of nodes in the\nnetwork. Metcalfe\u2019s original diagram was taken from Brand, Stewart, The Clock of the Long Now: Time and\nResponsibility: The Ideas Behind the World\u2019s Slowest Computer, Basic Books, New York, 2000.\n6 In our three-person network (let\u2019s call the members A, B, and C), A can transact with B or C, B can transact\nwith A or C, and C can transact with A or B, summing to six.\n7 Economides, Nicholas, \u201cNetwork Economics with Application to Finance,\u201d Financial Markets, Institutions &\nInstruments, vol. 2, no. 5, December 1993, pp. 89-97.\n8 When network effects were first discussed in the economics literature, they were widely called \u201cnetwork\nexternalities.\u201d However, network effects and network externalities are not necessarily the same thing. An\neconomic externality occurs only when a decision-maker does not confront, or bear, the full costs or benefits\nof an action. In the most popular example of an externality, automobile pollution, car users confront many of\nthe costs associated with the use of an automobile (gas, oil, wear and tear, insurance rates, and even\nhighway repairs through the tax on gasoline), but not all of them. As car owners drive along, they pollute the\nair with fumes and noise, and slow down other drivers. Because these costs are largely borne by other\ndrivers that do not confront the offending driver with remunerative demands at the end of the day, they are\ncalled negative externalities. An externality does not have to be negative. A simple example of a positive\nexternality is when someone takes the time to spruce up his or her yard. In so doing, he or she  also benefits\nthe neighbor\u2019s view without receiving any form of compensation. Notably, for some networks, the benefits of\nadding additional users can be \u201cinternalized,\u201d or captured by the \u201cowners\u201d and users of the network. In this\ncase, the network is said to exhibit network effects, but without an externality.\n9 In a typical one-way network, network effects are primarily indirect. When there are m varieties of\ncomponent A and n varieties of component B (all A-type goods are compatible with all B-type), there are mn\npotential composite goods. An extra customer yields indirect network effects by increasing the demand for\ncomponents of type A and B, potentially increasing the number of varieties of each component as well.\n10 The top of the curve was determined by assuming that eBay will no longer grow. If it does indeed grow,\nthen the curve will ultimately look steeper, consistent with an interactive innovation.\n11 Swisher, Kara, aol.com, Random House, New York, 1998.\n12 Goolsbee, Austan, \u201cEvidence on Learning and Network Externalities in the Diffusion of Home Computers,\u201d\nUniversity of Chicago, July 1999.\n13 Another more direct example of the value of a community-based network is the price paid to acquire it.\nNumerous deals were inked in 1998 and early 1999 merging various digital networks of interacting\nmembers. Yahoo! purchased Geocities with its 19 million users, Lycos acquired the 1 million members of\nTripod for $58 million, and Go2Net snatched up 100,000 individual investors of the Silicon Investor network\nfor $33 million.\n14 Aside from direct compatibility.\n15 Liebowitz, Stanley J.; Margolis Stephen E., Winners, Losers & Microsoft : Competition and Antitrust in High\nTechnology, Independent Inst., California, 1999 Although the authors argue that Microsoft\u2019s success came\nsolely from the intrinsic merits of its offering and not network effects, we disagree. Compatible device\nnetwork effects have a strong influence on the early majority.\n"

For example, a commission paid to\nsalespeople for their production would be a variable cost. A fixed cost is a cost that remains constant even\nas output increases. The property taxes due on a company\u2019s facilities are an example. Utilizing the language\nof fixed and variable costs, a basic model can be constructed to highlight the effects of cost structure on the\nmargins of a growing business.\n17 Many frameworks have been devised to assess the ability of an innovation to get to critical mass. Most can\nbe classified along the following qualitative dimensions:\n31\nRelative advantage\u2014The degree to which the innovation is perceived to be better than what came before it.\nCompatibility\u2014The degree to which the innovation is perceived to operate within the framework of the prior\nvalues of users.\nComplexity\u2014The degree to which users perceive the innovation to be complicated.\nTrialability\u2014The degree to which an innovation can be used on a trial basis, without full commitment and\nwithout complete disruption to what it replaces.\nObservability\u2014The degree to which others can readily perceive the use of the innovation and mimic\nadoption.\nReinvention\u2014The degree to which the innovation can change and adapt as it diffuses to meet the\nunanticipated needs of users.\nThis framework comes courtesy of Everett Rogers.\n18 It\u2019s important to note that critical mass does not refer to the cumulative amount of people that have\nadopted, but to the number of nonadopters that these agents of change actually influence.\n19 Gorilla Game, p. 211.\n20 Jeff Bezos stated that before the Internet, growth like this had only been seen in a petri dish.\n21 \u201cCan Napster be Stopped? No!\u201d Bill Gurley, Fortune, April 17 2000.\n22 The innovativeness variable is partitioned into five adopter categories by laying off standard deviations\nfrom the average time of adoption.\n23 Moore\u2019s forthcoming book, Living on the Fault Line: Managing for Shareholder Value in the Age of the\nInternet, is terrific and highly recommended.\n24 This line comes from An Essay on Criticism by Alexander Pope, and was used by Everett Rogers to\ncharacterize the early majority of adopters\n25 Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s The Tipping Point is dedicated to the concept.\n26 In Amazon.com\u2019s 1999 annual report, CEO Jeff Bezos writes, \u201cWe believe we have reached a \u2018tipping\npoint,\u2019 where this platform allows us to launch new e-commerce businesses faster, with a higher quality\ncustomer experience, a lower incremental cost, a higher chance of success, and a clearer path to scale and\nprofitability than perhaps any other company.\u201d\n27 It\u2019s important to note that not all markets tip, and not all network products witness an inevitable adoption\ncycle due to tipping.\n28 For a good summary, see \u201cOnline Supply Networks Boom, But Some Major Hurdles Loom\u201d by Clare\nAnsberry, Wall Street Journal, April 17, 2000.\n29 These exchanges create value through two different mechanisms, aggregation and matching. Aggregation\nbrings a large number of buyers and sellers together under one roof, reducing transaction costs through the\nprovision of \u201cone-stop shopping.\u201d The matching mechanism brings buyers and sellers together to negotiate\nprices on a real-time basis. Under the aggregation mechanism, adding another buyer to the hub only\nbenefits sellers, for there is no swapping of roles. This is unlike the matching mechanism, where it is\npossible that buyers are also sellers. The matching mechanism benefits from stronger network effects, by\nimproving the overall transaction value.
