The \nidea is that most people place greater value on a dollar today than \na dollar in the future. Spending money now allows you to consume \nwith certainty. Saving money allows someone else to consume \nnow. The rate of return on your savings compensates you for \ndeferring consumption. \nEdward Chancellor, a financial journalist, asks his readers to \nimagine the present and future as two countries separated by a \nriver. Finance is the bridge that connects them. Interest is the toll \nthat those who want to consume now must pay and, equivalently, \nthe fee earned by those willing to defer their consumption. The \nlevel of the interest rate regulates the movement of capital.1 \nFor example, assume that you decide to invest your savings by \nbuying a bond issued by a company. The company, in turn, \nspends the proceeds seeking to earn an attractive rate of return. \nIf everything works out, the company pays you interest on a timely \nbasis and returns the principal when the bond matures. The \ncompany gets to invest today and you get to earn a return for \nwaiting to use the money.   \nThe value of any financial asset is the present value of the future \ncash flows. Valuation starts with an assessment of the magnitude, \ntiming, and riskiness of cash flows. You then discount tomorrow\u2019s \ncash flows at an appropriate interest rate, or cost of capital, to \ndetermine the value today. Investors determine the cost of capital \nbased on their opportunity cost, or the value of the next best \nalternative.   \nThe cost of capital is a measure of both expected return, which \ntakes us from the present to the future, and the discount rate, \nwhich takes us from the future to the present. Expected returns \ncome with varying degrees of certainty, but in all cases a single \nnumber reflects a distribution of potential outcomes.   \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Periods when the cost of capital is high are followed by periods of returns \nthat are above normal, on average, and a low cost of capital tends to precede subpar returns.2  \nCompanies access external capital from investors, primarily in the form of debt and equity, and invest it with the \nintention of earning a return in excess of the cost of capital. The expected risk and return are lower for debt \nholders than for equity holders because debt has a senior claim on cash flows. Debt holders get paid before \nequity holders do.  \nThe terms of debt financing, the magnitude and timing of cash flows, are established by contract. Investors are \nleft to determine only the risk that the company will fail to fulfill its obligations and what they might recover in the \ncase of default. Changes in interest rates, inflation, and overall economic conditions influence the cost of debt, \nbut the rights of the debt holders are stated plainly. \nYou can think of equity as a residual claim, or what\u2019s left over after subtracting the claims of debt holders and \npreferred shareholders. Companies that earn a return on investment in excess of the cost of capital create value \nfor shareholders because other claims have been satisfied and the additional value accrues to the equity holders.  \nThis report is a practical guide to estimating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a company. \nAcademic approaches to estimating the cost of capital have been criticized in recent decades, and we will \ndiscuss some of the issues of concern.3 Our goal is to find a figure that reflects opportunity cost sensibly, is \neconomically sound, and provides the investor and businessperson with a solution to apply to the problem. \nEstimating the cost of debt is relatively straightforward because the details of the agreement between the \ncompany and the investor are clear. Investors may disagree with the market\u2019s assessment of a bond price, but \nthe company\u2019s obligations are in plain view.  \nEstimating the cost of equity is more difficult because none of the determinants of value are explicit. Dividends, \nwhich do reflect elements of the magnitude and timing of cash flows, are at best a quasi-commitment to return \ncash to shareholders. And unlike a measure such as yield to maturity on a bond, there is no transparent method \nto observe a stock\u2019s expected return. Equity investors need to assess the expectations for the magnitude, timing, \nand riskiness of future cash flows. Ascribing a value to equity is almost always harder than to debt for this reason.  \nMethods to assess the cost of equity are commonly based on a model of asset pricing. The capital asset pricing \nmodel (CAPM) is the most popular among financial executives and investors.4 Despite its widespread use, the \nCAPM has come under fire in recent decades. The focal point is beta, which attempts to capture risk by \nmeasuring the sensitivity of a stock\u2019s returns relative to those of the market. Beta does a poor job of predicting \nactual reward. Academics have introduced additional factors in an attempt to better reflect the relationship \nbetween risk and reward.5   \nWe are not defenders of the faith in the CAPM. But we believe the model, especially with methods to reduce the \nerror in beta, is a useful complement to other indicators of risk and reward that have market prices, including \nbond yields and implied volatility in option prices. These measures can provide guidance and context for \nestablishing a reasonable cost of capital.  \nNearly all investors acknowledge that the present value of future cash flows determines the value of a stock, but \nmany believe a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is unreliable. For example, they point out that predicting cash \nflows is challenging, much of the value commonly resides beyond the explicit forecast period and has to be \ncaptured in the continuing value, and the overall output is very sensitive to small changes in the cost of capital.  \n"

These include price/sales \n(P/S), price/earnings (P/E), enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization \n(EV/EBITDA), and price/book (P/B). Indeed, a survey of almost 2,000 professional equity analysts found that \n\u201cmarket multiples\u201d were \u201c[b]y far the most popular approach to valuation.\u201d Analysts use P/E and EV/EBITDA \nmultiples most frequently.6  \nThe problem is that multiples are at best a proxy for the process of valuation. Using a multiple does not \ncircumvent the problems with forecasting cash flows and discount rates but rather buries them. We believe that \nit is better to make the assumptions explicit, debate them, and consider alternative scenarios.  \nThere is not a lot of upside in coming up with a sensible cost of capital but there is a lot of downside in applying \na figure foolishly. The goal is to blend the economic logic of an asset pricing model with market prices in order \nto estimate intelligently the opportunity cost of capital. The danger is applying formulas without thought. Charlie \nMunger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has said, \u201cPeople calculate too much and think too little.\u201d7 A \nsound estimate of the cost of capital requires some thinking. \nSuccessful investing is ultimately about properly anticipating revisions in expectations about future cash flows. \nThe rate at which those cash flows are discounted is important but is overwhelmed in the long run by getting the \ncash flows right. We recommend settling on a practical cost of capital and then allocating the bulk of analytical \ntime and attention to thinking about the potential paths of cash flows. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6422586 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n5\n \nHigh-Level View of the Cost of Capital  \nThe cost of capital for a company is the opportunity cost for investors in the setting of a diversified portfolio.  \nThe cost of capital is based on the economic principle of substitution. An investor will not invest in an asset if a \ncomparable asset exists that is more attractive, including consideration for risk. This means that an investor will \nbuy the asset with the highest return for a given level of risk, or the lowest risk for a given level of return. This \npresumes that more risk is associated with more reward.  \nExhibit 1 shows this relationship over 20 years for 8 asset classes (5 in equities and 3 in credit) and inflation. \nStandard deviation, a measure of variation for a set of values, is the proxy for risk, and total shareholder return \n(TSR) reflects reward. \nExhibit 1: Risk and Reward for Eight Asset Classes and Inflation, 2003-2022 \n \nSource: FactSet; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Indexes: MSCI Emerging Markets, Russell 1000, Russell Midcap, Russell 2000, MSCI World, Bloomberg 7-10 Year \nU.S. Treasury, Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond, Bloomberg 1-3 Month U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. Consumer Price Index. \nPortfolio diversification reduces the specific risk of an individual stock, or asset class, but even a portfolio that is \nfully diversified is exposed to market risk. What matters for a particular security or asset class is its contribution \nto the risk of a diversified portfolio. For instance, the standard deviation of returns for the stock of WD-40 \nCompany, a producer of oil for lubrication, is much higher than that of the market, but adding the stock to a \nportfolio reduces risk because the stock tends to zig when the market zags.8 The focus is not on the risk of the \nstock but rather how that security affects the risk of the overall portfolio.  \nThe cost of capital is a link between corporate finance and investing (see exhibit 2). Companies use the capital \nthat investors save. Companies seek to invest capital, which includes funds generated by the business, at a rate \nof return above the cost of capital in order to create value. These capital allocation decisions apply to mergers \nand acquisitions (M&A), internally-generated intangible investments, capital expenditures, and working capital.9 \nCompanies can only invest so much before the return on investment drops below the cost of capital. \n0%\n1%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n5%\n6%\n7%\n8%\n9%\n10%\n11%\n12%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\nTSR (Annual)\nStandard Deviation\n"

Investors must evaluate investment \nopportunities with an eye toward making sure there is an appropriate reward for the risk they take. Investors \nvary in their risk appetites but all seek to earn a proper payoff. \nExhibit 2: The Link between Companies and Capital Markets \n \nSource: Based on G. Bennett Stewart, III, The Quest for Value: A Guide for Senior Managers (New York: HarperCollins, \n1991), 83. \nA company\u2019s balance sheet has assets on the left and liabilities and equity on the right. Assets are the resources \na company employs to generate cash flows. Liabilities and equity are the way a company finances those \nresources. Debt and equity are the most popular forms of financial capital.  \nDebt is a contractual obligation between a company and its lenders, in which the company pledges to make \ntimely payments of interest and to return principal at the end of a period that is specified by contract. Equity is \ntechnically a contract between a company and its shareholders that confers limited rights to shareholders, which \ninclude the right to vote, transfer ownership, and collect dividends.10 \nPractically, common equity represents a claim on future residual cash flows. The claim is on cash flows after a \ncompany has paid other stakeholders, including creditors (interest and principal), suppliers (accounts payable), \nthe government (taxes), and employees (wages).  \nWe have so far used the standard deviation of asset price changes as a measure of risk. But you can think of \nrisk more fundamentally as a combination of business risk and financial risk:11  \nCorporate risk = business risk + financial risk  \nBusiness risk, or asset risk, reflects the variability of operating cash flows. Operating leverage, which measures \nchanges in operating profit as the result of changes in sales, is an important determinant of business risk.12 The \nratio of fixed to variable operating costs helps explain operating leverage, especially in the short run. Firms with \nhigh fixed and low variable costs have more operating leverage than those with low fixed and high variable costs. \nFinancial risk is determined by the amount of debt a company assumes. The interest expense from debt \neffectively adds a fixed cost and makes the earnings more volatile. \nReturn\nProspective Investments\nCorporate\nWACC\nReward\nRisk\nInvestor\nRisk-\nFree\nRate\n"

The first has no debt, so pre-tax \nprofit and operating profit are the same. The second has debt that incurs $20 in interest expense, which means \nthat its pre-tax profit is $80.  \nNow assume that both companies increase their operating profit to $120. The first company will enjoy a 20 \npercent increase in pre-tax profit (from $100 to $120), while the second company will realize 25 percent growth \nin pre-tax profit (from $80 to $100). Naturally, the math also has a similar effect on the downside. Even with the \nsame operating income, profits are more volatile for the second company than they are for the first. Empirically, \ncompanies with high business risk tend to have low financial risk, and companies with low business risk benefit \nfrom having some financial risk.13 \nFranco Modigliani and Merton Miller (M&M), economists who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic \nSciences, developed a theorem in the late 1950s showing that the value of a firm is independent of its capital \nstructure.14 Their point, which ran against the conventional wisdom of the time, was that a change in the capital \nstructure does not change risk overall but rather simply transfers risk from one stakeholder to another.  \nThe cost of debt also goes up when a company adds debt because the size of the contractual obligation grows. \nThe cost of equity also goes up because the magnitude of the senior claims on assets is higher, making the \nreturn on the residual claim riskier. But overall risk is preserved since debt is less costly than equity due to its \nseniority in the capital structure.  \nA simple illustration can help make the point. Assume a company that has $100 in annual operating profit. We \ncan observe what happens as we add debt to the capital structure. \n \nA \nB \nC \nOperating profit  \n$100 \n$100 \n$100 \nDebt \n0 \n200 \n400 \nCost of debt \n0.00% \n5.00% \n6.25% \nCash flow for equity \n100 \n90 \n75 \nEquity \n1,000 \n800 \n600 \nCost of equity \n10.00% \n11.25% \n12.50%  \nValue of the firm \n $1,000 \n$1,000 \n$1,000 \nIn scenario A, the firm is financed solely with equity that has a cost of 10 percent. Provided the company will \nearn $100 into perpetuity with no growth, the value of the firm is $100 divided by 10 percent, or $1,000.  \nIn scenario B, the company issues $200 of debt at a cost of 5 percent. As a result, the cash flow for equity \nholders drops $10, from $100 to $90 ($10 = $200 \u00d7 5 percent). Shareholders now require a return of 11.25 \npercent because the addition of debt increases their risk. The debt is $200, the equity is now worth $800 ($800 \n= $90 \u00f7 11.25 percent), and the value of the firm remains $1,000 ($1,000 = $200 debt + $800 equity). \nIn scenario C, the company adds more debt, bringing the total to $400. The additional debt increases the risk \nfor debt holders. As a consequence, the cost of debt goes from 5 to 6.25 percent. The higher interest payment, \nnow $25 ($25 = $400 \u00d7 6.25 percent), means that only $75 is left over for equity holders. The risk for equity \nholders also rises, going from 11.25 to 12.5 percent. Here again, the cost of debt and equity are higher but the \nvalue of the firm does not change. The debt is worth $400 and the equity is valued at $600 ($600 = $75 \u00f7 12.5 \npercent), leaving the total at $1,000.  \n"

It also assumes markets are perfect and complete. \nSince none of these conditions prevail in the real world, we can conclude capital structure does matter.15   \nTo see why, we focus on the assumption of no taxes. Many tax codes, including that of the U.S., treat some \npercentage of interest expense as a deduction from income before paying taxes. That means some debt adds \nvalue to the firm up to a point because more cash flow is going to stakeholders and less is going to the \ngovernment.  \nDebt\u2019s impact on the cost of capital is based on the role of taxes and other factors rather than on how a company \nslices and dices its capital structure. Further, too much debt is problematic because it introduces the risk of \nfinancial distress.   \nWe are about to roll up our sleeves and get into the details. But to summarize, the cost of capital is the opportunity \ncost of the investors who provide capital. It serves as a crucial link between corporate finance and investing, as \nit sets the minimum rate of return a company should be willing to accept to invest in its business.  \nRisk can be disaggregated into business risk, which reflects the volatility of a firm\u2019s cash flows, and financial \nrisk, how much debt the company takes on. M&M shows that capital structure does not matter under conditions \nthat are unrealistic. When we introduce realistic conditions, we can see that capital structure does matter and \nthat it affects the cost of capital.  \nSome investors prefer to discount cash flows at a required rate of return that reflects the minimum threshold of \nexpected return they want to earn. In cases when that rate of return exceeds the cost of capital, the approach is \nequivalent to discounting at the cost of capital and insisting on paying a price that is sufficiently less than value. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All rights reserved. \n6422586 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n9\n \nEstimating the Cost of Debt \nThe cost of debt is the effective after-tax rate a company has to pay on its long-term debt.  \nThe yield to maturity on a company\u2019s long-term, option-free bonds is a good estimate for the pre-tax cost of debt \nfor a company with securities that are rated as investment grade. This is debt that is deemed to have a relatively \nlow risk of default and hence receives a higher rating from the credit agencies (Baa or above from Moody\u2019s and \nBBB or above from S&P Global and Fitch). You can observe this rate directly for most firms. \nFor companies that have only short-term or illiquid debt, you can take some steps to estimate the cost of debt \nindirectly. First, determine the credit rating on the company\u2019s unsecured long-term debt. Second, look at the \naverage yield to maturity on a portfolio of bonds with a similar credit rating. Bond investors often express this as \na spread over a Treasury rate, usually the 10-year note. The treasury yield is a proxy for the risk-free rate.  \nIt is appropriate to use an option-adjusted spread (OAS) for a fixed income security that embeds options. For \nexample, a bond may include an option for the investor to sell it back to the issuer on a specific date at a set \nprice. Or the issuer may have the option to call back, or redeem, the bond at a predetermined time and price.  \nSome companies finance themselves predominantly with short-term debt. In this case, it may appear appropriate \nto use the short-term rates as the cost of debt, but the problem is that short-term rates do not reflect expectations \nabout long-term inflation. The time horizon for estimating the cost of capital should match the time horizon of \nforecasted cash flows, which is rarely less than ten years.  \nThe long-term rate is a better approximation of interest costs over time even for companies that roll over their \nshort-term debt because long-term rates capture the expected cost of repeated borrowing. If a company \nexclusively relies on short-term debt, use its credit rating to approximate the cost of long-term debt.  \nFree cash flow, or net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) less investment needs, does not reflect financial \nleverage. This is useful for comparing companies with different capital structures. But debt creates a valuable \ntax shield free cash flow does not capture because some of the interest expense is generally tax deductible.16  \nTo capture the value of the tax shield, you must adjust debt from a pre-tax rate to an after-tax rate. To do this, \nmultiply the pre-tax cost of debt by one minus the marginal tax rate. The marginal tax rate is the tax rate a \ncompany pays on its last dollar of taxable income. This is how the benefit of the tax shield that debt creates finds \nits way into the calculation of WACC. The formula is:  \nAfter-tax cost of debt = pre-tax cost of debt \u00d7 (1 \u2013 marginal tax rate)  \nNot all companies can take all of their interest expense as a deduction from taxes. For example, the Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act of 2017 sets a limit on the tax deductibility of interest at 30 percent of earnings before interest and \ntaxes (EBIT) for U.S. companies with sales of $25 million or more. This went into effect in 2022. We estimate \nthat this affected about 25 percent of the companies in the Russell 3000 that had positive EBIT in 2022. The \nRussell 3000 tracks the largest stocks by market capitalization in the United States.  \nThe effective rate is commonly lower than the marginal rate because companies have net operating losses \n(NOLs), tax loss carrybacks, or investment tax credits. \nThe cost of debt should reflect the marginal rate, including state and local taxes, of the countries where the \ncompany earns its operating profit. This can create a sizeable difference between the tax rate in a company\u2019s \nhome country and the tax rate it must actually pay for firms with a large presence outside of their domicile.  \n"

First, assume \nthe company pays normal taxes in its free cash flows. This, of course, will lead to a value that is too low.  \nSecond, calculate the present value of the tax savings. To do this, calculate the annual tax savings and discount \nthat savings at the cost of debt. Note that the company has to produce operating income to realize tax savings. \nAdd that amount back to the value of the firm assuming full tax payment. These two stages allow for \ncomparability to profitable peers and specify the value of the tax savings.  \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also changed the rules for NOLs. Prior to the act, companies could carry \nback NOLs for two years, carry them forward for 20 years, and offset all taxable income when carried back or \nforward. Starting in 2018, carrybacks were eliminated and companies are only allowed to use a net operating \nloss carryforward for up to 80 percent of taxable income. \nThe book value of debt is in many cases a sensible proxy for the market value of debt. But make an adjustment \nin your debt-to-total capital ratio if the debt is trading at a substantial premium or discount to par.  \nThe yield to maturity is a reasonable proxy for the pre-tax cost of debt for companies with debt that is rated as \ninvestment grade. That yield can be expressed as a spread over a risk-free rate. \nExhibit 3 shows a decomposition of expected returns, calculated monthly, for BBB bonds from 2008 to 2022. \nThe components of the expected return include the real yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, inflation \nexpectations, and the BBB credit spread. The nominal yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note equals the real \nyield plus inflation expectations. \nOver this time, the spread peaked at 7.8 percentage points in December 2008 during the financial crisis and \ntroughed at 1.1 percentage points in June 2021 in the throes of COVID.  \nExhibit 3: Expected Returns on BBB Bonds Calculated Monthly, 2008-2022 \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran; FRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Counterpoint Global. \nNote: August 2008-December 2022; Treasury note=10-year U.S. Treasury note; BBB spread=ICE BofA BBB U.S. corporate \nindex option-adjusted spread. \n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nPercent\nBBB Credit Spread\nInflation Expectations\nTreasury Note Real Yield\n"

For \nexample, the base rate of default over 10 years is about 2 percent for an investment-grade bond (BBB- or higher) \nand 23 percent for a speculative-grade bond (BB+ or lower).18 \nThe following equation is relevant for all bonds: \nCost of debt = promised yield spread \u2013 lost yield due to default \nThe cost of debt is somewhere between the promised yield and the risk-free rate. Because the lost yield due to \ndefault is negligible for companies that issue investment-grade bonds, the cost of debt and promised yield are \npractically equivalent. That means the yield to maturity is a suitable proxy for the cost of debt for companies that \nissue investment-grade bonds. \nThe lost yield due to default can be consequential for companies with non-investment grade ratings. As a \nconsequence, that yield to maturity may overstate materially the cost of debt. We will describe how to estimate \nthe lost yield due to default in a moment.  \nExhibit 4 shows a decomposition of expected returns, calculated monthly, for high-yield bonds from 2008 to \n2022.

All rights reserved. \n6422586 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n12\n \nRobert Merton, a professor of finance who was also accorded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, \ndeveloped a model that can provide insight into the risk of lost yield due to default.19 The model values the equity \nvalue of a company as a call option on its assets with a strike price equivalent to the notional value of the \nliabilities. The key is that the distribution of option values provides insight into the default probability.    \nIan Cooper and Sergei Davydenko, professors of finance, use the Merton model to estimate the lost yield due \nto default. Their inputs include the debt-to-total capital ratio, credit spread, equity risk premium, and volatility of \nthe equity. They estimate, for example, that the proportion of the debt spread attributable to lost yield due to \ndefault is 13 basis points, or 13 percent of the spread, for a firm with a 20 percent debt-to-total capital ratio, a \n100 basis point credit spread over AAA-rated bonds, an equity risk premium of 6 percent, and a volatility of \nequity of 30 percent. Accordingly, using the expected return results in a small error. \nThe picture is very different for a firm with high leverage. Assume a company has a 70 percent debt-to-total \ncapital ratio, a 400 basis point credit spread of AAA-rated bonds, an equity risk premium of 6 percent, and a \nvolatility of equity of 50 percent. The debt spread attributable to lost yield due to default rises to nearly 250 basis \npoints, or 62 percent of the spread. In this case, the promised yield spread greatly overstates the cost of debt.  \nLeases should also be considered debt. In 2019, new guidelines from the Financial Accounting Standards Board \n(FASB), which establishes U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), required most companies \nto reflect leases longer than one year on the balance sheet.20 Leases appear as a right-of-use asset on the asset \nside of the balance sheet. This captures the lessee\u2019s right to use the asset over the duration of the lease. About \nthree trillion dollars of leases were added to the balance sheets of U.S. companies as a result of this accounting \nchange.21  \nIn a quirk of accounting under GAAP, the entire lease payment, including embedded interest, is reflected in the \ncalculation of EBIT. With debt, the interest expense shows up below EBIT. As a result, a company that leases \nan asset will have lower EBIT than a company that finances the asset with debt, even though pre-tax income \nwill be the same. By contrast, lease payments are appropriately allocated between depreciation and interest \nexpense under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  \nTotal net debt should include leases and unfunded retirement benefits minus excess cash. Depending on the \nbusiness, you can treat cash and marketable securities above two to five percent of sales as excess.  \nFor example, Amazon, a multinational technology company, had long-term lease liabilities of $73.0 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2022. This liability was comprised of $11.4 billion in capital leases and $61.6 billion in operating \nleases. Total debt was $70.1 billion, including short-term debt of $3.0 billion and long-term debt of $67.1 billion. \nTotal lease liabilities plus debt equaled $143.1 billion. \nThe combination of cash and marketable securities was $70.0 billion, and sales for 2022 were $514 billion. \nAssuming the company requires 2 percent of sales to operate, excess cash was $59.7 billion ($59.7 = $70.0 \u2013 \n[$514 \u00d7 .02]). Total net debt was $83.4 billion ($83.4  = $73.0 in leases + $70.1 in debt - $59.7 in excess cash). \nThe company\u2019s equity value on that date was $860 billion ($860 = $84.00 stock price \u00d7 10.2 billion shares \noutstanding). \nEstimating the cost of debt is a reasonably straightforward process for most companies. The calculation is more \nchallenging for companies that have debt that is rated below investment grade or substantial leases or other \nliabilities.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n6422586 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n13\n \nEstimating the Cost of Equity \nThe cost of equity is the expected total return on a company\u2019s stock.  \nThe cost of equity is higher than the cost of debt because equity is a junior claim on the value of a firm. In \naddition, debt is an even cheaper source of financing because some percentage of the interest expense on debt \nis tax deductible. An estimate of the cost of equity should never be lower than that of debt. \nThe cost of equity is difficult to estimate because we cannot observe it directly. For example, when a company \nissues debt the cost is relatively transparent. The same company offering equity can only approximate the cost. \nAs a consequence, an estimate of the cost of equity requires an asset-pricing model.  \nThe best known of these are the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), developed by a handful of economists, \nincluding William Sharpe, and the three-factor model, advanced by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, \nprofessors of finance.22 Sharpe and Fama were also awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. \nAcademics have continued to add factors in an effort to explain returns more effectively than the CAPM or three-\nfactor model can. This has led to a \u201czoo\u201d of factors seeking to explain hundreds of purported anomalies.23  \nFinancial executives rely heavily on the CAPM but the investment community, led by quantitative funds, uses \nsix factors widely. These include beta (stocks of companies with high betas earn higher returns than those with \nlow betas), size (stocks of companies with small capitalizations generate higher returns than stocks of \ncompanies with large capitalizations),24 value (stocks with low multiples outperform those with high multiples),25 \nmomentum (stocks that have done well continue to do well in the short term),26 quality (companies of high quality \nprovide higher returns than companies of low quality),27 and asset growth (companies with low asset growth \noutperform those with high asset growth).28 \nFama and French now recommend a five-factor model that includes all of the factors above except for \nmomentum. We will focus on the CAPM because it is the model most practitioners use. See appendix B for a \ndiscussion of the three-factor model.  \nThe CAPM estimates the expected return of a security by adding the risk-free rate to the security\u2019s beta (\u03b2) times \nthe equity risk premium (ERP). The ERP equals the difference between the expected return for the market and \nthe risk-free rate and is similar conceptually to a credit spread.   \nExpected return = Risk-free rate + \u03b2(Market return \u2013 Risk-free rate)  \nThe ERP is the same for all stocks in the CAPM because it captures what is known as \u201csystematic risk,\u201d or risk \nthat cannot be diversified away. Beta measures how a company\u2019s risk contributes to portfolio risk. \u201cUnsystematic \nrisk\u201d can be reduced through portfolio diversification. \nExhibit 5 shows the security market line, which reflects a linear relationship between risk and reward. Beta \nmeasures how much a stock moves relative to a benchmark index. \n \n \n \n \n"

The best proxy for the risk-free rate is a yield on a long-term, default-free government fixed-\nincome security. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is appropriate for businesses based in the United \nStates. This yield is easy to find, is sufficiently long-dated, and has a relatively low risk of default.  \nOutside of the United States, you can adjust the government borrowing rate in local currencies by the estimated \ndefault spread. Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York \nUniversity, shares these estimates on his website based on local currency ratings.29 \nIdeally, the security that reflects the risk-free rate should have no covariance with the market, or a beta of zero. \nExhibit 6 shows that the 10-year Treasury note has a beta of 0.03 when compared to the S&P 500, an index \nthat tracks the stocks of 500 large companies in the U.S. These are monthly returns for the 60 months ending \nin December 2022.  \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity Market Line (SML)\nRate of Return\nRisk (Beta Coefficient)\nRisk-\nFree \nRate\n"

The ERP is the difference between the return of the equity market and the return of the \nrisk-free asset.30 The ERP is higher than credit spreads in general because equity is riskier than debt. Observing \nthe historical ERP is easy but estimating the premium going forward is a challenge. For example, one survey of \n150 finance and valuation textbooks that were written over 3 decades revealed a range of estimated ERPs from \n3 to 10 percent, and one-third of the books used different ERPs in various places within the same book.31  \nLeading academics and practitioners who convened a meeting in 2001 to discuss the ERP provided a range of \nestimates for the ERP at that time from 0 to 7 percent, with an average just under 4 percent.32 The realized ERP \nfor the following 10 years was minus 4.1 percent. \nDeterminants of the ERP include collective risk aversion, the perceived level of economic risk, the degree of \nliquidity in markets, and tax policy.33 The ERP moves around because these factors change. In fact, academic \nresearch suggests the ERP is probably a series that has unstable statistical properties.34 The practical objective \nis to come up with an intelligent forecast of the ERP to assess expected returns. \nThere are three common approaches to estimating the ERP. The first is to look at historical results and assume \nthe future will be similar to the past. The second is to survey investors about their expectations. The third is to \nestimate a rate the market implies by reverse-engineering assumptions to solve for the market price.  \nEach approach has its pros and cons. Historical results are supported by lots of data but are highly sensitive to \nthe time period selected, include survivorship bias, and are different whether calculated using arithmetic or \ngeometric averages.35  \nSurveys, which include forecasts by academics, financial executives, and individual and institutional investors, \nprovide snapshots of attitudes at a specific moment but are imperfect because of a strong tendency to \nextrapolate recent results.

Aswath Damodaran posts an updated estimate of the equity risk premium on his website \nevery month. He also shares a spreadsheet with his assumptions that offers the flexibility to change the variables. \nDamodaran has annual estimates for the equity risk premium going back to 1961. The range is from a low of 2.1 \npercent in 1999 to a high of 6.5 percent in 1979. The estimates are not adjusted for inflation. \nExhibit 7 shows the relationship between Damodaran\u2019s cost of equity estimates (x-axis) and the subsequent \ntotal returns for the S&P 500 over the following 10 years (y-axis). While not perfect, there is a distinct association \nbetween expected and realized returns.  \nWe find Damodaran\u2019s estimates to be sensible and note that FactSet uses his equity risk premium as the default \nin their calculations of the cost of capital.  \nExhibit 7: Cost of Equity and Future TSRs, S&P 500, 1961-2022 \n \nSource: FactSet; Aswath Damodaran; Counterpoint Global. \nWe ultimately want an ERP that looks forward, but understanding historical averages is helpful to place current \nconditions in context. Calculating the historical ERP might appear straightforward, but it requires judgment about \nthe appropriate risk-free rate, the time period over which to measure results, and the choice of an arithmetic or \ngeometric average. Damodaran finds that the historical ERP can fall in the range of 3 to 12 percent based on \nthe various combinations of alternatives.37  \nThe total return on the 10-year Treasury note works well as a proxy for the risk-free rate. Using returns from \nTreasury bills or bonds requires a commensurate adjustment to the ERP. \nThe issue of time horizon is thornier. The argument in favor of shorter time horizons is that they better capture \npresent conditions. The argument against a short time frame is that it may not accurately reflect the full \ndistribution of outcomes. An estimate\u2019s accuracy can be measured with the standard error, which is calculated \nas the observed standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.  \nIn plain words, using a small sample of a large distribution of outcomes increases the possibility that your \nestimate is wrong because you fail to capture a lot of relevant data.

That series includes more than 90 years, which \ngets the standard error down to about 2.0 percent (0.02 = 0.197 \u00f7 94^0.5). That the standard errors are as large \nor larger than the ERP for periods of fewer than 20 years supports the case for a longer time period.  \nHistorical averages to estimate the ERP can be calculated using arithmetic or geometric returns. The difference \nbetween the two is material. The arithmetic mean is the average of the annual ERPs (equity market - risk-free \nrate). The geometric mean is the compound annual rate of return. The geometric return is always less than or \nequal to the arithmetic return and can be approximated by taking one-half of the variance of returns. Variance is \nthe square of the standard deviation. \nThe difference between arithmetic and geometric returns grows as the standard deviation of the results in the \ntime series increases. For equity less bond returns in the U.S. from 1928-2022, the arithmetic return was 6.6 \npercent and the geometric mean was 5.1 percent. The difference, 1.5 percentage points, is a large percentage \nof the value of both totals. \nThe arithmetic average is appropriate if the objective is to estimate the equity risk premium over the next year. \nThe geometric average is proper over multiple time periods.  \nThe second approach is an estimate of the ERP implied by market prices. The idea is that the key drivers of \nvalue, including earnings and dividends, follow long-term trends that are somewhat predictable. With a sense of \nfuture cash flows and knowledge of the prevailing price, it is possible to solve for the discount rate that equates \nthe present value of future free cash flows to today\u2019s price. \nExhibit 8 shows the expected returns for the U.S. stock market from August 2008 through 2022 using the 10-\nyear Treasury note as the risk-free rate and Damodaran\u2019s estimate of the ERP.

From 1961 through about 2000, the ratio of the ERP to the risk-free \nyield was about 0.6, which means that the ERP was consistently below the risk-free rate.  \nThat ratio started rising following the dot-com bust, jumped after the financial crisis, and spiked to more than five \ntimes with the actions taken to deal with COVID. In 2022, the estimated ERP increased 170 basis points and \nthe yield on the risk-free rate rose 230 basis points, lowering the ratio between the ERP and risk-free rate to \nabout 1.5 times. The current ratio is in line with those in the 2000s, while still far from the average of 1961-1999. \nExhibit 9: Equity Risk Premium and the Risk-Free Rate, 1961-2022 \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran; FRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Data reflect end of year; Treasury note=10-year U.S. Treasury note. \nComparing the ERP to credit spreads is another way to assess whether it is calibrated sensibly. We can use \nexpected fixed income returns, which are observable, as a benchmark to estimate expected equity returns, \nwhich are unobservable.  \nThe ERP is higher than the credit spread because stocks are riskier than bonds. However, there have been \nperiods of very high valuations in the equity markets that implied low future equity returns.

Low \nspreads and volatility imply that investors are seeking risk, and high readings indicate fear of risky assets.  \nLow risk aversion translates into higher asset prices, holding constant the prospects for future cash flow. High \nasset prices are associated with less upside and more downside in equity returns. Asset prices are often \nvulnerable to decline when risk is perceived to be low. Examples include the spring of 2000, summer of 2007, \nand fall of 2021. Asset prices are often very attractive when risk appears to be high, as we saw in March 2009 \nand March 2020.     \nThe market places a price on other measures of risk that can be informative when considering the ERP. The \nsignals are strongest when the ERP, credit spreads, and VIX all indicate similar levels of extreme fear or greed.  \nBeta. Despite the CAPM\u2019s popularity among practitioners, the concept of beta has been challenged on empirical \nand intellectual grounds. The empirical problem is that beta does not predict expected returns the way it is meant \nto. Specifically, stocks with low betas generate higher returns, and stocks with high betas deliver lower returns, \nthan the model predicts. The intellectual objection is that volatility in general, and beta in particular, are poor \nways to measure risk. Value investors generally define risk as potential permanent loss of capital and argue that \nthe volatility of asset prices does a poor job of capturing that risk.   \nWe discuss methods to improve the measurement of beta and also review alternative approaches to estimating \nthe cost of equity. The objective is to come up with an estimate that captures the opportunity cost of equity \ninvestors in a portfolio setting and that makes business, economic, and common sense. \nBeta measures the return of an individual security relative to the return on the market index. It reflects financial \nelasticity. You calculate a historical beta by doing a regression analysis with the market\u2019s total returns as the \nindependent variable (x-axis) and the asset\u2019s total returns as the dependent variable (y-axis). The slope of the \nbest-fit line is the beta.40  \nThe slope of the regression line is the rise (up or down) over the run (left to right). The beta is 1.0 for a security \nthat goes up and down the same as the market. The beta is 2.0 for an asset that goes up or down at a percentage \ntwice that of the market. That asset is considered to be riskier than the market. The beta is 0.5 if the security \nrises and falls at a rate that is one-half of the market\u2019s percentage. That security is less risky than the market. \nExhibit 12 shows the beta for Nike, a sportswear company, using monthly returns over the 60 months ended \n2022, and the S&P 500 as the index. The beta is 1.09. The equation for the \u201cslope intercept form\u201d of a straight \nline is y = mx + b. In this equation, which appears in the top right corner of exhibit 12, \u201cm\u201d equals beta (slope) \nand \u201cb\u201d is alpha (intercept). Alpha is the y-intercept of a regression line and as such captures the excess return. \nIf you combine all of the assets in an index and correlate it versus the index itself, you will get a beta of 1.0 and \nan alpha of zero before consideration of any costs. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The benefit of going back further is that there are more data and \nthe regression result is more reliable as a result. The drawback is that the company may have changed its \nbusiness model, business mix, or levels of financial leverage. Or it may have simply matured.

The first method regresses the beta toward 1.0 to create an adjusted beta. Bloomberg and \nValue Line use this technique. Here\u2019s the formula that is commonly used: \nAdjusted beta = Raw beta (0.67) + 1.0 (0.33) \nSo, for example, Amazon\u2019s adjusted beta is 1.15 ([1.22*.67]) + [1.0*.33]). \nThe justification for this adjustment is the empirical evidence that betas tend toward 1.0 over time.42 This makes \neconomic and intuitive sense. The value of a company can be broken down into a steady-state value and the \npresent value of growth opportunities (PVGO).43 The steady-state value comes from assets in place and reflects \nthe cash flows the business currently generates. The PVGO reflects the expected value of future investments \nthat create value.  \nThe value of most companies is a combination of the two, and as a company matures the steady-state \ncontributes more to value and the PVGO adds less. Research shows that the investments in the PVGO are \nriskier than the assets in place. That means they have higher betas. As the mix of firm value shifts from PVGO \ntoward steady-state, the beta drifts lower.44    \nThis adjustment is reasonable but applying proper weights is a challenge. The rate at which betas converge to \n1.0 is different from one company to the next. But overall, some regression in the beta toward 1.0 generally \nimproves the estimate of a beta that seeks to reflect future risk.  \nAcknowledging that betas regress is especially important in calculating a continuing value. In a DCF model, the \ncontinuing value is an estimate of the value beyond the explicit forecast period. Healthy businesses tend to \nbecome larger, more profitable, and more stable as they mature. That means that the cost of capital used to \nestimate the continuing value should reflect the business characteristics in the future versus what they are today.  \nIndustry Beta. Another way to improve beta is to use an industry beta rather than the beta of an individual \ncompany. The economic rationale is that business risk, or variability of cash flows, will be similar for all \ncompanies within an industry. An industry beta can reduce error by using a larger sample, potentially cancelling \nthe noise that appears in the estimation of beta for individual companies.  \nThe calculation of an industry beta has three steps: \n1. Unlever the beta. A company\u2019s beta combines business risk and financial risk. We want to measure business \nrisk first, so we need to remove the effect of financial leverage from the beta. The equation to unlever the beta \nis based on M&M\u2019s invariance proposition:45 \n\u03b2U = \u03b2L/[1 + (1 \u2013 T) D/E)] \nWhere:  \n\u03b2U = Beta unlevered \n\u03b2L = Beta levered \nT  = Tax rate \nD = Market value of debt \nE = Market value of equity \n \n \n"

Calculate the average beta for the industry. The trick here is defining the industry. Ideally, it is a group of \ncompanies with similar business risk because they are exposed to the same markets, create comparable \nproducts, and deal with similar customers. The average can be weighted by market capitalization, and \ncalculating the median helps check for potential outliers that might distort the average. \n3. Relever the beta for the specific company. Unlevering the beta isolates business risk, which is considered \nuniform for companies within the same industry. We must now reintroduce financial risk, which can vary for \ncompanies within the same industry. Financial risk is estimated using a company\u2019s expected long-term capital \nstructure. The formula to relever the beta is: \n\u03b2L = \u03b2U [1 + (1 \u2013 T) D/E] \nTake for example a company that has an industry beta of 1.05, a 20 percent tax rate, and 25 percent debt and \n75 percent equity: \n\u03b2L = 1.05 [1 + (1 \u2013 .20) .25/.75)] \n \n= 1.05 [1 + .80(.333)] \n \n= 1.05 [1.267] \n\u03b2U = 1.33 \nThe motivation to calculate an industry beta is to come up with a more accurate and stable estimate of a \ncompany\u2019s risk. But there is not a great deal of evidence that industry betas are much better than firm-specific \nbetas as they face a lot of the same analytical issues.46 Further, many companies operate in multiple lines of \nbusiness and estimating the risk for each is cumbersome, even if it provides an improved estimate of beta.47 \nAswath Damodaran provides his estimates of levered and unlevered betas for dozens of industries and includes \na correction for industries with lots of cash. When cash exceeds debt, a company has negative financial risk. \nThis dampens the volatility of cash flows and lowers the risk for shareholders.  \nWinsorized Beta. Ivo Welch, a professor of finance, finds the predictive value of beta improves when past \nreturns are winsorized.48 Winsorizing removes extreme values in a data series to reduce the impact of non-\nrepresentative outliers. \nUsing daily returns, data are cut off at -2 times and +4 times the market\u2019s return. For instance, if the market\u2019s \nreturn on one day is +5 percent, the stock\u2019s returns are winsorized at -10 and +20 percent. If the market is down \n5 percent, the returns are winsorized at -20 to +10 percent. This process changes the slope of the regression \nand hence the beta. \nWelch finds that this modification produces a beta that better predicts future betas than does a simple regression \nor a regression combined with an adjustment. \n"

Assume an after-tax \ncost of debt of 5 percent and a cost of equity of 10 percent that is financed with 20 percent debt and 80 percent \nequity.

The reason is that \nopportunity cost is based on the prevailing asset price rather than the level at which the company reflects \ndebt or equity on the balance sheet. Indeed, some companies have negative equity as the result of the \nvagary of accounting.50   \nCompanies sometimes share a target for the debt-to-total capital ratio based on book values. In those \ninstances, you should translate the target into one based on market values. Most companies try to stay \nclose to their target capital structures. But use the target weights of debt and equity even if the current \nweights are different because you want the best estimate of what the capital structure will look like over \ntime. \nExhibit 17 shows the debt-to-total capital ratio for the Russell 3000 from 1985 to 2022. The 2022 figure \nwas 18 percent, below the 30 percent average over the full period. The decline in leverage levels since \n2008 notwithstanding, the trend in the U.S. over the last century has been to increase leverage.51 There \nis also evidence that companies adjust their capital structures in reaction to changes in tax rates.52 \nExhibit 17: Debt-to-Total Capital Ratio for the Russell 3000, 1985-2022 \n \nSource: FactSet and Counterpoint Global estimates. \nNote: Excludes financials and real estate; Capital structure reflects the book value of total long- and short-term debt and the \nmarket value of equity. \n \n\u2022 \nThe WACC is the discount rate a company should use for investments that have risk consistent with the \nunderlying business. Companies and investors sometimes evaluate the attractiveness of an investment \nusing the cost of funding rather than the cost of capital, especially in cases where the investment is \nexpected to add to earnings per share. This is incorrect.  \nHowever, the discount rate for an investment that is more or less risky than that of the company should \nbe higher or lower than the company\u2019s overall WACC to reflect that difference. Empirically, companies \ncommonly stick to one cost of capital, which introduces the risk of overinvesting in high-risk investments \nand underinvesting in low-risk investments.53   \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nPercent\nAverage \n"

All rights reserved. \n6422586 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n29\n \nOther Forms of Financing  \nDebt and equity are by far the largest sources of capital for U.S. public companies. As of the end of 2022, the \ntotal value of corporate debt and leases was about $10 trillion and the market value of equity was approximately \n$40 trillion. Companies use other forms of external financing as well, such as convertible debt and preferred \nstock. The size of the convertible debt market was $240 billion based on market value, and $250 billion based \non par value, in 2022. The value of preferred stocks in 2022 was roughly $310 billion for stocks listed on major \nexchanges, and $540 billion including stocks that trade over-the-counter (OTC). Federal National Mortgage \nAssociation and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, account \nfor nearly all of the OTC issuance.  \nConvertible Bonds. Convertible bonds combine a straight debt issue with a warrant. A warrant provides the \nowner with the right, but not the obligation, to buy the stock at a specified exercise price by a certain date. \nWarrants, unlike options, are for the issuance of new shares. That means that current shareholders are diluted \nif the convertible holders exercise the warrants. In the calculation of a company\u2019s capital structure, the bond \nportion is debt and the warrant is equity.  \nConvertible bonds generally have a lower yield than straight debt because the attached warrant has value. Many \nissuers of convertible bonds have relatively high equity volatility. This makes sense because volatility is a large \ndriver of warrant value. It is common for convertible bonds to be junior to other debt in the capital structure.  \nThe market value of convertible bonds falls into one of three broad regimes. The first is when the stock price is \nwell above the exercise price. Here, convertible bonds trade more like straight equity than debt. Second, when \nthe stock price is close to the exercise price the bond value and warrant are both meaningful sources of value. \nFinally, when the stock price falls well below the exercise price the convertible bond is \u201cbusted,\u201d and trades at a \nyield similar to straight debt.  \nWhen the stock price is close to the strike price it is vital to value the debt and warrant properly. To value the \nstraight bond, you proceed as if warrant does not exist. You apply the rate of interest the company would need \nto pay if it had issued a straight bond. The warrant can be valued using a standard warrant pricing model. The \nimplied volatility of the stock is a key input. Then you add the debt and warrant values to estimate the value of \nthe convertible bond.  \nPreferred Stock. Preferred stock is an equity instrument that combines the features of debt and equity. Similar \nto debt, preferred stock typically provides its holder a stream of cash flows in the form of a dividend. Preferred \nstock, similar to debt, generally has no voting rights. Like equity, the company has no contractual obligation to \npay a dividend on preferred stock and the board of directors has discretion in setting the preferred dividend. But \ncompanies have to pay the specified dividends on preferred stock before they pay dividends on common stock. \nPreferred stock is junior to debt but senior to common equity in the capital structure. As a result, the cost of \npreferred stock is typically somewhere in between the two. Preferred stock also has a senior claim to common \nequity in liquidation. The cost of preferred stock equals the preferred dividend per share divided by the market \nprice per share. For example, cost of preferred stock is 8.75 percent for an issue paying a dividend of $1.75 per \nyear and a price of $20 (8.75 = $1.75 \u00f7 $20). \nUnlike most interest payments on debt, dividends on preferred stock are not tax deductible for the issuing firm. \nThis deters a lot of companies from issuing preferred stock. The largest issuers are financial institutions, real \nestate investment trusts (REITs), and public utilities.  \n"

Specifically, equity is subject to \ntaxation at the corporate and individual levels. Individuals must pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in taxable \naccounts. In fact, share buybacks, another means to return cash to shareholders, are subject to triple taxation \nin the U.S. following the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which introduced a one percent excise tax on buybacks. \nMost countries treat some percentage of interest expense as a cost of doing business that a company may \ndeduct from income before paying taxes. This avoids the problem of double taxation. As a result, debt financing \nis sensible for many companies because it increases the value of the firm by making additional cash flow \navailable for the providers of capital. \nSome debt may add value but it stands to reason that too much debt introduces the risk of financial distress. \nThe question is how companies actually behave relative to what might be assessed as ideal.  \nSurveys of financial executives reveal some interesting evidence. First, companies generally adopt a target \ncapital structure with debt less than the optimal amount because they want to ensure sufficient resilience. \nFurther, a relatively recent survey found that only 24 percent of the chief financial officers of large corporations \ncited interest deductibility as an important factor in determining debt levels.  \nThis result, which is down from 60 percent in a comparable survey from 2001, suggests that that the value of \nthe tax shield is not the guiding factor in setting a target capital structure. That said, federal tax rates and interest \nrates are lower today than they were at the beginning of this century.57  \nThere are a couple of popular approaches to studying capital structure. \nTrade-Off Theory. This theory says the optimal capital structure is the ideal trade-off between the benefit of \ninterest tax shields and the cost of financial distress (see exhibit 18). When there is no debt, you can value the \nfirm using an estimate of the cost of equity and an unlevered beta. As a company adds debt (moving to the right \non the x-axis), the benefit of the tax shield initially rises at a rate faster than the cost of financial distress.  \nExhibit 18: Trade-Off Theory of Optimal Capital Structure \n \nSource: Based on Stewart C. Myers, \u201cThe Capital Structure Puzzle,\u201d Journal of Finance, Vol. 39, No. 3, July 1984, 575-592. \nInterest tax \nshield minus \ncost of financial \ndistress  \nMarket \nValue of \nFirm\nOptimum\nDebt\nValue with all-equity financing\n"

One way to think about it is that interest expense becomes a fixed cost, and therefore \ndeclines in operating profit create pre-tax losses. A company must pay taxes for the tax shield to be of value. \nAdding debt therefore increases the probability that a company will be unprofitable and unable to benefit from \ntax shields.    \nWe already saw that many companies have a target capital structure that is more conservative than what the \ntrade-off theory would advise. Yet some high level data advise the concept is useful. \nFor example, the theory proposes that businesses with low business risk are good candidates to use debt. \nBusiness risk reflects the volatility of operating profits and is measured with unlevered beta. The use of debt can \nbe quantified with the ratio of debt to total capital. Aswath Damodaran provides these data. Exhibit 19 shows the \nrelationship between unlevered beta and the ratio of debt to total capital for more than 90 industries using \nDamodaran\u2019s figures. As the theory predicts, companies with low business risk tend to have higher debt-to-total \ncapital ratios than businesses with high business risk.  \nExhibit 19: Unlevered Beta and Debt-to-Total Capital Ratios by Industry \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran and Counterpoint Global. \nThe trade-off theory also helps explain the rise of the leveraged buyout industry in recent decades. A leveraged \nbuyout is a transaction where a financial sponsor buys a company that has solid and stable cash flows and \nfinances the deal with a high ratio of debt to equity. The framework also explains why companies raise equity \nwhen financial distress increases and why companies beyond the optimal debt-to-total capital ratio can add \nvalue by paying down debt.58 \nBut the theory fails to explain other facts, including why capital structures vary substantially within industries and \nwhy companies are not proactive in changing their policies to reflect the drivers of the theory, including changes \nin the cost associated with financial distress as well as changes in interest and tax rates. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nDebt-to-Total Capital (Percent)\nUnlevered Beta\n"

Companies finance their operations internally through cash from operations or externally \nby raising debt or equity. This theory assumes that companies prefer internal finance, but if those funds are \ninsufficient firms will raise capital following a pecking order from the least to most risky capital.59 Specifically, \nthey will start with internal financing, followed by debt, and finally with equity. Capital structure decisions are not \nmotivated by the value of the tax shields but are related to the economics of the business. \nA company can rely on internal financing when its growth rate is equal to or lower than its return on invested \ncapital (ROIC). This allows us to test the pecking order theory because, holding growth constant, we should see \nbusinesses with high ROICs have lower debt-to-total capital ratios than businesses with low ROICs. \nExhibit 20 again uses Damodaran\u2019s data to examine this relationship for more than 90 industries. While far from \nperfect, the basic pattern holds true. Indeed, many of the best businesses in the world, as measured by ROIC, \nhave very conservative capital structures.  \nExhibit 20: Industry ROIC and Debt-to-Total Capital Ratio \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran and Counterpoint Global. \nThese theories particularly apply to companies that have capital structures that are expected to remain roughly \nstatic. Valuing dynamic capital structures requires a tool such as adjusted present value (see appendix A).  \nHere are some final thoughts that are more speculative. One way to think about the impact of taxes on the cost \nof capital is to consider the government as a stakeholder. Use of debt lowers the value of the government\u2019s claim \non cash flows and increases the value to debt and equity holders.   \nIn the U.S., corporate taxes as a percentage of total federal revenue have drifted lower from a peak of nearly 40 \npercent in 1943 to 9 percent today (see exhibit 21).

It \nallows us to estimate values in the future via compounding and bring future values to the present via discounting. \nYou can think of it as a form of opportunity cost.  \nPinpointing the cost of capital is a challenge because while most practitioners agree on the theoretical framework \nthere is wide discretion in how it is applied. As a result, the output can vary widely.61 Combine this with the fact \nthat the inputs move around and it is easy to see why many investors throw up their hands in frustration. \nOur view is a little more optimistic. The main idea to remember is that we are trying to estimate a discount rate \nthat is sound and that makes business and common sense. To that end, we can use risks that are priced by the \nmarket to guide our judgment.  \nThe cost of debt is relatively straightforward to calculate because the terms of borrowing are set by contract and \nrequired yields are visible. This is particularly true for debt rated as investment grade. For debt rated below \ninvestment grade the task is more challenging because of the risk of default and uncertainty of what creditors \nmay recover in that case. \nThe cost of equity is difficult to estimate because it has an implicit cost. In other words, investors expect a certain \nrate of return even if it is not spelled out explicitly. The two main hurdles in estimating the cost of equity properly \nare an estimate of the equity risk premium, the excess compensation over time for owning equities relative to a \nrisk-free asset, and the contribution of a firm\u2019s risk to a portfolio. \nWe find the estimates for the ERP that Aswath Damodaran produces every month to be a sound starting point. \nFurther, Damodaran provides a spreadsheet that allows an investor to use his or her assumptions and to modify \nthem to taste. The relationship between his ERPs and subsequent returns for the market over 10 years are \nreasonable.  \nHow a stock affects the risk of a portfolio, which beta seeks to measure, is more difficult and controversial. We \nreviewed techniques such a regression toward the mean, use of industry betas, and winsorizing betas, in order \nto reduce the noise. Applying these techniques intelligently requires addressing important considerations that in \nthemselves may be a valuable exercise. There is no question that some judgment is required. \nThe cost of capital is the rate at which future free cash flows are discounted to come up with a present value in \na discounted cash flow model. It is important to derive a figure that reflects prevailing market conditions and is \nsensible.  \nAt the end of the day, successful investing is based on understanding the market\u2019s expectations for future cash \nflows and anticipating how those expectations will change. The biggest driver is the revision of expectations in \nthe fundamentals of a company. These includes sales growth and potential, profitability, return on invested \ncapital, and sustainable competitive advantage.  \nDeriving a practical cost of capital is essential but not as important as understanding a business and its \nprospects. A solid cost of capital estimate is the price of entrance to the main event of anticipating revisions in \nexpectations for future cash flows.   \n \n \n"

Further, companies are \ntoday holding more cash than they did in the past. But additional analysis is required in cases where the capital \nstructure is likely to change materially over the forecast period. For example, APV has proven useful to value \ncompanies that are subject to a buyout by a private equity firm.63  \nAn APV analysis has four steps. First, you prepare forecasts for financial statements, including the income \nstatement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. This allows you to calculate free cash flow, the cash the \nbusiness generates excluding any impact from financing decisions. Free cash flow equals net operating profit \nafter taxes minus investment needs. Second, you discount the free cash flows at the cost of equity using an \nunlevered beta. Third, you value the effect of the tax shield at the cost of debt and, finally, you add the unlevered \nvalue to the value of the tax shield to estimate corporate value. \nHere is a very simple example:   \n1. Prepare forecasts for financial statements. We assume sales of $15,000 in year 1, sales growth of 5 \npercent, an earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) margin of 15 percent, net working capital \n(nwc) growth equal to 15 percent of incremental sales, fixed capital (fc) growth equal to 20 percent of incremental \nsales, and a 25 percent tax rate. \nThese assumptions solve for $2,000 of free cash flow (FCF) in year 1, and free cash flow grows 5 percent a \nyear through year 10.  \nWe also assume debt starts at $7,500 in year 1 and that $500 gets paid off each year for the following 9 years. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nSales \n15,000 \n15,750 \n16,538 \n17,364 \n18,233 \n19,144 \n20,101 \n21,107 \n22,162 \n23,270 \nEBITA \n3,000 \n3,150 \n3,308 \n3,473 \n3,647 \n3,829 \n4,020 \n4,221 \n4,432 \n4,654 \nCash taxes \n750 \n788 \n827 \n868 \n912 \n957 \n1,005 \n1,055 \n1,108 \n1,163 \nNOPAT \n2,250 \n2,363 \n2,481 \n2,605 \n2,735 \n2,872 \n3,015 \n3,166 \n3,324 \n3,490 \n\u0394 nwc \n107 \n113 \n118 \n124 \n130 \n137 \n144 \n151 \n158 \n166 \n\u0394 fc \n143 \n150 \n158 \n165 \n174 \n182 \n191 \n201 \n211 \n222 \nInvestment \n250 \n263 \n276 \n289 \n304 \n319 \n335 \n352 \n369 \n388 \nNOPAT \n2,250 \n2,363 \n2,481 \n2,605 \n2,735 \n2,872 \n3,015 \n3,166 \n3,324 \n3,490 \nInvestment \n250 \n263 \n276 \n289 \n304 \n319 \n335 \n352 \n369 \n388 \nFree cash flow \n2,000 \n2,100 \n2,205 \n2,315 \n2,431 \n2,553 \n2,680 \n2,814 \n2,955 \n3,103 \nDebt \n7,500 \n7,000 \n6,500 \n6,000 \n5,500 \n5,000 \n4,500 \n4,000 \n3,500 \n3,000 \n2.

Specifically, they found that small capitalization companies deliver higher returns \nthan large capitalization companies (small minus big, or SMB) and that cheap, high book-to-price stocks deliver \nhigher returns than expensive, low book-to-price stocks (high minus low, or HML). Note that these returns are \nrelative to what the CAPM predicts by itself. \nThe equation to estimate expected returns is as follows: \nReturn = \u03b1 + \u03b21(Rm \u2013 Rf) + \u03b22(RS \u2013 RB) + \u03b23(RH \u2013 RL) + \u03b5  \nFama and French tested their model using a rational asset-pricing framework. They assumed that small stocks \nmust be riskier than large stocks and that cheap stocks are riskier than expensive stocks. However, the case is \nnot clear cut for either based on first principles.  \nExhibit 24 shows the cost of equity for Nike using the Fama-French model. We use the U.S. 10-year Treasury \nnote for the risk-free rate. The result, 8.6 percent, is lower than the cost of equity of 10.3 percent derived from \nthe CAPM (10.3 = 3.9 + 1.09[9.8 \u2013 3.9]).  \nExhibit 24: Fama-French Three-Factor Cost of Equity for Nike \nFactor \nAverage annual \npremium \nRegression \nbeta \nContribution to \nexpected return \nEquity risk premium \n5.9% \n 1.08 \n 6.4% \nSMB premium \n2.3% \n-0.16 \n-0.4% \nHML premium \n4.3% \n-0.30 \n-1.3% \nPremium over risk-free rate \n 4.8% \nRisk-free rate \n 3.9% \nCost of equity \n 8.6% \nSource: Kenneth R. French; Aswath Damodaran; Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Monthly data over the 60 months ended 2022. \nNote that the beta associated with the market risk premium, or CAPM, is the most significant factor determining \nthe premium over the risk-free rate. As for the size and value premiums, the question is not whether the stock is \nsmall or cheap but rather how it acts relative to small and cheap stocks.  \nA multi-factor model will naturally outperform the CAPM looking back. Fama and French selected those factors \nas proxies for risk because they better explained returns. The challenge is to find risk factors that are causal and \nnot simply correlated.  \nJust as with the basic CAPM, the practical difficulties in using the multi-factor model include the choice of time \nhorizon and frequency of measurement period. Small stocks have delivered higher returns than large stocks and \ncheap stocks have outperformed expensive ones over long time periods. But there are extended stretches where \nthese relationships do not hold.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n6422586 Exp. 2/28/2025 \n42\n \nDefinitions of Terms \nHere are some definitions of the terms that many investors and executives use when discussing opportunity \ncost:  \nWeighted average cost of capital: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) blends the opportunity cost \nof the sources of capital with the relative contribution of those sources. The cost of capital is the rate at which \nyou discount future cash flows in order to determine the value today. \nDiscount rate: In finance, the discount rate is generally equivalent to the cost of capital. But companies often \nuse a discount rate that is substantially above the cost of capital.  \nFurther, the discount rate can be specified. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nrequires energy companies to use PV-10, which defines the value of reserves as the present value of the \nestimated future oil and gas revenues, less direct expenses, discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent. The \nterm can also be used as a proxy for the required rate of return (see below) from the point of view of the company.           \nCapitalization (Cap) rate: Typically used in real estate, the cap rate is the discount rate at which net operating \nincome (income minus all expenses) is capitalized to come up with a value for a building. For example, if the net \noperating income is $100 and the cap rate is 5 percent, the building is worth $2,000 ($100/.05). The cap rate \nworks best when net operating income is at a steady state.   \nInternal rate of return (IRR): Internal rate of return is the annualized effective compound rate of return that sets \nthe net present value of all cash flows in and out of an investment to zero. Generally speaking, when the IRR is \nin excess of the cost of capital for a project, the company should proceed with the project. \nIRR has a lot of quirks. For example, the IRR is the assumed reinvestment rate for cash flows. That means that \na high IRR implies a company can reinvest its cash flows at an unrealistically high level.  \nOne solution is to use the modified internal rate of return (MIRR), which calculates the future value of cash flows \nusing the reinvestment rate and the present value of the cash outflows using the financing rate.67 \nRequired rate of return: This is typically considered at the fund level. A portfolio may have a minimum threshold \nof expected return, after consideration for risk, that it must meet to make an investment.  \nYou can use the required rate of return in lieu of the weighted average cost of capital to see if the investment \nmeets your investment hurdle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Another consideration is that the expected return is on average higher than the implied cost of \ncapital. One simple way to appreciate this is that expected returns vary (i.e., are stochastic). Expected return is \ncommonly expressed as an arithmetic average and implied cost of capital as a geometric average. The \ngeometric average is lower than the arithmetic average if there is variance in the series.

It is akin to credit spreads in fixed income. The equity risk premium \nrelates to the expected returns of individual stocks in excess of the risk-free rate.
