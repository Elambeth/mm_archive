Cash balances are high, debt levels are \nlow, and free cash flow has never been stronger. Delivering superior shareholder returns in \nupcoming years may require companies to show the same savviness in capital markets as they \ndo in product markets. \n \nHow did we get to this situation? The events of this century\u2019s first six years encouraged \ncompanies to focus internally, leading to today\u2019s financial position. These include a brutal three-\nyear bear market in equities (2000-2002), a number of high-profile corporate scandals, terrorism, \na tight U.S. presidential election, heightened perceived geopolitical risk, a recession, and \nincreased regulation. Companies responded by honing their operations, limiting capital spending, \nhiring sparingly, and hoarding capital. A recent report noted that companies in major economies \nwent from using over $500 billion in capital to fund their operations in 2000 to generating close to \n$600 billion in free cash flow in 2004, nearly a $1.1 trillion swing in just four years. 1 \n \nThe statistics today are impressive. Returns on capital, by any measure, are at or near all-time \npeaks. (See Exhibit 1.) Industrial companies in the S&P 500 sat on a cash pile of over $600 billion \nas of late 2005. Free cash flow margins (free cash flow divided by sales) are close to all-time \nhighs, capital spending as a percentage of gross cash flow remains near fifty-year lows, and total \ndebt as a percentage of assets pushes at a record low. This all occurs against a backdrop of \nsharp productivity gains and stable and solid economic growth. 2 While investors may fret about \nthe fiscal health of the government or the consumer, companies are in great shape. \n \nExhibit 1: Return on Equity for the S&P 500 (1946-2005E) \n \n \n5\n10\n15\n20\n1946\n1950\n1954\n1958\n1962\n1966\n1970\n1974\n1978\n1982\n1986\n1990\n1994\n1998\n2002\nYear\nPercent\n \nSource: Corporate reports, Empirical Research Partners, LMCM estimates. \n \nAs a specific example, take the seventy-eight technology companies in the S&P 500. Barron\u2019s \nrecently calculated that these companies held $140 billion in net cash, about 7 percent of their \naggregate market capitalization. 3 Adopting a 20 percent debt-to-total capital ratio would allow \nthese companies to spend almost $450 billion on some combination of capital investments, \nacquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. Appendix A argues corporate America\u2019s strong financial \nposition may continue for some time.  \n \nSo what will American companies do with this excess cash? Simplistically, companies have two \nalternatives for deploying capital: invest via capital spending, working capital, mergers and \nacquisitions or return capital to the business owners through dividends and share buybacks. (See \nExhibit 2.) While capital deployment is ultimately senior management\u2019s most important task, many \ncompanies and investors fail to think clearly about how to best allocate capital systematically over \nthe long term. 4  \n \n"

Indeed, as agents for the owners rather than large shareholders themselves, \nmanagements often have an incentive to expand the business versus giving cash back to \nshareholders. In reality, very few executives and corporate boards consider returning capital to \nthe owners part of doing business. \n \nThis implicit bias fails to consider the crucial point that shareholders can reinvest the cash they \nreceive into other companies or projects, often earning a higher return than the company can. \nWhile management\u2019s opportunity set is practically limited to the company\u2019s business or industry, \nshareholders do not have the same constraint. Ironically, the investment opportunity management \nshould be most capable of valuing properly, the company\u2019s stock, is often dismissed in favor of \nharder-to-assess external investment opportunities. \n \nDividends and Buybacks: Two Ways to Return Cash to Shareholders \n \nCompanies choosing to return cash to shareholders can either pay a cash dividend or repurchase \nshares. Exhibit 3 shows the data for buybacks and dividends for the past 30 years or so. Since no \nunified approach to collecting these data exists, various sources provide differing sums. \nNotwithstanding this qualification, the data reveal a few important points: \n \n\u2022 \nBuybacks took off in the mid-1980s. In 1982, Congress enacted rule 10b-18, which \nprovided companies with a safe harbor, or a legal shield from the threat of being sued, for \nthe first time. This rule made large-scale buybacks viable for the first time in modern \nhistory. Any comparisons between the ratio of dividends to buybacks before and after \n1982 appear misleading. \n \n\u2022 \nThe value of buybacks exceeded dividends for the first time in the late 1990s. Companies \nhave consistently returned more capital to shareholders via share buybacks than \ndividends in recent years. Notably, the buyback numbers are heavily skewed: a small \npercentage of the companies represent a meaningful percentage of the total. That \nbuybacks exceed dividends calls into question simple measures like dividend yield.  \n \n\u2022 \nDividends, while losing relative importance, continue to grow. While the propensity to \nreturn cash has shifted toward buybacks, the total dividends companies pay are still \nincreasing. This stable, albeit modest, growth points to some important psychological \nfactors behind dividends.  \n \nCapital allocation \nalternatives\nReturn cash to \nclaimholders\nBusiness\nDividends\nShare buybacks\nDebt repayment\nCapital expenditures \nWorking capital\nMergers/acquisitions\n"

In the early part of the 21st century, dividends gained relative \nground versus buybacks for the first time in recent memory.

Appendix B shows this equivalence in \ndetail.  \n \nNaturally, the laboratory conditions we impose on the model differ from the real world. Leaving \naside the power of signals for a moment, evidence suggests that buybacks are a more efficient \nmeans of returning cash to shareholders for the following reasons: \n \n\u2022 \nTax differential. In May 2003, President George Bush signed legislation that, in part, \nlowered the maximum tax rate of dividends from 38 percent to 15 percent. While the \npermanence of this tax rate is still unclear, taxes on dividends and capital gains are \nequivalent for now. This equivalence obscures a benefit of buybacks: investors who elect \nto sell a portion of their holdings, creating a yield similar to a dividend, only pay taxes on \n"

In contrast, the full amount of a \ndividend is taxable. \n \n\u2022 \nTime is on your side. Deferral provides buybacks with another tax advantage. \nShareholders can choose to retain rather than sell their stock and hence defer tax \npayments until they sell. In this case, the benefit equals the time value of money. \n \n\u2022 \nShareholder discretion? With a dividend, the discretion lies with the firm. All \nshareholders receive the dividend and must deal with redeployment and tax \nconsequences. In contrast, a share repurchase gives more discretion to the \nshareholders. Shareholders can opt in or out based on their tax situation, cost basis, \nthe timing of their cash needs, and their company valuation.  \n \nFor example, assume a shareholder believes a stock they own is undervalued (a \nlikely condition). A dividend affects all shareholders the same way. But if the \ncompany buys back stock, the shareholder who decides not to sell ends up with a \nhigher percentage stake in a more valuable company, provided the stock proves to \nbe undervalued. \n \nDespite this theoretical equivalence, corporate executives think about dividends and buybacks \nvery differently. Executives generally consider maintaining the dividend to be on par with \ninvestment decisions, while having significant aversion to dividend cuts. In contrast, they perceive \nthe buyback as a residual that follows investment and dividend commitments.  \n \nSimilarly, executives deem buybacks much more flexible than dividends, reinforcing the sense \nthat dividends are a quasi-contract while buybacks are more discretionary. Finally, even though \ncorporate finance relies heavily on the role of taxes in judging the relative virtue of dividends \nversus buybacks, surveys of executives suggest taxes are a second-order concern in setting \npayout policy. 7 We find a substantial gap between the theory and practice in how companies \nreturn capital to shareholders. \n \nThe Golden Rule of Share Buybacks \n \nWe can define a principle to serve as a universal yardstick for judging the rationale and \nattractiveness of a buyback program: 8 \n \nA company should repurchase its shares only when its stock is trading below its expected \nvalue and when no better investment opportunities are available.  \n \nThe first part of this principle\u2014\u201ca company should repurchase its shares only when its stock is \ntrading below its expected value\u201d\u2014suggests management should act as a good investor by \nbuying the stock when the price is below the value. Objective, analytical managers likely \nunderstand the business and its prospects better than outsiders, positioning them well to make \nthis value-versus-price judgment. If price is truly below value, a buyback transfers wealth from \nselling shareholders to continuing shareholders. The resulting increase in expected value per \nshare holds with management\u2019s objective to maximize shareholder value for its continuing \nshareholders.  \n \nThe principle\u2019s second part, \u201cno better investment opportunities are available,\u201d addresses a \ncompany\u2019s priorities. Buybacks may appear attractive, but reinvesting in the business may \nprovide a better opportunity. Value-maximizing companies fund the highest return opportunities \nfirst. \n \nThe principle also has a couple of noteworthy corollaries.  \n \nFirst, the rate of return on a buyback depends on how deeply the market undervalues the stock. If \na company buys back undervalued shares, continuing shareholders earn a return in excess of the \n"

For instance, say a company has an 8 percent cost of equity and the \nstock is trading at 80 percent of expected value. Dividing 8 percent by 80 percent yields a 10 \npercent expected return for continuing shareholders. (See Exhibit 4.) Managers can compare this \nrate of return with alternative uses of capital. Alternatively, a buyback of undervalued shares \nserves to increase the per-share value of the remaining shares. Appendix C walks through this \nanalysis in detail. \n \nExhibit 4: Rate of Return on a Stock Buyback \n \nPrice-to-value ratio\n0.60\n           \n0.80\n           \n1.00\n           \n1.20\n           \n7%\n11.7%\n8.8%\n7.0%\n5.8%\nCost\n8%\n13.3%\n10.0%\n8.0%\n6.7%\nof \n9%\n15.0%\n11.3%\n9.0%\n7.5%\nequity\n10%\n16.7%\n12.5%\n10.0%\n8.3%\n11%\n18.3%\n13.8%\n11.0%\n9.2%  \n \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n \nSecond, a buyback can be more attractive than an investment in the business. Properly-oriented \nmanagers recognize they should fund all investments that promise to create value. But what if a \ncompany has no excess cash or borrowing capacity and hence must partially or wholly forgo a \nvalue-creating investment in the business to repurchase shares? A company should consider the \nbuyback when it provides a more attractive return than investing in the business. In reality, very \nfew managers think this way.  \n \nArmed with a means for assessing management\u2019s share-buyback decision, we can take a look at \nthe popular motivations for buying back stock. As we will see, management motivations are often \nfar from pure and are flatly misguided in numerous instances.  \n    \nThe Motivations for Share Buybacks \n \nSince 2000, over three-quarters of the companies in the S&P 500 have bought back stock. We \nnow look at the four primary reasons companies cite for buying back their stock: signaling the \nshares are undervalued, managing earnings per share, offsetting dilution from option programs, \nand increasing financial leverage. Specifically we seek to distinguish between decisions that \nbenefit continuing shareholders and those that potentially harm shareholders.  \n \n1. \nTo Signal to the Market the Shares are Undervalued \n \nThough managers most often cite signaling as their primary motivation, 9 the signal from \nbuybacks has weakened over the years. Why?  \n \nFirst, managers have historically done a poor job of following through on buyback \nannouncements, although they have improved in recent years. In the 1980s, for example, \ncompanies failed to complete 25 percent of authorized open-market buyback programs within \nthree years of announcement. 10 Managers in general are not as committed to executing buyback \nprograms as they are to paying dividends. \n \nAnother reason the signal has weakened over the past 20 years relates to the methods \ncompanies use to buy back their shares: \n \n\u2022 \nOpen-market purchases. In this method, the most widely used by far, companies simply \npurchase their own shares in the open market like any other investor. Although open-\nmarket purchases have legal restrictions, this method offers the greatest degree of \n"

    {

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nPage 7 \n \nflexibility. On the other hand, open-market purchases convey the weakest signal of \nmanagement conviction, particularly when made solely to offset dilution from options. \n \n\u2022 \nDutch auction. In a Dutch auction, management defines the number of shares it intends \nto buy, an expiration date, and a price range within which it is willing to buy (generally a \npremium to the market). 11 Shareholders may tender their shares at any price within the \nrange. Starting at the bottom of the range, the company sums the cumulative number of \nshares necessary to satisfy the program. All tendering shareholders at or below the \nclearing price receive the clearing price for their stock. Dutch auctions generally send \nstrong signals, and management can execute them relatively efficiently. 12   \n \n\u2022 \nFixed-price tender offers. With this method, management offers to repurchase a set \nnumber of shares at a fixed price through an expiration date. The price is often a \nsignificant premium to the market, and companies generally tender for a sizable \npercentage of the shares outstanding. Shareholders may or may not elect to tender their \nshares. Fixed-price tenders, especially debt-financed ones, tend to be powerful, positive \nsignals to the market. \n \n\u2022 \nPrivately negotiated purchases. In this case, the company strikes a deal with a single \nshareholder. In the 1980s, some companies purchased positions from investors or \ncompanies threatening a takeover. However, such greenmail transactions represent less \nthan 10 percent of privately negotiated buybacks in the past 20 years. This type of \nbuyback remains relatively rare.  \n \nIn recent years we have also seen an increase in accelerated share repurchase programs. Here, \na company purchases shares from an investment bank, allowing the company to retire a large \nblock of shares immediately. Simultaneously, the company enters into a forward contract with the \ninvestment bank, agreeing to pay the average market price of the shares the bank repurchases \nover a specified period, typically six to nine months.  \n \nAt the end of the period, there is net settlement between the parties; the company pays the \ninvestment bank\u2014or gets credited\u2014the difference between the initial and average share buyback \nprice. The bank pays the company the time value of the funds, less dividends. Companies \nutilizing accelerated share repurchase programs in 2005 include DuPont, Sara Lee, Hewlett-\nPackard, and Duke Energy. \n \nOpen-market purchases emit the weakest signal, whereas Dutch auctions and fixed-price tenders \ntend to convey much stronger signals. In the 1980s, Dutch auctions and fixed-price tenders \nrepresented about 22 percent of buyback volume in the U.S. In the 1990s, however, they \nconstituted only 4 percent of the total. Consequently, the number of strong-signal announcements \nhas fallen sharply. (See Exhibit 5.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nPage 10 \n \nNevertheless, managements persist in their efforts to maximize earnings per share\u2014sometimes, \nwe will see, at the expense of maximizing value. Why? First, they often believe the investment \ncommunity mechanically and uncritically applies a multiple to current earnings to establish value. \n(As disturbing, many investors believe this, as well.) Second, many executive compensation \nschemes are partially tied to earnings targets.  \n \nThe EPS management motivation has no sound financial basis. Whether a buyback program \nincreases or decreases earnings per share is a function of the price/earnings multiple and either \nthe company\u2019s forgone after-tax interest income or the after-tax cost of new debt the company \nuses to finance the buyback. More concretely, when the inverse of the price/earnings multiple\u2014\noften called the earnings yield\u2014is higher than the after-tax interest rate, a buyback adds to \nearnings per share. When the earnings yield is less than the after-tax interest rate, a buyback \nreduces earnings per share. The relationship between the earnings yield and the after-tax interest \nrate has little or nothing to say about value. \n \nHere\u2019s a very simple example. Assume three companies (A, B, and C) have identical $100 cash \nbalances, operating income, tax rates, shares outstanding, and earnings per share. Only their \nstock prices are different. (See Exhibit 7.) \n \nNow assume each company uses its $100 cash balance to buy back stock. A, B, and C can buy \nten, three, and two shares, respectively. We can see that earnings per share rise for company A, \nremain unchanged for company B, and decline for company C. Note that the changes in earnings \nper share are completely independent of the relationship between price and expected value. A \nbuyback of an overvalued stock can add to earnings per share while decreasing value for \ncontinuing shareholders and a buyback of an undervalued stock can reduce earnings per share \nwhile enhancing value for ongoing holders. \n \nThus, earnings-per-share accretion or dilution has nothing to do with whether a buyback makes \neconomic sense because the relationship between the P/E and the interest rate dictates the \naccretion or dilution, while the relationship between price and expected value dictates a stock \nbuyback\u2019s economic merits.  \n \nRepurchasing overvalued shares or refraining from buying undervalued shares because of the \nunfavorable earnings-per-share impact is shareholder-unfriendly finance. Similarly, the notion that \nbuybacks of high-P/E stocks are bad, or that buybacks of low P/E stocks are good, defies \neconomic reasoning.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

In this case, companies aim to buy enough shares to keep the \nlevel of outstanding shares constant. Over 30 percent of the S&P 500 companies repurchasing \nsince 2000 have not seen a net shrinkage in shares outstanding.  \n \nAlthough evidence suggests that part of the surge in share repurchases in the 1990s was related \ndirectly to countering the potentially dilutive impact of option grants, research shows the market \nreacts less favorably to repurchases by companies with substantial option programs. 16 \n \nWe strongly believe that managers should weigh the merits of a buyback and a compensation \nprogram separately. Buybacks effected solely to offset dilution from employee stock option \nprograms risk destroying shareholder value for ongoing shareholders. The argument against this \nmotivation runs similar to the one against EPS management: the magnitude and timing of the \nbuybacks have nothing to do with the price-to-value gap.  \n \nOn the other hand, companies buying back stock to offset dilution are not necessarily destroying \nvalue for ongoing shareholders, as some pundits assume. Even if the motives are not correct, the \noutcome can be consistent with creating value. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Specifically, \nbuybacks efficiently increase the debt/equity ratio for underleveraged firms. An appropriate level \nof financial leverage results in an optimal capital structure\u2014a healthy balance between beneficial \ntax shields and the risk of financial distress. This minimizes the cost of capital, which enhances \nshareholder value. (See Exhibit 8).  \n \nDespite evidence that incorporating debt into the capital structure can increase firm value, the \nsuggestion that leverage is a source of value creation from buybacks is less clear. 17, 18 Further, \nchanges in the tax law have made debt relatively less attractive than equity. \n \nExhibit 8: Optimal Capital Structure \n \nPV (costs\nof financial\ndistress)\nPV (tax\nshield)\nValue if\nall-equity\nfinanced\nOptimal\ndebt ratio\nDebt ratio\nMarket value\n \nSource: Richard A.

Unsurprisingly, investors generally cheer debt-increasing financial maneuvers with a \nhigher stock price.20  \n \nOther relevant capital structure considerations include the following:  \n \n\u2022 The value of a tax shield is measurable. For a company with positive pretax profits, \ntax-deductible interest expense creates a valuable tax shield. We can estimate the \nvalue of this shield using one of two ways. The first approach, which assumes a \npermanent change in capital structure, is to capitalize the tax savings. 21 You calculate \nthis by dividing the tax savings (interest expense times the marginal tax rate) by the \npretax cost of debt. Second is the adjusted present value (APV) method.22 APV \ndetermines business value by summing its unlevered value and the value of its \nfinancial strategy. APV offers more flexibility than capitalizing tax shields because it \naccommodates changing capital structures.   \n  \n\u2022 Varying tax rates complicate the debt versus equity decision. As seen above, changes \nin corporate, personal, and capital gains tax rates can amplify or dampen the \nadvantage of debt versus equity financing.23 The current tax code slightly favors the \nprudent use of debt.  \n \n\u2022 At a certain point, the risks of financial distress outweigh the benefit of debt. Too \nmuch debt can lead to an inability to meet contractually obligated commitments, even \nfor a business with healthy cash flows. Financial distress is onerous, with substantial \ndirect and indirect costs. Direct costs include legal and administrative fees in \nbankruptcy. Indirect costs include forgone business with suppliers and customers \nuncertain about the future of a financially distressed firm. Managers should weigh the \nbenefit of financial leverage against the potential cost. \n    \n\u2022 What about financial flexibility? Managers often argue that a conservative capital \nstructure is important in order to maintain financial flexibility, especially for companies \nlargely reliant on intangible capital. 24 We can define financial flexibility as the ability to \nquickly access capital for an attractive investment opportunity or to weather a \nbusiness downturn. This option has questionable value for a couple of reasons. First, \na company can generally raise the capital required to fund value-creating projects, be \nit debt or equity, rapidly and cheaply. Second, managers often do not take into \naccount the opportunity cost of excess capital parked on the balance sheet. If \nshareholders can redeploy funds at a rate higher than what the cash earns, the \ncompany should return the capital to shareholders.  \n \nConclusion \n \nGiven the substantial overcapitalization of many companies in America today, understanding how \na company is likely to allocate capital is more important than ever. While buybacks reached \nrecord levels in 2005, the motivations behind buybacks do not always follow solid economic \nreasoning. Investors are well served to study the issues around buybacks, and insist the \ncompanies they invest in do the right thing. \n  \n"

Simply, we can state: \n \nEarnings growth = (1 \u2013 payout ratio) x ROE \n \nOver the last fifty years, the payout ratio (heavily determined by dividends until the mid-1980s) \nhas been just over 50 percent and ROE in the 12 to 13 percent range, yielding nominal earnings \ngrowth of 6 to 7 percent. Inflation during the same period averaged 3 to 4 percent.  \n \nIn turn, we can decompose ROE using the DuPont formula: \n \nROE = net margin x asset turnover x financial leverage  \n \nThe S&P 500\u2019s estimated 2005 ROE of roughly 18 percent is above-average, reflecting high \nmargins and average ratios for asset turnover and financial leverage. If today\u2019s ROE persists, one \nof the equation\u2019s factors has to change:  \n \n\u2022 \nEarnings growth will exceed historic rates. We find this unlikely because aggregate \ngrowth is governed by macro factors like GDP growth.  \n\u2022 \nThe payout will rise. An increase in payout ratios via dividends and buybacks is the most \nlikely of these scenarios.  \n\u2022 \nFinancial leverage will decline further. Corporate America is arguably already \nunderleveraged, and there has been a steady drumbeat from investors encouraging more \nleverage.    \n \nAlternatively, ROE\u2019s can come down, reverting toward the cost of capital. So what\u2019s the chance \nROE\u2019s will remain at today\u2019s lofty levels? In their book, Our Brave New World, the GaveKal \nresearchers point to the emergence of platform companies\u2014entities that focus mostly on product \ndesign and marketing and outsource manufacturing to countries with lower labor costs. They \nargue the rise of platform companies leads to greater capital efficiency, lower volatility, and higher \nreturns on equity. 26 \n \nOn the surface, the data do not seem to support the thesis, as asset turnover ratios are just \naverage. But the aggregate ratio obscures the sharp rise in goodwill as the result of robust \nmergers and acquisitions activity in the last 10-15 years, as well as the substantial buildup of \nexcess cash. Returns on tangible operating assets have been rising steadily. Further, asset \nturnover ratios have risen sharply and leverage ratios have dropped significantly in recent years. \nSee Exhibit 10.  \n \nExhibit 10: Asset Turnover and Leverage (S&P Industrials) \n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n0.90\n0.95\n1Q02\n2Q02\n3Q02\n4Q02\n1Q03\n2Q03\n3Q03\n4Q03\n1Q04\n2Q04\n3Q04\n4Q04\n1Q05\n2Q05\n3Q05\nAsset Turnover\n2.4\n2.5\n2.6\n2.7\n2.8\n2.9\n3.0\n3.1\nLeverage\nAsset Turnover\nLeverage\n \nSource: Compustat, Morgan Stanley.  \n"

The analysis provides a formula to \ndetermine how much a company can increase its per-share intrinsic value by buying back \nundervalued shares. \n \nIn our example, a CFO correctly believes that the market undervalues her $10 stock by 20%. Despite \ncommunicating the firm\u2019s excellent prospects to investors, this discount persists. See Exhibit 14. \n \nExhibit 14: CFO\u2019s Perception versus Market Reality \nTrading value of total firm\n$               800 \nIntrinsic value of total firm\n1,000\n$            \nTrading value per share\n8.00\n$              \nIntrinsic value per share\n10.00\n$            \nShares outstanding\n100.0\n              \n \n \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n \nThe CFO decides to take advantage of this opportunity by repurchasing 20% of the outstanding \nshares. She uses the firm\u2019s $160 in cash to purchase 20 shares at the market price of $8 per share. \nThis lowers the intrinsic value of the firm by the $160, from $1,000 to $840. However, the firm now \nhas 20 less shares. On a per-share basis, then, intrinsic value rises from $10 to $10.50\u2014an increase \nof 5%.

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nPage 20 \n \nAppendix D: Why a Stock Buyback Earns the Cost of Equity in an Efficient Market \n \nOne basic principle in capital markets involves the trade off between risk and reward. The more risk, \nthe higher the return an investor will demand. Consequently, investors in risk-free government bonds \naccept returns of less than 5%, while venture capital investors demand 20% to 30% returns.  \n \nStocks lie somewhere in the middle of this range. Equity investors in public companies generally \nrequire a return in the neighborhood of 7% to 10%. This number is not set in stone because each \ncompany faces a different risk profile, varying from the stable cash flows of a utility to the volatile cash \nflows of a startup. In addition, debt can make equity more expensive, as debt is a prior claim on cash \nflows.  \n \nWhatever the cost of equity investors demand, however, the price of a stock should adjust so as to \nearn at least that return.  \n \nIndeed, in an efficient market, investors will bid stocks up and down until it becomes very difficult for \nan investor to earn more than the cost of equity. This is true whether we are talking about investors \npurchasing stock for their portfolios or companies repurchasing their shares in the open market. \n \nA Simple Example  \n \nHere\u2019s a simple example. Say two entities make separate promises to pay an investor $1,000 next \nyear. The first entity, the U.S. Treasury, is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government \nwhile the second entity is a risky high-tech startup company backed only by the start-up\u2019s uncertain \nearnings power. If an investor were to sell both IOUs to a third party, it\u2019s natural to expect that the \nrisk-free promise from the Treasury would be worth more than the riskier promise from the startup. \nPut more formally, while the timing and magnitude of the $1,000 cash flow is the same for both \nentities, the higher riskiness of the startup\u2019s promise makes it less valuable. \nTo value these promises, we turn to the standard discounting formula: \n \nflow\n \ncash\n \nthe\n \nreceive\n \n you\nbefore\n  \n years\nof\n \nnumber\nReturn)\n \nof\n \nRate\n \nDemanded\n \n \n(1\nFlow\n \nCash\n \n \n Value\nPresent\n+\n=\n \n \nIf we value the government\u2019s promise to pay $1,000 a year from today using a risk-free rate of 4%, \nwe find that this promise\u2019s present value is $961.54. \n \n54\n.\n961\n$\n(1.04)\n$1,000\n4%)\n \n \n(1\n$1,000\n \n \n Value\nPresent\n1\n=\n=\n+\n=\n \n \nSimilarly, we can value the startup\u2019s same promise, albeit with a higher demanded rate of return to \ncompensate for the higher business risk inherent in Internet startups. Using a higher discount rate of \n15%, we can calculate that the present value of the startup\u2019s promise is a much lower $869.57. \n \n57\n.\n869\n$\n(1.15)\n$1,000\n15%)\n \n \n(1\n$1,000\n \n \n Value\nPresent\n1\n=\n=\n+\n=\n \n \nThis simple example highlights that different prices have different embedded demanded rates of \nreturn. All things equal, a lower risk level translates to a lower discount rate, which means a higher \nstock price. Conversely, higher risk translates into a higher discount rate, which means a lower stock \nprice. \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nPage 21 \n \nA Realistic Example \n \nWe can also demonstrate this with a more complex, realistic example as well. To do this, we created \npro forma financial statements for a hypothetical company with a constant return on capital of 18%, \nand cash earnings that start at $90 million. We assume the company has a competitive advantage \nperiod (CAP) of five years\u2014that is, that investors believe the company will grow revenues for five \nyears (at a modest 5%). This growth also necessitates additional capital expenditure, as the \nincreasing annual investment during that same period reflects. For computational convenience, we \nalso assume the company has no debt and investors use a 10% cost of equity to discount the \ncompany\u2019s cash flows. Finally, we translate these pro forma statements into a standard discounted \ncash flow analysis. This calculation values the company at $968 million.

This will give us the share \nprice an investor would expect to enjoy with no change in the company\u2019s business plan and the \npassing of a year. \n \nWhile expected cash flows for this company will remain the same, the most important difference will \nbe the natural shortening of the CAP\u2014the period during which the company can generate excess \nreturns\u2014from five to four years. After all, since a year has elapsed and there is no change in the \nbusiness plan, the CAP will shorten. The other important difference is that the company will have \ngenerated a certain amount of excess cash.

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nPage 24 \n \nAppendix E: Why an Asset-Sale-Financed Stock Buyback Can Be Dilutive to Earnings \nbut Additive to Shareholder Value \n \nWith Wall Street so focused on earnings per share growth, we should expect that many corporate \nmanagers work to boost earnings per share and avoid diluting earnings at all costs. Indeed, many \nmanagers like share repurchase for precisely that reason. Buybacks have become a popular way to \naugment earnings per share. \n \nHowever, the accounting consequences of share buybacks are not always positive. For instance, \nmany accounting-focused managers avoid selling value-destroying divisions, even at a price above \nintrinsic value, if the sale results in lower earnings per share. This is particularly true for companies \nthat have executive compensation programs tied to EPS targets. Not surprisingly, we argue that \nexecutives should dwell on the economic consequences of such a decision.  \n \nTake for example a company with two divisions. The first division, Cash Cow, earns a return on \ninvested capital of 40% on $50 of invested capital. Assuming a 10% cost of capital, an 8% growth \nrate, and zero net investment, the standard perpetuity present value formula tells us the business is \nworth $1,000. [$1000 = $20/(10% - 8%).] The second business, the Dog division, earns only a 5% \nreturn on its $100 of invested capital. A no-growth business, Dog division\u2019s value is $50. [$50 = \n$5/10%.] \n \nAccordingly, the two divisions have a combined market capitalization of $1,050. With 100 shares \noutstanding, this translates to a price of $10.50 per share. See Exhibit 18. \n \nExhibit 18: A Tale of Two Divisions \n \n\"Cash Cow\" \nDivision\n\"Dog\" \nDivision\nCash earnings\n20\n$                 \n5\n$              \nInvested capital\n50\n                   \n100\n            \nEarnings per share contribution\n0.20\n                \n0.05\n           \nReturn on invested capital\n40%\n5%\nGrowth in cash earnings\n8%\n0%\nValue\n1,000\n$            \n50\n$            \n \nMarket value of total firm\n1,050\n$            \nShares outstanding\n100\n                 \nPrice per share\n10.50\n$            \nTotal earnings\n25.00\n$            \nEarnings per share\n0.25\n$              \nPrice-to-earnings ratio\n42 x  \n \nNote: Assumes 10% cost of capital and that capital expenditures equal depreciation. \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n \nIn our example, another firm approaches our company and offers to buy the assets of Dog for book \nvalue of $100. This amount is double Dog\u2019s intrinsic value. As management has no investment \nneeds, they would return this money to shareholders via share repurchase. Should management \naccept this offer? \n \nThe accounting and economic analyses give different answers. An economic analysis indicates that \nthe company is now worth $50 more, as it now has $100 in cash versus owning a business worth \n$50. Thus, firm value jumps from $1,050 to $1,100. Accordingly, before the company repurchases its \nshares, the share price would jump to $11 to reflect this improvement. After the company returns the \n$100 in cash to shareholders by repurchasing 9.1 shares, the company\u2019s value will fall back to \n$1,000. However, as there will now be only 90.9 shares outstanding, the per-share value of our \n"

Given the reported earnings per share drop, many managers would incorrectly \nchoose to pass on this value-creating opportunity. \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n  \n    \n"
