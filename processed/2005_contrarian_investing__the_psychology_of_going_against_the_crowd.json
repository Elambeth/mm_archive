      "text": " \n \n \nLegg Mason Capital \nManagement \nMarch 8, 2005 \nContrarian Investing: \nThe Psychology of Going Against the Crowd \n \nMichael J. Mauboussin \nExcerpts from a presentation given to the Greenwich Roundtable, February 24, 2005 \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \nGood morning. In addressing this morning\u2019s topic, I\u2019d like to make three points: \n \n\u2022 \nFirst, I will try to define what contrarian investing means; at least I\u2019ll try to offer one way \nto think about it. This part will define one of the hardest parts of investing and one of \nthe most common errors: a failure to distinguish between fundamentals and \nexpectations. \n \n\u2022 \nSecond, I\u2019ll spend a few moments on market efficiency, a terribly important issue that \nmost active managers don\u2019t seem to think about much. This section will propose some \nideas on how and why markets are efficient, which will lead us to a discussion of how \nand why markets periodically become inefficient. \n \nmmauboussin@lmfunds.com \n\u2022 \nFinally, I\u2019d like to touch on why it\u2019s so hard to be a contrarian investor. I will argue that \nthere are two types of constraints: institutional and psychological. Clearing either one of \nthese hurdles is difficult for an investor; clearing both is nearly impossible. \n \nWhat the Game is About \n \nWhen I consult my dictionary, a contrarian is \u201cone who takes a contrary view\u201d with contrary \ndefined as \u201cbeing not in conformity with what is usual or expected.\u201d Basically, a contrarian runs \nagainst the crowd.  \n \nLet me start with an obvious statement: the simple act of being a contrarian will make no one \nrich. In fact, conforming generally makes the most strategic sense. If you\u2019re in a movie theatre \nthat catches on fire, you\u2019d be best served to run out of the theatre in contrast to the contrarian \ntack to run into the theatre.  \n \nThis point may seem trivial, but it has very deep-seated psychological roots. Many survival \nstrategies in the animal kingdom rely on cooperation. One simple example is flocking\u2014schools \nof fish, or flocks of sparrows, act in unison to minimize the threat of a predator.     \n \nIf being different\u2014not conforming\u2014is not the sole goal, what should the aspiring contrarian \nfocus on? Here I turn to a common sense distinction that I would argue is the single most \ncommon error in the investment business: failure to distinguish between the fundamentals of \nthe situation (for example, the fundamentals of a company in the case of stocks) and the \nexpectations reflected in the asset price. \n \nHorse racing provides a good metaphor for this distinction. There are two issues: how well the \nhorse will likely run\u2014to figure out the fundamentals you\u2019d look at the horse\u2019s record, the stable \nit came from, the jockey, the track conditions, etc.\u2014and the expectations, which show up as the \nodds posted on the board. \n \nEvidence shows that horse racing is a pretty efficient market. To quote a study by Professor \nRay Sauer on the topic, \u201cprices set in these markets, to a first approximation, are efficient \nforecasts of outcomes.\u201d 1\n"

      "text": " \n \n \n \nA contrarian investor focuses not only on the general sentiment, but more importantly on how that sentiment can \nlead to disconnects between fundamentals and expectations.  \n \nTo continue with the horseracing theme, I\u2019d like to read a quotation from Steven Crist, now Chairman of the Daily \nRacing Form and for many years the New York Times reporter covering horse racing. Crist contributed a chapter \nto a book called Bet with the Best. Crist\u2019s 13-page chapter \u201cCrist on Value\u201d is fabulous reading and stacks right up \nagainst Warren Buffett and Ben Graham.  \n \nHere\u2019s Crist\u2019s comment, and please mentally strike out \u201chorse\u201d and insert \u201cstock\u201d: 2\n \nThe issue is not which horse in the race is the most likely winner, but which horse or horses are offering \nodds that exceed their actual chances of victory   . . . This may sound elementary, and many players \nmay think that they are following this principle, but few actually do. Under this mindset, everything but \nthe odds fades from view. There is no such thing as \u201cliking\u201d a horse to win a race, only an attractive \ndiscrepancy between his chances and his price. (Emphasis added.) \n \nThe successful hedge fund manager, Michael Steinhardt, shared a very similar view in his 2001 autobiography: 3\n \nI defined variant perception as holding a well-founded view that was meaningfully different than the \nmarket consensus . . . Understanding market expectation was at least as important as, and often \ndifferent from, the fundamental knowledge. (Emphasis added.) \n \nNow ask yourself, very honestly, how clearly do you distinguish between fundamentals and expectations? If \nyou\u2019re like most people, not very clearly. I quote a psychologist Robert Zajonc, who sums it up pretty well: 4\n \nWe sometimes delude ourselves that we proceed in a rational manner and weigh all of the pros and \ncons of various alternatives. But this is seldom the actual case. Quite often \u201cI decided in favor of X\u201d is \nno more than \u201cI liked X\u201d. . . We buy the cars we \u201clike,\u201d choose the jobs and houses we find \u201cattractive,\u201d \nand then justify these choices by various reasons.   \n \nMoreover, what we like is heavily influenced by what other people like.  Successful contrarian investing isn\u2019t about \ngoing against the grain per se, it\u2019s about exploiting expectations gaps. If this assertion is true, it leads to an \nobvious question: how do these expectations gaps arise? Or, more basically, how and why are markets \ninefficient? \n \nThe Rules of the Game \n \nIn his excellent book, Inefficient Markets, Harvard professor Andrei Shleifer summarizes the three arguments that \nunderpin the efficient market hypothesis (EMH): 5\n \n1. Investors are rational, and value securities rationally. This is the basis for so-called general equilibrium \nmodels. \n2. Investors are not rational, but their errors are independent, and hence cancel out, leaving us with an \n\u201cefficient solution.\u201d And, \n3. The no-arbitrage assumption\u2014even if some investors are irrational, rational arbitrageurs swoop in and \neliminate those inefficiencies.  \n \nThe burgeoning behavioral finance field takes aim at the efficient market hypothesis, focusing its efforts on \nundermining number one, the rational agent model, and number three, the no-arbitrage assumption. By and large, \nthough, behavioral finance dismisses the second alternative out-of-hand. We\u2019ll come back to that in a moment. \n \nNo one really believes the rational agent model any more\u2014or at least no one takes it too literally\u2014although it \ndoes provide some very elegant solutions.  The main focus of the behavioral finance attacks on EMH has been on \nthe limits to arbitrage\u2014that since arbitrage is nowhere close to costless, riskless, and there are no perfect \nsubstitutes\u2014many inefficiencies exist\u2014even if they can\u2019t be exploited profitably.  \n \nPage 2  \n \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

      "text": " \n \n \nLet\u2019s revisit the second way to achieve market efficiency\u2014the interaction of heterogeneous investors. Over the \npast 20 years some important developments occurred in this area, generally put under the larger rubric of \n\u201ccomplex adaptive systems.\u201d  Complex adaptive systems are ubiquitous, and have some common features: \n \n1.   The system starts with a group of heterogeneous agents, be they ants, or cells, or investors;  \n2. The agents interact, leading to a feature called \u201cemergence\u201d \n3. A global system results. \n \nImportantly, the features and attributes of the global system are distinct from the underlying agents. The sum is \ngreater than the addition of the parts. Reductionism doesn\u2019t work; you can\u2019t understand the global system by \nunderstanding each individual part. \n \nA classic example of a complex adaptive system is an ant colony\u2014study the system at the colony level and you \nwill observe an adaptive and robust system with a life cycle vastly beyond the lifespan of any ant. But interview \nthe individual ants and they will have no idea what\u2019s going on at the global level\u2014they operate with local \ninformation and local interaction. \n \nWe can easily view the stock market as a good example of a complex adaptive system. You have investor \ndiversity\u2014growth versus value, long-term versus short-term, fundamental versus technical, and tips from Uncle \nBob. You have an aggregation mechanism called the stock exchange, and you have a global system, or output, in \nstock prices. \n \nBut not all is perfect in complex adaptive system land. You need certain conditions in place for efficiency to \nprevail. We believe these conditions are: \n \n1. Agent diversity \n2. An aggregation mechanism \n3. Incentives \n \nJim Surowiecki deftly articulated this line of thinking in his delightful book, The Wisdom of Crowds.  Surowiecki \nargued that when these conditions are in place, the crowd will outperform a vast majority of individuals, including \nexperts. Perhaps I can put this more bluntly: When these conditions are in place, markets are efficient.  \n \nJust to close the loop on behavioral finance, some critics claim investors are not diverse because they make \nerrors in exactly the same way. About investor diversity Shleifer writes,6 \u201cit is this argument that the Kahneman \nand Tversky theories dispose of entirely.\u201d  I don\u2019t know if Prof. Shleifer has spent much time with real investors, \nbut to suggest they all act in concert all the time presses the limit of credibility. \n \nIf markets are efficient when these conditions prevail, when do they become inefficient? The answer, I believe, is \nwhen one of the three conditions is violated. By far the most likely is investor diversity.  \n \nWe know from studying social psychology that diversity breakdowns occur periodically. As humans, we like to \nbelong to the group, but we\u2019re willing to join in with the group to varying degrees: more formally, we all have \ndifferent adoption thresholds.  \n \nThe one point I\u2019ll add, but won\u2019t develop, is that these systems are non-linear. They are subject to critical points. \nSo you can see diversity breakdowns start but without any notable influence on prices. Then, there\u2019s the \nproverbial \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d and the system changes states very quickly.  \n \nReturning to the power of being part of the group, psychology professor Solomon Asch performed a series of \nexperiments at Yale in the 1950s. Asch\u2019s experimental groups had eight members\u2014seven were in on the \nexperiment and the eighth was the subject. Each member of the group had to identify which line (of three choices) \nwas of the same length as the sample line. The task was very simple, and in trial runs subjects effectively got \n100% correct. \n \nAsch then signaled the seven in the know to offer wrong answers. Thirty five percent of the subjects went with the \nmajority, even when the answer was obviously wrong! 7\nPage 3  \n \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

      "text": " \n \n \n \nSo the key is to find diversity breakdowns and make sure the \u201codds\u201d compensate you for the risk you are \nassuming. Neither of these tasks is easy.  \n \nThere is no doubt that diversity breakdowns occur. This means stock market risk is endogenous and exogenous.  \nStill, diversity breakdowns are more the exception than the rule.   \n \nNed Davis\u2019s book, The Triumph of Contrarian Investing, offers a host of indicators that help identify sentiment \nextremes, or diversity breakdowns. \n \nOne of my favorite examples is called the \u201cCurse of Lyford Cay.\u201d For the past 20 years or so, Morgan Stanley has \nhosted a conference of the smartest investors around to discuss markets and stocks. Barton Biggs, the long-time \nhead of strategy at Morgan Stanley, noted that the Lyford Cay consensus often proved to be a great signal to bet \nthe other way. For example, the overwhelming majority of investors in late 2003 felt that rates were going higher \nin 2004. When the dust settled in 2004, yields on the 10-year Government note were actually lower. \n \nThe Constraints \n \nOK. Even if you\u2019ve accepted my arguments up to this point, you might ask, \u201cwhy don\u2019t more people try to do this?\u201d \nIn this case, two significant types of constraints act on investors.  \n \nThe first I call organizational constraints, but they basically emanate from agency problems. I think Charley Ellis \nframed it best when he contrasted the \u201cbusiness\u201d from the \u201cprofession\u201d of investing. The business is about \ngenerating fees; while there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a vibrant business, actions that seek solely to maximize \nfees (or keep them from dropping) can be detrimental to performance. The profession is about delivering superior \nlong-term results for your shareholders. \n \nThe challenge is that the pendulum feels like it has swung from the profession to the business. The number of \nmutual funds and hedge funds has massively proliferated in recent years, and the new funds are often launched \nprecisely where performance has been best in the recent past! For example, Jack Bogle notes that 44 equity \nmutual funds advertised in the March 2000 issue of Money magazine\u2014mostly hot tech funds\u2014had average one-\nyear results of 85.6%. This is the exact opposite of what contrarian investing is all about, although it is arguably \ngood business\u2014at least for the short-term.   \n \nAnother example is that fees over the years have been rising, not falling. Many mutual funds companies seek to \nmaintain assets, so they ask their portfolio managers to minimize tracking error. Many portfolio managers \ncomplain that too much of their time is dedicated to bringing in assets versus delivering financial performance. \n \nHedge funds are not immune to these agency issues. The recent popularity of absolute return strategies may \ncause some managers to make shorter-term bets than what makes ideal economic sense. The recent introduction \nof long-only funds by some prominent hedge funds raises some interesting questions, as well. \n \nEven if an investor operates in an environment focused on the profession, successful contrarian investing \nrequires a certain psychological makeup.  \n \nOne of Keynes\u2019s many great lines is, \u201cWorldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally \nthan to succeed unconventionally.\u201d 8 There is no better lead in for the significant psychological constraints of \ncontrarian investing. Without dwelling on the various sub-points, two major psychological requirements capture \nthe idea: \n \n1. Independence.  Again, the goal is not to be a contrarian just to be a contrarian, but rather to feel \ncomfortable betting against the crowd when the gap between fundamentals and expectations warrants \nit. This independence is difficult because the widest gap often coincides with the strongest urge to be \npart of the group. Independence also incorporates the notion of objectivity\u2014an ability to assess the \nodds without being swayed by outside factors. After all, prices not only inform investors, they also \ninfluence investors. \n \nPage 4  \n \n             Legg Mason Capital Management \n \n"

      "text": " \n \n \n2. Long-term orientation.  Investing is inherently a probabilistic exercise, where process should be the \nfocus versus short-term outcomes. Contrarian investors acknowledge that it may take some time for the \nmarket to revise expectations. This problem is compounded by myopic loss aversion, the idea that the \nmore frequently you assess your portfolio, the more likely you are to see losses and hence suffer loss \naversion.  \n \nTo conclude, contrarian investing is clearly very difficult. The first step toward successful investing is clarifying the \nissues and how best to think about them.
