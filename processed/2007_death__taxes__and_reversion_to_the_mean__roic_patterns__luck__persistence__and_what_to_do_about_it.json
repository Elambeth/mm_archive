      "text": " \n \n \nPage 2 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \n \n \nThe Inside-Outside View \n \nCompany financial models are often a cornerstone of the stock selection process for fundamental \ninvestors. The model forecasts are based on crucial value drivers like sales growth rates, operating \nprofit margins, investment capital needs, and economic returns. When done properly, detailed long-\nterm models are laborious because they require input from a wide range of areas, including historical \ncorporate performance, firm-specific issues, competitive positioning, and the broader macroeconomic \nbackdrop. \n \nDespite earnest and diligent study, analysts often produce company models that are wildly off the \nmark, usually erring on the side of optimism. Even analysts who consider ranges of value outcomes \nattach probabilities to favorable scenarios that are too high. Some researchers attribute this \ninaccuracy to overconfidence, but that is only part of the story. 1  \n \nAnother way to understand the challenge is based on what renowned psychologist Daniel Kahneman \ncalls the inside-outside view. 2 An inside view considers a problem by focusing on the specific task \nand the information at hand, and predicts based on that unique set of inputs. This is the approach \nanalysts most often use in their modeling, and indeed is common for all forms of planning. \n \nIn contrast, an outside view considers the problem as an instance in a broader reference class. \nRather than seeing the problem as unique, the outside view asks if there are similar situations that \ncan provide useful calibration for modeling. Kahneman notes this is a very unnatural way to think \nprecisely because it forces analysts to set aside all of the cherished information they have unearthed \nabout a company. This is why people use the outside view so rarely. \n \nThis report seeks to shed light on an important reference class for company modelers: patterns of \nreturn on invested capital (ROIC). Companies create shareholder value when they generate returns \non investment in excess of the cost of capital. A positive spread between a company\u2019s ROIC and cost \nof capital is a fundamental indicator of value creation.  \n \nEarnings growth by itself gives no indication about value creation prospects\u2014a company growing \nrapidly but earning only its cost of capital will not enjoy a premium valuation. 3 More accurately, \ngrowth amplifies: higher growth makes positive-spread companies more valuable, and, symmetrically, \nhigher growth makes negative-spread companies less valuable.  \n \nAssumptions about future corporate ROICs are embedded in analyst models, although they are rarely \nexplicit. More often than not, analysts are too optimistic in their assessment of future ROICs, in part \nbecause they are unaware of how hard it is to sustain high returns. The goal of this report is to make \nfinancial modelers aware of a broad reference class\u2014the outside view\u2014that unequivocally shows the \nrarity of generating high returns for a long time in a free market system. This awareness should \ntemper the optimism embedded in many models. \n \nHere are some of the report\u2019s broad conclusions: \n \n\u2022 \nReversion to the mean is a powerful force. As has been well documented by numerous \nstudies, ROIC reverts to the cost of capital over time. This finding is consistent with \nmicroeconomic theory, and is evident in all time periods researchers have studied. \nHowever, investors and executives should be careful not to over interpret this result \nbecause reversion to the mean is evident in any system with a great deal of randomness. \nWe can explain much of the mean reversion series by recognizing the data are noisy.  \n \n\u2022 \nPersistence does exist. Academic research shows that some companies do generate \npersistently good, or bad, economic returns. The challenge is finding explanations for that \npersistence, if they exist.  \n \n\u2022 \nExplaining persistence. It\u2019s not clear that we can explain much persistence beyond chance. \nBut we investigated logical explanatory candidates, including growth, industry \n"

Business model difference appears to be a promising \nexplanatory factor.  \n \n\u2022 \nImplications for modeling. The vast majority of models\u2014especially discounted cash flow \nmodels\u2014are uninformed by the outside view of ROIC patterns. This outside view \naddresses a number of important aspects of modeling, including assumptions about growth \nrates, capital needs, and terminal values. \n \nDeath, Taxes, and Reversion to the Mean \n \nResearchers have convincingly showed that industries and companies follow an economic life cycle \n(see Exhibit 1). 4 Young companies often apply substantial resources to their business without \nimmediate payoff, hence generating returns below the cost of capital. In mid-life, companies earn \nexcess returns as their investments bear fruit. Finally, competitive forces and/or shifts in the \nmarketplace drive returns down to the cost of capital. In situations where returns sink below the cost \nof capital, bankruptcy, consolidation, and disinvestment often serve to lift returns back to cost-of-\ncapital levels. Empirical research shows that manufacturing companies, on average, generate excess \nreturns for shorter periods than they did in the past. 5   \n \nExhibit 1: Generic Life Cycle \n \n \n \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n \nVarious studies conducted over multiple decades document this reversion-to-the-mean pattern. 6 We \nhave reproduced the results here, using data from over 1000 non-financial companies from 1997 to \n2006. (See Appendix A for details on the sample and methodology.)  Exhibit 2 shows this process. \nWe start by ranking companies into quintiles based on their 1997 ROIC. We then follow the median \nROIC for the five cohorts through 2006. While all of the returns do not settle at the cost of capital \n(roughly eight percent) in 2006, they clearly migrate toward that level. \n \nExhibit 2: Median ROIC Reversion \n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nNumber of years following portfolio formation\nROIC - WACC (%)\n \nSource: LMCM analysis. \nROIC-WACC Spread\nTime\n"

That gap narrows significantly to 8.6 percentage points in 2006. Further, as the reversion \nmodel would predict, the top quintiles saw declines in median ROICs and the bottom quintiles saw \nimprovement (see Exhibit 3). While nine years may not be a sufficient amount of time for returns of all \nquintiles to converge on the cost of capital, it\u2019s clear that the process is well under way.   \n \nExhibit 3: Change in Median ROIC by Quintile \n \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n \nThis result, however, requires careful interpretation. Any system that combines skill and luck will \nexhibit mean reversion over time. 7 Francis Galton demonstrated this point in his 1889 book, Natural \nInheritance, using the heights of adults. 8 Galton showed, for example, that children of tall parents \nhave a tendency to be tall, but are often not as tall as their parents. Likewise, children of short parents \ntend to be short, but not as short as their parents. Heredity plays a role, but over time adult heights \nrevert to the mean.  \n \nThe basic idea is outstanding performance combines strong skill and good luck. Abysmal \nperformance, in contrast, reflects weak skill and bad luck. Even if skill persists in subsequent periods, \nluck evens out across the participants, pushing results closer to average. So it\u2019s not that the standard \ndeviation of the whole sample is shrinking; rather, luck\u2019s role diminishes over time.  \n \nSeparating the relative contributions of skill and luck is no easy task. Naturally, sample size is crucial \nbecause skill only surfaces with a large number of observations. For example, statistician Jim Albert \nestimates that a baseball player\u2019s batting average over a full season is a fifty-fifty combination \nbetween skill and luck. Batting averages for 100 at-bats, in contrast, are 80 percent luck. 9  \n \nTo illustrate this skill and luck mix, we analyzed the batting averages of 100 major league baseball \nplayers who had at least 250 at-bats for each of the past five seasons (see Exhibit 4). These results \nlikely show some survivorship bias, as the average career of a major leaguer is only 5.6 years. \n \n \n \n \n \nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\n1997 Groups\n\u201897\n\u201806\nROIC-WACC (%)\n\u201897\n\u201806\n-15\n-10\n-5\n5\n10\n15\n25\n20\n"

For a company, skill is the equivalent of sustainable \nvalue creation, including industry effects and managerial capability. Luck captures external factors, \nincluding competition, business cycles, regulatory shifts, and technological change. \n \nDefying Gravity: Persistence in the ROIC Data \n \nThe next question is whether any companies buck the reversion-to-the-mean trend and sustain high \n(or low) ROICs throughout the sample period. To answer, we need to measure persistence\u2014the \nlikelihood a company will stay in the same quintile throughout the measured time frame. To state the \nobvious, staying in the top quintile is generally desirable, as it means the company is successfully \nfending off competition. 11 Conversely, dwelling in the lowest quintile is unwelcome.  \n \nExhibit 5 shows one measure of persistence: the degree of quintile migration. 12 This exhibit shows \nwhere companies starting in one quintile (the vertical axis) ended up after nine years (the horizontal \naxis). Most of the percentages in the exhibit are unremarkable, but two stand out. First, a full 41 \npercent of the companies that started in the top quintile were there nine years later, while 39 percent \nof the companies in the cellar-dweller quintile ended up there. Independent studies of this persistence \nreveal a similar pattern. So it appears there is persistence with some subset of the best and worst \ncompanies. Academic research confirms that some companies do show persistent results. Studies \nalso show that companies rarely go from very high to very low performance or vice versa. 13   \n \nExhibit 5: ROIC Persistence \n \nSource: LMCM analysis. \n \n39\n17\n14\n11\n19%\n18\n40\n25\n11\n6%\n17\n22\n28\n22\n12%\n12\n13\n21\n32\n23%\n24\n15\n8\n41%\n13\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\nQ5\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nROIC Quintile  in 1997\nROIC Quintile in 2006\n"

      "text": " \n \n \nPage 6 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \n \n \nBefore going too far with this result, we need to consider two issues. First, this persistence analysis \nsolely looks at where companies start and finish, without asking what happens in between. As it turns \nout, there is a lot of action in the intervening years. For example, less than half of the 41 percent of \nthe companies that start and end in the first quintile stay in the quintile the whole time. This means \nthat less than four percent of the total-company sample remains in the highest quintile of ROIC for the \nfull nine years.  \n \nThe second issue is serial correlation, the probability a company stays in the same ROIC quintile from \nyear to year. As Exhibit 5 suggests, the highest serial correlations (over 80 percent) are in Q1 and \nQ5. The middle quintile, Q3, has the lowest correlation of roughly 60 percent, while Q2 and Q4 are \nsimilar at about 70 percent.  \n \nThis result may seem counterintuitive at first, as it suggests results for really good and really bad \ncompanies (Q1 and Q5) are more likely to persist than for average companies (Q2, Q3, and Q4). But \nthis outcome is a product of the methodology: since each year\u2019s sample is broken into quintiles, and \nthe sample is roughly normally distributed, the ROIC ranges are much narrower for the middle three \nquintiles than for the extreme quintiles. So, for instance, a small change in ROIC level can move a Q3 \ncompany into a neighboring quintile, whereas a larger absolute change is necessary to shift a Q1 and \nQ5 company. Having some sense of serial correlations by quintile, however, provides useful \nperspective for investors building company models.   \n \nTo summarize, while the results reflect a lot of randomness, some companies appear to demonstrate \npersistence of high returns above and beyond what we can attribute solely to chance. 14 But similar to \nthe challenge in active investing, the question is, can we identify the persistent value-creating \ncompanies ahead of time? \n \nCan We Explain Persistence? \n \nUp to this point our results, while useful and instructive, are reasonably well known in the academic \nliterature. The real question for an investor is whether we can explain ROIC persistence ex ante. We \nexplore this question by looking at three variables that appear as good candidates to explain \npersistence: corporate growth, the industry in which a company competes, and the company\u2019s \nbusiness model. One of the virtues of these variables is they are to a large degree tractable. But \nclearly other variables may be relevant, including management quality. As such, the variables we \ninvestigate may be more proximate than causal. \n \nLet\u2019s start with growth, where there is good news and bad news. The good news is there appears to \nbe some correlation between growth and persistence. Companies that start and end in the top two \nquintiles enjoy average growth just above the 9.4 percent for the full sample. The four growth rates \nclosest to the upper-left corner in Exhibit 6 show this. \n \nSimilarly, the companies that start and end in the bottom two quintiles\u2014the four rates near the \nbottom-right corner of the exhibit\u2014grew at a well-below-average five percent rate. We can say much \nless about companies that went from good to bad (upper-right corner) or companies that went from \nbad to good (bottom-left corner) because the sample sizes are substantially smaller than the rest of \nthe exhibit. 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

We don\u2019t know \nwhether growth allows the company to sustain high returns or whether the growth is a consequence \nof the high returns. But it is safe to say that high returns appear difficult to sustain over time without \nsatisfactory growth. Further, the exhibit shows that growth by itself does little to assure attractive \neconomic returns; the companies that ended in the fifth quintile generated aggregate growth faster \nthan the total sample.  \n \nThe bad news about growth, especially for modelers, is it is extremely difficult to forecast. While there \nis some evidence for sales persistence, the evidence for earnings growth persistence is scant. As \nsome researchers recently summarized, \u201cAll in all, the evidence suggests that the odds of an investor \nsuccessfully uncovering the next stellar growth stock are about the same as correctly calling coin \ntosses.\u201d 16 This observation has important implications for modeling.  \n \nIndustry effects are another candidate to explain persistent excess returns. One approach is to simply \nsee which industries are overrepresented in the highest return quintile throughout our measured \nperiod. Industries that satisfy this requirement include pharmaceuticals/biotechnology and software. \nThis approach is flawed, however, because it fails to consider the full industry populations. For \nindustries with large-variance ROIC distributions, some companies will look good simply by virtue of \nthat distribution. Looking solely at the successful companies in these large-variance industries paints \na misleading picture of performance. 17 And, unfortunately, selecting successful companies and \nattaching attributes to them is a common practice in research. 18  \n \nLet\u2019s go back to our overrepresented industries, pharmaceuticals/biotechnology and software. It turns \nout these industries are not only represented in the highest quintile, but are also overrepresented in \nthe lowest quintile. Further, other industries\u2014utilities and telecom services\u2014have little representation \nin the best or worst quintiles. We can explain this by examining the ROIC distribution variance (see \nExhibit 7). Wide-variance industries have high- and low-performing companies, while the narrow-\nvariance industries are clustered in the middle ROIC quintiles.

Used with permission. \n \nAnother strand of research considers the regularities in abnormal profits, both good and bad. 19 This \nwork suggests industry effects are more important than firm-specific effects for high-performing \ncompanies, while the opposite is true for low-performing companies. This descriptive work suggests \npositive, sustainable ROICs emerge from a good strategic position within a generally favorable \nindustry. So industry does matter for explaining persistence, especially for sustainable above-average \nreturns. More accurately, persistent high ROICs, on average, combine an attractive industry with a \ngood business model. There is also good strategy research on the threats to sustainable superior \nperformance.  20    \n \nThis leads to a closer look at business models. Michael Porter introduced two generic sources of \ncompetitive advantage: differentiation and low-cost production. These are also known as consumer \nand production advantages. 21 We can relate these generic strategies to ROIC by breaking ROIC into \nits two prime components, net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margin and invested capital \nturnover. NOPAT margin equals NOPAT/sales, and invested capital turnover equals sales/invested \ncapital. ROIC is the product of NOPAT margin and invested capital turnover. \n \nGenerally speaking, differentiated companies with a consumer advantage generate attractive returns \nmostly via high margins and modest invested capital turnover. Consider the successful jewelry store \nthat generates large profits per unit sold (high margins) but doesn\u2019t sell in large volume (low turnover). \nIn contrast, a low-cost company with a production advantage will generate relatively low margins and \nrelatively high invested capital turnover. Think of a classic discount retailer, which doesn\u2019t make much \nmoney per unit sold (low margins) but enjoys great inventory velocity (high turnover).

People who model and plan are often too \noptimistic about the future because they limit their inputs to the specific task at hand and the \nrelevant information they have gathered for that task. The research of ROIC patterns, which has \nspanned decades, provides a large and robust reference class that can inform the inputs for any \nindividual company. We know a small subset of companies generate persistently attractive \nROICs\u2014levels that cannot be attributed solely to chance\u2014but we are not clear about the \nunderlying causal factors. Our sense is most models assume financial performance that is unduly \nfavorable given the forces of chance and competition. \n \n\u2022 \nUnderstand the model\u2019s hidden assumptions. The errors here tend to come in two distinct areas. \nFirst, analysts frequently project growth, driven by sales and operating profit margins, \nindependent of the investment needs necessary to support that growth. As a result, both \nincremental and aggregate ROICs are too high. A simple way to check for this error is to add an \nROIC line to the model. An appreciation of the degree of serial correlations in ROICs provides \nperspective on how much ROICs are likely to improve or deteriorate. \n \nThe second error is with the continuing, or terminal, value in a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. \nThe continuing value component of a DCF captures the firm\u2019s value for the time beyond the \nexplicit forecast period. Common estimates for continuing value include multiples (often of \nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\u2014EBITDA) and growth in \nperpetuity. In both cases, unpacking the underlying assumptions shows impossibly high future \nROICs. 23  \n \nTake, for example, a simple growth-in-perpetuity continuing value that equals NOPAT divided by \nthe cost of capital less growth. This assumption assumes that NOPAT can grow without \nadditional capital, leading to an upward drift of ROIC (see Exhibit 11).  This assumption is clearly \ninconsistent with the vast empirical evidence that returns mean revert.  \n \nExhibit 11: Exposing the Hidden Assumptions Behind the Growth-in-Perpetuity  \n \n \n \nSource: Tim Koller, Marc Goedhardt, and  David Wessels, Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, Fourth Edition (New York: John Wiley & Sons, \n2005), 286.

As the record shows, few companies sustain \nrapid growth rates, and predicting which companies will succeed in doing so is very challenging. \nExhibit 12 illustrates this point. The distribution on the left is the actual 10-year sales growth rate \nfor a large sample of companies with base year revenues of $500 million, which has a mean of \nabout six percent. The distribution on the right is the three-year earnings forecast, which has a 13 \npercent mean and no negative growth rates. While earnings growth does tend to exceed sales \ngrowth by a modest amount over time, these expected growth rates are vastly higher than what is \nlikely to appear. Further, as we saw earlier, there is greater persistence in sales growth rates than \nin earnings growth rates. \nAverage \nROIC\nWACC\nCV\nWACC \u2013 g\nNOPAT\n=\nCV\nWACC\nNOPAT\n=\nForecast period\nContinuing \nvalue period\nAverage \nROIC\nWACC\nCV\nWACC \u2013 g\nNOPAT\n=\nCV\nWACC\nNOPAT\n=\nForecast period\nContinuing \nvalue period\n"

Investors often perceive companies generating subpar \nROICs as attractive because of the prospects for unpriced improvements. The challenge to this \nstrategy comes on two fronts. First, research shows low-performing companies get higher \npremiums than average-performing companies, suggesting the market anticipates change for the \nbetter. 24 Second, companies don\u2019t often sustain recoveries. \n \nDefining a sustained recovery as three years of above-cost-of-capital returns following two years \nof below-cost returns, Credit Suisse research found that only about 30 percent of the sample \npopulation was able to engineer a recovery. Roughly one-quarter of the companies produced a \nnon-sustained recovery, and the balance\u2014just under half of the population\u2014either saw no \nturnaround or disappeared.

This discussion has focused exclusively on firm performance\u2014\nfundamentals\u2014and has purposefully avoided shareholder returns. For active investors, of course, \nthe objective is to find mispriced securities or situations where the expectations implied by the \nstock price don\u2019t accurately reflect the fundamental outlook. 25 A company with great fundamental \nperformance may earn a market rate of return if the stock price already reflects the fundamentals. \nYou don\u2019t get paid for picking winners; you get paid for unearthing mispricings. Failure to \ndistinguish between fundamentals and expectations is common in the investment business.  \n \nOne purpose of this report is to underscore the importance of embracing an inside-outside view in \nmodel building. Modelers uninformed about broader ROIC patterns are at a marked disadvantage \nto those who recognize and reflect these empirical findings in their thinking. As Daniel Kahneman \nstresses, the outside view feels unnatural because it requires letting go of what you (think you) \nknow. \n \nAnother purpose is to highlight what we don\u2019t know. Randomness plays a large role in the \naggregate figures, whether or not we recognize it. And while we see some companies generate \npersistently superior ROICs\u2014that is, a greater number than chance alone allows\u2014we don\u2019t know \nprecisely why their returns are so good. Most of the proposed causal explanations fall prey to the \nhalo effect.      \n \n \n* * * \n \nSpecial thanks to Brian Lund for his valuable input throughout this project.

Since the \ntotal sample is 1,115 companies, each quintile contains 223 companies. So, for instance, the upper- \nleft corner of Exhibit 5 would include roughly 91 (0.41 x 223) companies. The growth rate in Exhibit 6 \nrelates to those companies. Note some of Exhibit 6\u2019s growth rates represent a very small sample.
