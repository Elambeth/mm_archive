This is important because the \nU.S. equity market is 53 percent of the global stock market as of December 31, 2016.1 The main feature of \nthis change is a sharp fall in the number of listed equities since 1996, which was preceded by a steady rise in \nlistings in the prior two decades. \n  \nAs a result of this drop, there are fewer listed companies today than there were in 1976, despite the fact that \nthe gross domestic product (GDP) is three times larger now than it was then. The Wilshire 5000 Total Market \nIndex, established in the mid-1970s to capture the 5,000 or so stocks with readily available price data, now \nhas only 3,816 stocks. The phenomenon is unique to the U.S. and is not easy to explain. Exhibit 1 shows a \nsnapshot of some pertinent statistics from 1976, 1996, and 2016. \n \nExhibit 1: Snapshots of the Investable Universe: 1976, 1996, and 2016 \n \nSource: Craig Doidge, G.

      "text": " \n \nMarch 22, 2017 \nThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks \n3 \nIn the past, economists considered frequent initial public offerings (IPOs) to be a strength of the U.S. and \nbelieved that they played an important role in encouraging entrepreneurship.4 But the weak listings in the U.S \nand the strong listings around the world have created what is now a large gap.  \n \nThis is important because it changes the nature of an investor\u2019s opportunity set. In 1976, an institutional \ninvestor who wanted exposure to U.S. equities had only to buy a diversified portfolio of public companies and \na venture capital (VC) fund. In 2016, that investor would have to have access to a diversified portfolio of public \ncompanies, a private equity fund, and opportunities in late-stage as well as early-stage venture capital.  \n \nIndividual investors today have a limited ability to access directly the complete U.S. equity market. The \ncompanies that are listed on exchanges are bigger, older, and in more concentrated sectors than two decades \nago. This likely contributes to public markets that are more informationally efficient than ever before.      \n \nThe change in the number of listed companies is a matter of simple addition and subtraction. Stocks that are \nnewly listed expand the population and stocks that are delisted shrink it. Additions occur when there is an IPO \nor a spin-off. Subtractions are the result of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), bankruptcy, and voluntary \ndelisting. M&A includes strategic deals, where one company buys another, and financial deals, where a \nleveraged-buyout or private equity fund acquires a company. Exhibit 18 in Appendix A provides a breakdown \nof the listings and how they change. \n \nCraig Doidge, Andrew Karolyi, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, professors of finance, estimate that just under one-half of \nthe listing gap is the result of a rapid rate of subtractions since 1996 and that just over one-half is the result of \na dearth of additions.5 In this report, we document these changes and discuss the consequences for investors. \nIn short, equity investors in the U.S. have to cast a much wider net than they did in the past to capture the \nreturn of U.S. equities.    \n \nThe Shrinking Stock Universe in the U.S.  \n \nExhibit 2 shows the rise and fall in listed companies in the U.S. from 1976 to 2016. Because new lists heavily \noutnumbered delists, especially in the late 1980s and 1990s, more than 2,500 companies were added from \n1976 through 1996. The pattern reverses after 1996, as delists outstrip new lists and the population of listed \ncompanies falls by 3,650 companies. The pattern holds for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange \nand the Nasdaq Stock Market.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Andrew Karolyi, Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, \u201cThe U.S. Listing Gap,\u201d Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 123, No. 3, March 2017, 464-\n487 and Credit Suisse estimates. \n \nThe size of the U.S. economy, as measured by GDP, expanded by almost 90 percent from 1976 to 1996. \nThis growth provided a fertile backdrop for the net increase in new listings. Total listings were half again as \nmany in 1996 as they were in 1976. The economy continued to chug along in the next 20 years, rising almost \n60 percent, but the number of listings dropped by half.  \n \nThis trend is more pronounced in the U.S. than in any other developed economy. For example, while the \nnumber of listings fell by roughly 50 percent in the U.S. from 1996 through 2016, it rose about 50 percent in \n13 developed countries that have complete data. Over the same period, listings rose 30 percent for a larger \npopulation of 71 non-U.S. countries. Because the number of listings shrank in the U.S. and expanded in the \nrest of the world, the U.S. now has a listing gap of more than 5,800 companies. A model of how many \ncompanies should be listed, based on GDP, GDP growth, population growth, and measures of corporate \ngovernance, suggests that the U.S. should have more than 9,500 listings.6  \n \nThere are two possible explanations for the gap. The first is a decline in the population of firms that are \ncandidates for listing. This is not the case. The number of firms eligible to list has grown modestly in the past \n20 years from about 550,000 to 590,000. While the rate of growth of firms that are eligible to list was higher \nfrom 1976 to 1996 than it was from 1996 to 2016, there is still a larger population of eligible companies \ntoday than there was 20 years ago.  \n \nThe second explanation is a fall in the propensity to list. We can frame the propensity to list in terms of costs \nand benefits. If there is a decline in the net benefit to listing, fewer companies will seek to list and more will \nchoose to delist. This appears to be the case over the past couple of decades. By one measure, the \npropensity to list in 2016 is half of what it was in 1996.    \n \n \n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\n8,000\n9,000\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\nNumber of Listed Firms\n= New Lists\n= Delists\n"

      "text": " \n \nMarch 22, 2017 \nThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks \n5 \nCosts of listing include a fee for listing on an exchange, expenses associated with mandatory disclosures, \nregulatory requirements, any competitive disadvantage from more expansive disclosure, and resources \ndedicated to communicating with current and prospective shareholders. Other potential costs include the \nperceived onus of quarterly earnings releases, the risk of being targeted by activist investors, and higher \nvisibility that can result in political pressure. Many of these costs are fixed and have risen in recent decades, \nwhich means they are more readily borne only by larger firms.7          \n \nRegulation looks like an obvious culprit. For instance, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 created new or \nexpanded standards for boards, management teams, and accounting firms. But while regulation undoubtedly \nincreased the cost of being public, the trend toward delisting was firmly in place prior to the implementation of \nSarbanes-Oxley.8  \n \nBenefits of listing include the ability to raise funds through the public market, the option to use shares for \ncompensation or M&A, and liquidity for shareholders. A listing also assures investors that the company has \nmet the standards to be public. A firm must meet a size threshold to enjoy these benefits, which increase with \nthe size of the firm.9   \n \nFinancial economists who have studied this phenomenon point out that a declining propensity to list predicts a \nhandful of outcomes, including delisting through mergers or going private via a private equity firm, fewer \nlistings through IPOs, and an increase in the average size of the companies that are public. The empirical \nresults since 1996 support all of these predictions. \n \nWe now examine the details of delisting and new listings, including the consequences for investors. Much of \nthe data we present comes from multiple sources and some is inferred. That said, we are confident that the \noverall themes have solid backing.  \n \nDelists \n \nThere are three reasons a company delists from an exchange. The first and most common is the company is \ninvolved in a merger or an acquisition. This can involve one public company buying another (Microsoft buys \nLinkedIn), a private company buying a public company (Dell buys EMC), or a company going private with the \nsponsorship of a private equity firm (Silver Lake acquires Dell). \n \nSecond the exchange can force a company to delist for cause. This means the company failed to meet certain \nrequirements, including maintaining a minimum stock price and market capitalization, or was not current with \nthe filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bankruptcy is another trigger for delisting for \ncause (Enron).  \n \nFinally, a company may choose to delist voluntarily. Here, the firm judges that the cost of listing outstrips the \nbenefit. The company may continue to trade but is no longer registered with an exchange.      \n \nExhibit 3 shows that mergers are the leading reason for delisting. Note that M&A tends to come in waves, so \ndelistings rise when overall M&A levels are up.10 Exhibit 4 shows the dollar volume of U.S. M&A activity from \n1976 to 2016. Dollar volume is indirectly related to delisting because the size of deals can vary, but both \nexhibits have a similar pattern. \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nMarch 22, 2017 \nThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks \n7 \nWe can separate M&A deals into those that are strategic, where one company buys another, and financial, \nwhere a company is acquired by a private equity firm.  \n \nThe majority of merger delistings are the result of strategic deals. As a result, the public companies that \nremain are more profitable than they were in prior decades and there is now higher concentration within \nindustries. We discuss these consequences in greater detail below.  \n \nA leveraged buyout (LBO) is a deal where a financial sponsor takes a company private using equity and \nsubstantial debt. Some LBOs occurred in the 1950s through 1970s, but the first LBO wave occurred in the \nlate 1980s. High yield bonds helped fuel this burst in activity. The pinnacle of that era was the $25 billion \nacquisition of RJR Nabisco in 1989 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (now KKR & Co.). \n \nExhibit 5 shows that following the late 1980s wave, deals by financial sponsors were modest until the mid-\n1990s. The rejuvenation of these deals by private equity firms coincides with the highest sum of listed firms. \nSince 2000, private equity buyouts account for about 9 percent of delistings, and represented almost one-\nquarter of all delisting in private equity\u2019s peak year of 2006.11  \n \nExhibit 5: Delistings as the Result of Private Equity Deals, 1976-2016 \n \nSource: Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, \u201cThe U.S. Listing Gap\u201d; Alexander Ljungqvist, Lars Persson, and Joacim T\u00e5g, \u201cPrivate Equity\u2019s Unintended Dark \nSide: On the Economic Consequences of Excessive Delistings,\u201d IFN Working Paper No. 1115, November 23, 2016; Credit Suisse estimates. \n \nIn 1980, there were only 24 private equity firms and deal volume only modestly exceeded $1 billion. Today, \nthere are more than 3,000 U.S. private equity firms and assets under management for buyout funds are \nroughly $825 billion, up from $80 billion in 1996 and less than $1 billion in 1976.12 Two of the largest private \nequity firms, The Carlyle Group and KKR & Co, each have more than 720,000 employees in their portfolio \ncompanies, which means they both employ more people than any U.S. listed company except for Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc.13  \n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\nNumber\n"

      "text": " \n \nMarch 22, 2017 \nThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks \n8 \nA company\u2019s decision to be listed comes down to an assessment of costs and benefits. If the benefits exceed \nthe costs, the firm lists. But if the costs subsequently exceed the benefits, a company may choose to again go \nprivate. Research shows that companies go private 13 years after their IPOs, on average, and have a higher \nlikelihood of going private if they have less analyst coverage, lower institutional ownership, and less liquidity \nthan their peers.14   \n \nPrivate equity funds have a finite life and generally hold companies for three to seven years.15 From 1970 \nthrough the mid-1990s, about one-quarter of all exits came through an IPO.16 In 2016, there were only 30 \nIPOs of private-equity backed companies in the U.S., the lowest level since 2009. There has been an average \nof 46 IPOs per year by private equity firms in the past decade, less than 10 percent of all exits.17  \n \nA sale to another corporate buyer remains the most popular selling strategy, accounting for more than one-\nhalf of exits, followed by a sale to another buyout fund, which accounts for about 40 percent of exits in recent \nyears. This is up from 10 percent in 1996.18 Companies that are delisting are not returning to the ranks of the \nlisted, contributing to the listing gap. \n \nA failure to maintain a minimum level of assets or market capitalization is the leading reason for a delisting for \ncause. This is followed by a stock price that falls below a price threshold, usually $1.00. Bankruptcy also leads \nto delisting. There were bankruptcy waves in the early 1990s, early 2000s, and surrounding the financial crisis \nof 2008 and 2009.19   \n  \nThe fall in the number of listed companies has major consequences from an investor\u2019s point of view. Investors \nhave less access to companies that are owned by private equity firms or that remain private. Further, those \ncompanies that remain public are older and more profitable than they were 20 years ago and compete in \nindustries that are more concentrated.  \n \nEven as the investable universe has dwindled since 1996, the sophistication of investors has marched steadily \nhigher in the past 40 years. While less than 20 percent of stocks were owned by institutions in 1976, a \nmajority are today. Direct ownership by individuals shows the mirror image, dropping from 50 percent to 21 \npercent over the same period. There are fewer public companies in which to invest, those that are accessible \nare more mature, and the population of investors is vastly more informed than four decades ago. \n \nThe substantial M&A activity in the past 20 years has increased concentration in three-quarters of U.S. \nindustries that create products.20 The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a popular method to estimate \nindustry concentration. The HHI considers not only the number of firms but also the distribution of the sizes of \nfirms. A dominant firm in an otherwise fragmented industry may be able to impose discipline on others. In \nindustries with several firms of similar size, rivalry tends to be intense. 21 The higher the HHI, the higher the \ndegree of concentration. \n \nThe HHI for public firms in the U.S. was more than 1,000 in 1976, dropped to about 800 in 1996, and rose \nto roughly 1,200 in 2016.22 Forces behind the rise in the HHI include more lax antitrust enforcement and \nhigher barriers to entry in some markets. The pattern is consistent even if you take into consideration private \nand foreign companies and is not solely the result of distressed industries consolidating.23 \n \nAs a result of M&A, listed companies are now older and larger. The average age of a company measured from \nthe time of listing is currently 18 years old, up from 12 years old in 1996. Today\u2019s mean market capitalization \nis almost $7 billion, more than 10 times the size of the typical company in 1976 measured in constant dollars. \nThe minimum market capitalization to enter the S&P 500 Index is now $6.1 billion. \n \n"

The ratio of dividends and share repurchases divided by net income, or total payout ratio, is \ntoday 2.3 times what it was in 1996 and 1.7 times that of 1976.24   \n \nThe reduction in the number of companies has also led to higher profitability.25 Exhibit 6 shows the cash flow \nreturn on investment (CFROI\u00ae\uf02a), a measure of corporate return on investment that is adjusted for inflation, for \na large sample of U.S. companies. The average CFROI from 1976 to 1996 was 5.5 percent and rose to 9.1 \npercent from 1997-2016.

The average number of IPOs was 282 per \nyear from 1976 through 2000. Since then, the average has been 114.

Ritter; Thomson Reuters; Copeland, Koller, and Murrin.  \n \nWhat is striking is a recent, and marked, divergence between M&A volume and IPO proceeds. Specifically, \nthe correlation between the two was 0.87 from 1976 to 2000, but dropped to 0.12 from 2001 to 2016. \nSince the financial crisis, from 2007 to 2016, the correlation is -0.08. M&A is flourishing and IPOs are \nfloundering.  \n \nOne potential explanation for the drop in IPOs is simply that business dynamism has been on the decline in the \nU.S. For example, 712,000 new establishments launched in the U.S. in 1996 and only 670,000 did so in \n2016, despite the fact that today the GDP is almost 60 percent larger and there are 20 percent more people. \nIndeed, fewer new establishments were started in 2016 than in 1976. Establishments less than 1 year old \ncreated 4.4 million jobs in 1996 and around 3 million in 2015.29 \n \nThe data suggest that eligible companies do not see a net benefit in listing via an IPO. There are likely a few \nexplanations for this.  \n \nFirst, the cost of being public has gone up, which means that it makes sense only for larger companies to list. \nThe population of companies eligible to list falls as the size threshold rises. As a consequence, the median age \nof a company seeking to go public has risen. The magnitude of late-stage funding also contributes to this \ntrend. Exhibit 9 shows the median age of companies doing an IPO was 7.8 years old from 1976 to 1996 and \n10.7 years old from 1997-2016, a 37 percent increase. If we extend the prior period to include the dot-com \nboom, the median age of listings has risen 50 percent from 1976-2000 to 2001-2016.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\nM&A Volume ($ Billions)\nIPO Proceeds ($Billions)\nIPO Proceeds\nM&A Volume\n"

Ritter. \n \nSecond, companies today need less human and physical capital than they did in prior generations. For \nexample, Facebook\u2019s sales per employee were $1.6 million in 2016 whereas Ford\u2019s were $755,000. In 2016, \nAmazon.com generated $136 billion of sales using invested capital of $19 billion, a capital velocity ratio of 7.1 \ntimes, while Wal-Mart\u2019s sales of $486 billion required $135 billion of invested capital, or capital velocity of 3.6 \ntimes.30     \n \nThird, private companies can now obtain ample later-stage venture capital funding. For example, the five \nstartup companies with the highest implied valuations have raised a combined total exceeding $28 billion in the \nlast few years. These companies need less capital than their predecessors did but have access to more of it.   \n \nFinally, access to liquidity allows the employees of private companies to sell shares. For instance, it was \nreported that Airbnb Inc.\u2019s financing round in the fall of 2016, which raised $850 million and valued the \ncompany at $30 billion, allowed employees to sell $200 million of stock.31 This liquidity is the result of the \nunprecedented ability to raise late-stage venture capital.  \n \nThere are a couple of meaningful consequences to these trends. To begin, there are a lot of private \ncompanies that are valuable on paper but that are not yet public. According to The Wall Street Journal, as of \nMarch 2017 there are 155 companies with a value in excess of $1 billion. This is nearly triple the 54 such \ncompanies in March 2014.  \n \nAppendix B provides a list of these companies, commonly called \u201cunicorns,\u201d and shows that they have a total \nvalue of $585 billion as of mid-March, 2017.32  Most of the companies at this stage of development would \nhave sought an IPO twenty years ago, encouraged by their venture capital backers. \n \nCompanies today are building a great deal of value pre-IPO versus post-IPO. This means that investors who \ndo not have access to venture capital are missing substantial gains. Take three companies as an example: \nAmazon.com, Alphabet Inc. (Google), and Facebook (see exhibit 10).  \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\nNumber of Years\nAverage\nAverage\n"

Google went public 6 years after founding at a value \nof $29 billion, and its investors have made 20 times their money.

It is virtually impossible for \nFacebook investors to earn the same total shareholder return as Amazon.com shareholders did over 20 years.   \n \nBill Gurley, a general partner at Benchmark Capital, urges caution when considering current events. He points \nout that venture capital funds are posting attractive returns even as IPOs are moribund (there were only 39 \nventure-backed IPOs in 2016). The venture capitalists fund entrepreneurs and then the companies raise funds \nfrom late-stage investors, allowing the VCs to mark up the company\u2019s value.

The downside is that it is hard to make these types of investments at scale \nand very few public market investors have experience investing in young companies. That said, there is \nevidence to show that large investment firms that have invested directly in private equity have fared relatively \nwell.37 \n \nOne final challenge for investment firms investing in startups is that valuations are hard to establish. For \nexample, mutual fund companies commonly mark the same illiquid position at different values.38 As a case in \npoint, T.

There was a steady rise in \nspin-offs from 1976 through the dot-com boom in 2000, followed by a sharp collapse in the first decade of \nthe 2000s. In recent years, spin-off activity has picked up again with a peak in 2014. There were 35 spin-offs \nin 2016 versus 60 in 2014.

More than 70 percent of wagers today are \nknown as exotics, which involve wagers on the extended order of finish in a particular race or the winners of \nconsecutive races. For example, a handicapper may wager on which horses will finish 1-2, or 1-2-3. The \noutcomes from these wagers derive from more complex race results.39     \n \nOver that same period, there has been rapid growth in derivatives in the U.S. equity market. The Black-\nScholes option pricing model was published in 1973, and 32.4 million equity options traded at the Chicago \nBoard of Exchange in 1976. That volume was roughly 6 times higher in 1996, reaching 191 million options \ntraded. But the real explosion happened in the last 20 years. In 2016, equity options volume was 3.6 billion, \n19 times what it was 20 years before. \n \nThe growth in equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which derive their value from the basket of stocks they \nreflect, has also been explosive and has offset the listing gap in part.40 Created in 1993, an ETF is an \ninvestment fund that trades on an exchange similar to a stock. The ETF holds assets that typically track an \nindex, stocks within a sector, stocks that exhibit certain factors, bonds, or commodities. In principle, the ETF \nis supposed to trade close to the net asset value of the securities it is tracking. About one-fifth of the assets \nunder management for ETFs track traditional indexes such as the S&P 500. \n \nETFs trade all day, unlike mutual funds which are priced once a day, can be bought and sold through a broker, \nand are more tax efficient than traditional mutual funds because they trigger fewer \u201ctax events.\u201d In 1996, \nETFs of U.S. domiciled equity funds had assets under management of just $2 billion. That sum has grown to \n$1.8 trillion in 2016. \n \nExhibit 15 shows that the number of equity ETFs in the U.S. went from 1 in 1993 to 658 in 2016. These are \na net sum, as it is common for new ETFs to be listed and others delisted in a given year. ETFs started to gain \nin popularity right around the time that the population of listed stocks started dropping. \n \nExhibit 15: Number of Equity ETFs in the U.S.  \n \nSource: Strategic Insight. \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nNumber of ETFs\n"

Trading in ETFs is very concentrated. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust \nalone has averaged about 9 percent of the volume on the New York Stock Exchange over the past five years, \nand 20 ETFs make up about 90 percent of ETF trading volume.  \n \nThat ETFs are such a large part of the market likely represents both an opportunity and a risk. The opportunity \nis to use ETFs as an effective way to hedge or gain quick exposure to the market, a sector, or a factor. The \nrisk is that ETFs may impede price discovery if they become too prominent.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3,000\n3,500\n4,000\n4,500\n5,000\n5,500\n6,000\n6,500\n7,000\n7,500\n8,000\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\nNumber\nListed Firms + ETFs\nListed Firms\n"

      "text": " \n \nMarch 22, 2017 \nThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks \n20 \nExhibit 17: ETFs as a Percentage of Equity Trading in the U.S.  \n \nSource: Credit Suisse Trading Strategy. \n \nSummary  \n \nThe number of listed companies in the U.S. rose 50 percent from 1976 to 1996 and fell 50 percent from \n1996 to 2016. This has not happened in other parts of the world, opening a U.S. listing gap. This is important \nbecause the U.S. comprises one-half of the value of the world\u2019s stock market.   \n \nA company\u2019s decision to list involves weighing costs and benefits. Net benefits appeared to be positive in the \nfirst 20 years of this period and have turned negative in the last 20 years. As a result, delistings have \nexceeded new listings by a large margin since 1996. \n \nRegulation appears to have played a role in two ways. The cost of being public, especially after the \nimplementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, has risen in the past two decades. That said, the \nshrinkage in the population of listed companies started well before that law was implemented. Further, \nrelatively accommodative anti-trust enforcement allowed for robust M&A activity. \n \nAs a result, listed companies today are on average larger, older, and more profitable than they were 20 years \nago. Further, they operate in industries that are generally more concentrated. The overall size and maturity of \nlisted companies means they are more likely to pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and \nshare buybacks than companies were in the past. \n \nWe speculate that the maturation of listed companies has also contributed to informational efficiency in the \nstock market. Gaining edge in older and well established businesses is likely more difficult than it is in young \nbusinesses with uncertain outlooks. In turn, the greater efficiency may be one of the catalysts for the shift that \ninvestors are making from active to indexed or rule-based strategies.42   \n \n \n \n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n2000\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nPercentage of Value Traded\n"

      "text": " \n \nMarch 22, 2017 \nThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks \n21 \nThe chief investment officer (CIO) of an institution in the mid-1970s could gain reasonable exposure to U.S. \nequities by investing in an early stage venture fund and a large market index such as the S&P 500 (itself not \nan easy thing to do at the time). Today, that CIO needs to participate in early- and late-stage venture capital, a \nprivate equity buyout fund, and the S&P 500. Only a few investors have access to all of these alternatives. \n \nThe universe of alternative investments, including venture capital, buyout funds, and hedge funds, has grown \nsharply in the past 20 years to provide some investors with access to more investment opportunities as well as \nto employ more sophisticated methods to generate excess returns. The growth of these asset classes has led \nto lower returns for investors.  \n \nVenture capital funds launched in the 1990s outperformed public markets. But funds started since 2000 have \nunderperformed public markets, with an improvement in recent years. Buyout funds with vintage years before \n2006 outperformed public markets, but those launched in the last decade have only equaled the returns of the \nmarket. Hedge funds have also seen diminishing excess returns in the past decade.43 The difference between \nthe top and bottom performers is larger in venture capital than in buyout funds. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The source financial statement, pricing, and \nearnings data provided by outside data vendors are subject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying \neconomics of firm performance. These adjustments provide consistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies \nacross industries or national borders. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT valuation model establishes the baseline \nvaluation for a security, and a user then may adjust the default variables to produce alternative scenarios, any of which could occur. Additional \ninformation about the Credit Suisse HOLT methodology is available on request. \nThe Credit Suisse HOLT methodology does not assign a price target to a security. The default scenario that is produced by the Credit Suisse HOLT \nvaluation model establishes a warranted price for a security, and as the third-party data are updated, the warranted price may also change. The default \nvariables may also be adjusted to produce alternative warranted prices, any of which could occur.
