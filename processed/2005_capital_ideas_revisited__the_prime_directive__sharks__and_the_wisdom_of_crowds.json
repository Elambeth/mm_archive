Substantial evidence \nsuggests that active institutional managers in the aggregate add little or no value versus passive index \nfunds. Without some sense of how and why markets are efficient or inefficient, investors have no sound \nreason to believe they can systematically deliver superior returns. \n \nWe offer a framework to understand market efficiency based on the theory of complex adaptive systems. \nThe framework also offers insight into market inefficiency and how a long-term investor should try to take \nadvantage of inefficiency. Along the way, we show how developments in standard finance theory, \nbehavioral finance, experimental economics, and prediction markets fit into the complex adaptive system \nframework. \n \nHere are the key points: \n \n\u2022 \nWe evaluate standard finance\u2019s three approaches to explaining market efficiency: rational agents, \nindependent errors, and no-arbitrage. We argue that the rational agent and no-arbitrage arguments \nrest on questionable assumptions and offer predictions that don\u2019t square with the empirical facts.  \n \n\u2022 \nA complex adaptive systems approach to markets is based on the large-scale behaviors that \nemerge from the interaction of a heterogeneous group of investors. We suggest the conditions \nunder which markets are efficient and inefficient, and note the stylized predictions of the complex \nsystems approach.  \n \n\u2022 \nThe booming behavioral finance movement has much to offer. Investors, however, must be careful \nto avoid the reductionist trap and study psychology on a collective, not individual, basis. Suboptimal \ndecisions by individuals do not suggest an inefficient market unless the errors are non-\nindependent.  \n \n\u2022 \nExperimental economics shows that markets can attain competitive equilibrium with surprisingly \nweak assumptions about agent knowledge, and that bubbles and crashes occur under certain \ncircumstances.  \n \n\u2022 \nThe statistical properties of markets\u2014what market results look like\u2014are consistent with a complex \nsystems approach but appear contrary to much that the standard theory predicts.

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \n3 \nIntroduction \n \nMarket efficiency is a very important topic for active investment managers. Without a clear understanding of \nhow and why markets are efficient or inefficient, investors have no foundation for establishing an \ninvestment strategy.  To win a game, you must understand the rules.  \n \nStill, very few active investors think carefully about market efficiency. Most investors take market \ninefficiency for granted\u2014their professional \u201creason to be\u201d depends on it\u2014but have very little to substantiate \ntheir perception. Some sense of how and why markets are, or can become, inefficient provides insight on \nways to generate better-than-expected risk-adjusted results. \n \nPractioners must logically believe that markets exist between the extremes of pure efficiency and \ninefficiency. Markets that are always inefficient are a mug\u2019s game, because an investor has no assurance \nthat the difference between price and value will vanish. Conversely, perfectly efficient markets afford no \nopportunity for excess returns.    \n \nThe debate over market efficiency tends to break into two broad camps. The first camp, which includes \nmost financial economists and passive money managers, argues for market efficiency\u2014security prices fully \nreflect all available information.1 The most lethal arrow in the market efficiency quiver is the overwhelming \nevidence that most active managers underperform passive indexes over time. 2 \n \nA sizable majority of active managers and a smaller percentage of academics\u2014especially those involved \nwith behavioral finance\u2014comprise the second camp. This group suggests that prices periodically deviate \nsubstantially from warranted value. Believers marshal evidence from a host of anomalies, including booms, \ncrashes, and a handful of investors who have consistently beat the market over time.  \n \nIn his famous book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn wrote, \u201cAnomaly appears only \nagainst the background provided by the paradigm.\u201d 3 The construction of modern finance theory, which \nPeter Bernstein\u2019s Capital Ideas documents beautifully, plays a crucial role in how we frame the market \nefficiency debate today. Since the terms of today\u2019s debate are an artifact of the theory\u2019s intellectual path, we \nwill look critically at how neoclassical finance developed along with its explicit and implicit assumptions. In \nthe end, we will argue that the standard theory is in its twilight. We already have richer ways to think about \nmarkets that are descriptively more robust and truer to empirical results.      \n    \nThis is not to say that we should not celebrate the contributions of our finance fathers, including Louis \nBachelier, Harry Markowitz, Paul Samuelson, William Sharpe, James Tobin, Merton Miller, Franco \nModigliani, Eugene Fama, Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton (this group has amassed \neight Nobel prizes). They created theory to explain important phenomena in financial economics, and their \ntheories immediately became touchstones. Without a solid theoretical foundation as a basis to compare \nresults, a scientific field will not advance. \n \nIn the first part of this essay, we look at standard finance\u2019s approaches to explaining market efficiency. As \nwe will see, two of the three main approaches to explain efficiency rest on dubious assumptions, and more \nsignificantly, make predictions the empirical results do not substantiate.  \n \nNext, we look at a complex adaptive systems approach to markets. Complex systems consider the large-\nscale behaviors that emerge from the interaction of a heterogeneous group of agents. A complex systems \napproach describes a market mechanism\u2014how we get to market results. From social insects, to \nexperimental economics, to decision markets, to stock markets, we will look at a host of collective \nphenomena and see under what conditions they generate good and poor results. Here, too, we consider \nthe role of behavioral finance and provide high-level predictions of complex systems theory.  \n \nFinally, we look at the statistical properties of markets\u2014what market results look like. Certain statistical \nfeatures, like large-scale changes, are endogenous to many complex systems, a topic that also bears directly \non a discussion of risk.  \n \nIn a future piece, we will turn to a more practical question: if a complex adaptive system approach is the \nright way to understand markets, how can active investors beat the market?   \n"

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \n4 \nThe Prime Directive and Sharks \n \nI believe there is no other proposition in economics which has more solid empirical evidence supporting it \nthan the Efficient Market Hypothesis. \n \nMichael C. Jensen \nSome Anomalous Evidence Regarding Market Efficiency 4 \n \nIn his excellent book, Inefficient Markets, Andrei Shleifer describes the three arguments that comprise the \ntheoretical foundation for market efficiency. The assumptions underlying these arguments become less \nrestrictive as you go down the list: 5  \n \n1. Investor rationality. The models here assume that investors are rational, which means they \ncorrectly update their beliefs when new information is available and make normatively acceptable \nchoices given expected utility theory.6  \n2. The random errors of investors cancel out. This model does allow investors to make errors, but \nassumes these errors are independent. The errors cancel out, leaving an efficient result. (Pierre-\nSimon LaPlace and Simeon-Denis Poisson used this idea to describe how a distribution of errors \naround celestial observations distilled to an accurate number. 7)  \n3. Arbitrage. Even if all investors are not rational, a small set of rational investors use arbitrage to \nremove pricing errors. So the average investor doesn\u2019t matter; the marginal investor sets prices. \n \nIn the short time between 1952 and 1973, a handful of researchers devised the theories that form finance\u2019s \nbedrock. These theories rely largely on the rational agent and arbitrage argument. A very brief synopsis \nfollows: \n \nMean/variance efficiency. According to mean-variance efficiency, investors rationally trade-off risk and \nreturn in a linear fashion. Markowitz (1952) first showed how to optimize the risk/reward tradeoff in a \nportfolio. Sharpe (1964), John Lintner (1965), and Jan Mossin (1966) extended the concept into the capital \nasset pricing model (CAPM), which extended Markowitz while offering much more computational \nsimplicity.8 \n \nArbitrage. Modigliani and Miller (1958) used an arbitrage argument to show that, under certain conditions, a \nfirm\u2019s value is independent of its capital structure. Milton Friedman (1953) made the arbitrage case in the \ncontext of markets, arguing that rational investors would rapidly reverse the dislocations created by \nirrational investors. Arbitrage is also a central component of Fama\u2019s (1965) case that stock price changes \nare independent, pertinent for the efficient market hypothesis.  \n \nLater, Black and Scholes (1973) developed their eponymous options pricing model on the idea of arbitrage. \nOption models generally rely on a replicating portfolio, a mix of securities that replicates the option\u2019s payoff. \nA no-arbitrage condition is a critical assumption in the model. \n \nThese two approaches are fundamentally different. The rational model relies on notions of general \nequilibrium and is an absolute pricing model. In contrast, the arbitrage approach is a relative pricing model \nand doesn\u2019t ask where the prices came from. About arbitrage, physicist-cum-quant Emanuel Derman \nquipped, \u201cIf you want to know the value of a security, use the value of a similar security, and compare. \nEverything else is commentary.\u201d In reality, many models blend the two approaches to best solve a given \nproblem. 9  \n \nWe can easily see how combining rational agents and arbitrage makes for a powerful one-two punch. If we \nassume rational agents, we get the right price. But even with non-rational agents, (in violation of \nmean/variance efficiency), enough arbitrageurs are around to make the market look as if it\u2019s rational. \n \nDidier Sornette, in his sweeping and provocative book Why Stock Markets Crash, notes, \u201cthe no-arbitrage \ncondition together with rational expectations is not a mechanism. It does not explain its own origin.\u201d 10 This \ndistinction is vital, because even if these arguments help to describe the outcome of the market \nmechanism, they do not describe the mechanism itself.  \n \nLet\u2019s look more critically at these two arguments. \n"

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \n5 \n \nPerhaps no single concept is more central in neoclassical economics and finance than the assumption of \nagent rationality. Financial economist Mark Rubinstein explains: 11 \n \nWhen I went to financial economist training school, I was taught The Prime Directive . . . Whatever \nelse I would do, I should follow The Prime Directive:  Explain asset prices by rational models. Only \nif all attempts fail, resort to irrational investor behavior.  (Emphasis original.) \n \nWhere did the idea of rational agents come from? We can trace today\u2019s finance theory back to 19th century \nphysics. In the preface to Handbook of The Economics of Finance, editors George Constantinides, Milton \nHarris, and Rene Stulz explain, \u201cthe modern quantitative approach to finance has its origins in neoclassical \neconomics.\u201d 12 Economist and science historian Philip Mirowski continues the link, \u201cneoclassical [economic] \ntheory was directly copied from mid-nineteenth-century energy physics.\u201d 13 \n \nSpecifically, late-19th-century economists equated preferences (or utility) with potential energy, allowing \nthem to adopt the physics models. Mirowski suggests the economists imitated physics based on their \nmotivation to make economics \u201cintrinsically scientific\u201d, and the models they adopted embraced the \nprevailing deterministic views of that day.  \n \nThe problem, he argues, is that utility and energy are fundamentally different principles. Conservation \nprinciples in physics have no straightforward analog in economics. Mirowski suggests, \u201cThis suppressed \nconservation principle, forgetting the conservation of energy while simultaneously appealing to the \nmetaphor of energy, is the Achilles heel of all neoclassical economic theory, the point at which the physical \nanalogy breaks down irreparably.\u201d   \n \nMirowski\u2019s in-depth study of the link between physics and economics reflects poorly on the economists. Yet \nthe physics-inspired models remain the bread and butter of many economists. He continues, \u201cEconomists \nhave consistently lagged behind physicists in developing and elaborating metaphors; they have freeloaded \noff of physicists for their inspiration, and appropriated it in a shoddy and slipshod manner.\u201d 14 \n \nThe extremity of the rational agent assumption has not been lost on financial economists. But as Friedman \nargues, the real test of a theory is not the realism of its assumptions but the quality of its predictions. By this \nstandard, the rational agent model is wounded.  \n \nOne of classic finance\u2019s predictions is very limited trading activity. As a practical matter, this prediction \nlands wildly off the mark. In a recent survey of asset pricing, financial economist John Cochrane states the \npoint directly: 15 \n \nThe classic theory of finance has no volume at all: Prices adjust until investors are happy to \ncontinue doing what they were doing all along, holding the market portfolio. Simple modifications \nsuch as lifecycle and rebalancing motives don\u2019t come near to explaining observed volume. Put \nbluntly, the classic theory of finance predicts that the NYSE and NASDAQ do not exist. \n \nFurther, empirical tests of mean/variance efficiency have questioned its predictive value. Fama and French \n(1992), for example, flatly assert, \u201ctests do not support the most basic prediction of the SLB [Sharpe-Linter-\nBlack] model, that average returns are positively related to the market\u2019s.\u201d In a follow up paper (2004), they \nadd, \u201cthe empirical record of the [SLB] model is poor\u2014poor enough to invalidate the way it is used in \napplications.\u201d \n \nEven outright rejection of the rational agent model doesn\u2019t suggest inefficient markets if the no-arbitrage \ncondition prevails. A leading advocate for the no-arbitrage case is Stephen Ross. He summarizes the case \nas follows: 16 \n \nI, for one, never thought that people\u2014myself included\u2014were all rational in their behavior. To the \ncontrary, I am always amazed at what people do. But, that was never the point of financial theory. \n \nThe absence of arbitrage requires that there be enough well financed and smart investors to close \narbitrage opportunities when they appear . . . Neoclassical finance is a theory of sharks and not a \ntheory of rational homo economicus, and that is the principal distinction between finance and \n"

In most economic models aggregate demand depends on average demand \nand for that reason, traditional economic theories require the average individual to be rational. In \nliquid securities markets, though, profit opportunities bring about infinite discrepancies between \ndemand and supply. Well financed arbitrageurs spot these opportunities, pile on, and by their \nactions they close aberrant price differentials. Rational finance . . . has worked very hard to rid the \nfield of its sensitivity to the psychological vagaries of investors. (Emphasis added.) \n \nArbitrage is the purchase and sale of the same or equivalent security in order to profit from price \ndiscrepancies. Naturally, arbitrage has many flavors. In its purest form, arbitrage is buying and selling an \nidentical asset for profit, a riskless venture. Event-driven arbitrage, a riskier venture, includes purchase and \nsales of the company securities involved in a merger or acquisition. Statistical arbitrage uses past asset \nprice relationships to seek investment opportunities.  Finally, arbitrageurs also get responsibility for driving \nout any price inefficiency\u2014or profit opportunity\u2014in the market. Since the first forms of arbitrage are \nrelatively rare, markets require the latter types to stay efficient.       \n \nWe do not question that markets are highly competitive and that investors seek profit opportunities. As \nSanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz (1980) point out, there must be \u201csufficient profit opportunities, i.e., \ninefficiencies, to compensate investors for the cost of trading and information-gathering.\u201d 17 While they \nargue that there are some returns for investors, they suggest that the rewards investors gather are \ncommensurate with the costs they bear. Investors clearly seek and exploit obvious profit opportunities \n(which is why they are so rare).   \n \nThere\u2019s also no question that some investors have greater influence than others, if only because they have \naccess to more capital. Practically, the no-arbitrage assumption is useful as a first-order approximation of \nreality. But the assumption that some, instead of all, investors are rational remains fundamentally \nproblematic. \n \nJack Treynor (1987) cites two conceptual problems. First, as arbitrageurs expand their positions to capture \nprice-to-value discrepancies, portfolio risk rises faster than portfolio demand. After a point, adding to the \nposition is irrational for a rational, risk-adverse investor. Second, and more basic, the argument \u201cassumes \nthat those investors who are right know they are right, while those who are wrong know they are wrong\u2014an \nunlikely state of affairs.\u201d18  \n \nIn addition, as a practical matter the arbitrageurs simply fail to act at critical junctures in markets. The \nevents surrounding the 1998 collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) provide a recent \nexample. Sociologist Donald MacKenzie notes: 19  \n \nAs \u201cspreads\u201d widened, and thus arbitrage opportunities grew more attractive, arbitrageurs did not \nmove into the market, narrowing spreads and restoring \u201cnormality.\u201d Instead, potential arbitrageurs \ncontinued to flee, widening the spreads and intensifying the problems of those who remained, such \nas LTCM. \n \nOur very brief discussion of the rational agent and no-arbitrage arguments in support of market efficiency \nreveal weak underlying assumptions and, much more damaging, predictions that the empirical facts refute. \nNone of this is to say that it\u2019s easy to outwit markets. Both approaches imply that most investors have little \nor no chance of systematically beating the market, a point difficult to dispute.  \n \nIf the major conclusion of the rational agent and no-arbitrage approaches makes sense, why look \nelsewhere?  We contend that the second approach to understanding market efficiency (the aggregation of \ninvestors with independent errors) provides the most promise, even though it has been largely dismissed or \nignored by economists\u2014including the behavioral finance crowd. 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The idea that a city could acquire its pattern as naturally as a snowflake was foreign to \nthem. They reacted to it as many Christian fundamentalists responded to Darwin: no design without a \nDesigner! \n \nHerbert A. Simon \nThe Sciences of the Artificial 21 \n \nThe aggregation of investors is an example of a complex adaptive system. All complex adaptive systems \nhave three features in common. First is a group of heterogeneous agents with local information. The \nheterogeneity arises from varying decision rules, which evolve over time. Second is an aggregation \nmechanism that leads to emergent behavior. An example of aggregation is the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s \ndouble-auction market. Finally, there is a global system\u2014in our case, the stock market.  \n \nOne of the key lessons of complex adaptive systems is that you can\u2019t understand the whole by adding up \nthe parts. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. As a result, reductionism doesn\u2019t work.  \n \nThis is crucial because many people attempt to understand the markets by talking to individuals. If markets \nare an emergent phenomenon, individual agents will provide little or no understanding of the workings on \nthe market level.   \n \nWe will review some of the work on collectives, starting with social insects, moving on to simple human \nexamples, experimental economics, and decision markets. We\u2019ll then discuss how these ideas apply to the \nstock market, and how the burgeoning behavioral finance field fits into the picture.  \n \nSocial insects, including ants and bees, give us a wonderful example of complex adaptive systems at work \nand demonstrate how collectives can function effectively without leaders. As Thomas Seeley writes in his \ndelightful book, The Wisdom of the Hive: 22 \n \nThe most thought-provoking feature of a honey bee colony is its ability to achieve coordinated \nactivity among tens of thousands of bees without central control. \n \nCoherence in honey bee colonies depends . . . upon mechanisms of decentralized control which \ngive rise to natural selection processes . . . analogous to those that create order in the natural world \nand in the competitive market economies of humans.  \n \nOur discussion begins with the animal world for three reasons. First is to show that collectives can solve \ncomplex economic problems in nature without leaders and with local information only. 23 Second, we want \nto underscore how this decentralized notion runs counterintuitive to our deeply human desire to link cause \nand effect. Notwithstanding the rise in markets over the last few hundred years, the vast majority of human \neconomic activity occurs inside businesses and other organizations where cause and effect remains \nreasonably clear. 24  \n \nFinally, the results of evolutionary processes often mimic textbook predictions. Writes neuroscientist Paul \nGlimcher, \u201cthere is a significant amount of evidence suggesting that when we can identify what constitutes \nan optimal solution, animals come remarkably close to achieving those optimal solutions.\u201d 25 (You could say \nthat natural selection acts as an arbitrageur, albeit over very long time scales.) \n \nA wonderful assimilation of the work on collectives is James Surowiecki\u2019s The Wisdom of Crowds. \nSurowiecki shows how a collection of individuals can outperform experts in case after case. Significantly \nthough, Surowiecki makes some careful distinctions. First, he specifies the conditions under which \ncollectives work well, including diversity, independence, and aggregation. We prefer to collapse the first two \nand add incentives. \n \nCollectives tend to outperform individuals when you have: \n \n"

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \n8 \n\u2022 \nDiversity. Investors have diverse decision rules. Investors take information from the environment, \ncombine it with their own interaction with the environment, and derive decision rules. Various \ndecision rules compete with one another based on their fitness, with the most effective surviving. \nThis process is adaptive. 26 Investors differ in their information, time horizons, and approach (e.g., \ntechnical versus fundamental).  \n\u2022 \nAggregation mechanism. Markets provide a generally effective mechanism for aggregating \ndisparate views. However, aggregation requires sufficient information.  \n\u2022 \nIncentives. Collectives work better when the individuals have some incentive to be right. These \nincentives need not be monetary.  \n \nSecond, Surowiecki specifies the types of problems where collectives tend to do better than experts. \nExperts generally outperform collectives in closed systems. For example, an airplane pilot is likely to be \nmore effective flying a plane because flying consists mostly of rule-based procedures. But when the \nproblem has sufficient complexity, collectives consistently outperform experts. \n \nLet\u2019s look at some examples of how collectives solve problems. \n \nThe first set of problems collectives solve well is estimating current states\u2014be it how many jelly beans are \nin a jar, the best path through a maze, or the location of a missing item.  \n  \nOne example of this current-state problem solving is crater classification. In 2000, NASA launched the \nClickworkers program to test whether distributed human volunteers were willing and able to classify and \nmark Mars craters. 27 Over a six-month period 85,000 people visited the web site and submitted almost 2 \nmillion crater-marking entries. While the participants were diverse, they first had to take a brief tutorial.  \n \nThe result? The website reports that \u201cthe automatically-computed consensus of a large number of \nclickworkers is virtually indistinguishable from the inputs of a geologist with years of experience in \nidentifying Mars craters.\u201d Notwithstanding limited experience and varying backgrounds, the program found \nsuccess. Even worries about outliers were misplaced: the site notes that the \u201cfrivolous inputs\u201d the project \nreceived were \u201ceasily weeded out.\u201d  \n \nNot all examples of collective problem solving are new. In Moby-Dick, Herman Melville mentions that Navy \nlieutenant M.F. Maury used collectives to track the movement of sperm whales. The primary goal of \nMaury\u2019s 1851 book, Explanation and Sailing Directions, was not whale tracking but \u201cto put within reach of \nthe young and inexperienced mariner, a summary of the experience of thousands of voyages.\u201d  \n \nHow Maury helped sailors was \u201cto point out those tracks on the great ocean, where the results of carefully \ncollated observations, selected from many and divers [sic] sources, show where you are most likely to find \nfair winds and favorable currents.\u201d 28 While apparently never completing the work on whales, Maury \ngrasped the value of aggregating diverse experiences to find optimal sailing paths.      \n \nOne objection to these illustrations, as well as some that Surowiecki uses, is their perceived failure to \naddress fundamental economic issues. In 2002, the Nobel committee awarded a prize in economic \nsciences to Vernon Smith \u201cfor having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic \nanalysis.\u201d Smith has led the movement in experimental economics, a means to test outcomes under \ncontrolled conditions.   \n \nExperimental economics remains controversial because many of the experiments are deemed too \nunrealistic (for example, students instead of business people serve as subjects) or too simple (the real \nworld is much messier than what the experiments can reflect). Notwithstanding these criticisms, \nexperimental methods inform us of at least two significant principles. First, markets can attain competitive \nequilibrium with surprisingly weak assumptions about agent knowledge. Second, bubbles and crashes \noccur under certain circumstances. 29 \n \nAs a young professor at Purdue, Smith set up a class experiment to \u201cbuild the strongest possible case \nagainst the Law of Supply and Demand.\u201d The results of his experiment \u201cstunned\u201d him: he found that the \nmarket worked much as the economic textbooks claimed it should. 30  \n \n"

Experiments show that when prices start \nbelow intrinsic value and rise, the price momentum can carry them beyond proper value.  \n \nThe second factor is the cash availability. Making more cash available to investors increases the likelihood \nand size of bubbles. Also, bubbles tend to pop rather than deflate slowly.  34  \n \nSo experimental markets show results that appear consistent with the real world: markets are generally \nefficient but periodically go through bubbles and crashes. Do these experimental results translate into the \nfield? 35  \n \nDecision markets, also known as prediction markets, are relevant progeny of experimental economics and \ntake us a step closer to the stock market. Unlike the collective wisdom examples that estimate current \nstates, decision markets make predictions about the future. Online markets include the Hollywood Stock \nExchange (www.hsx.com), BetFair (www.betfair.com), Intrade (www.intrade.com) and TradeSports \n(www.tradesports.com).  Since these are typically winner-take-all markets, the price reflects the probability \nof an outcome. 36  \n \nThe best-known decision market is the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM, www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem). In the four \nU.S. presidential elections through 2000, IEM predicted the vote percentages with an absolute average \nerror nearly 30% less than that of national polls. 37 Both the IEM and NewsFutures (www.newsfutures.com) \nmarkets accurately predicted the outcome of the 2004 U.S. election.  \n \nAnother online market, Centrebet, (www.centrebet.com) provided keen insight into Australia\u2019s 2004 Prime \nMinister elections. On the eve of the election, the news polls had the candidates running neck-and-neck, \nwhile the prices on Centrebet strongly suggested a John Howard victory. Howard won easily. 38   \n \nThese are not isolated examples. In their survey of prediction markets, Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz \n(2004) show that \u201cmarket-generated forecasts are typically fairly accurate, and that they outperform most \nmoderately sophisticated benchmarks.\u201d 39 \n \n"

First, these markets generally deal with \ndiscrete outcomes. Second, these contracts have finite time horizons. In contrast, stock markets are \ncontinuous and perpetual. As a result, you are less likely to see speculation in a decision market because \nresults occur within a defined period.  \n \nWe can pause at this point and consolidate the message. A survey of collective problem solving\u2014from \nsocial insects to state estimation to experimental economics to decision markets\u2014reveals that when certain \nconditions are in place, collectives tend to be very effective (or efficient). We can achieve many of these \nresults with surprisingly simple assumptions about agent knowledge or behavior. While many of these \napproaches do not preclude arbitrageurs, none of them require arbitrageurs to achieve efficiency.       \n \nHow does behavioral finance fit into this picture? We can think of behavioral finance on two levels: \nindividual and collective. The individual level focuses on how people behave in ways that do not conform to \neconomic theory and how they are consistently subject to biases arising from the use of heuristics. Many of \nthe ideas on suboptimal individual behavior are part of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky\u2019s prospect \ntheory.40  \n \nThe collective level deals with how people interact with one another, or more accurately how people change \ntheir decision rules based on the influence of others. The collective encompasses not only the wisdom of \ncrowds, but also the whims of crowds: particularly the genesis of fads, fashions, information contagions, \nand herding. 41  \n \nWhen we look at market efficiency through the complex adaptive system lens, we should clearly focus on \ncollective behavior. Behavioral finance literature and the business world frequently confuse the distinction \nbetween individual and collective behavior. We must very carefully avoid extrapolating individual irrationality \nto market irrationality. The second need not follow from the first.  \n \nThe behavioral finance attacks on the efficient market hypothesis largely seek to discredit the first and third \narguments for market efficiency: rational agents and the no-arbitrage assumption. Certainly the behavioral \nfinance work has corroborated what every aware human knows: individuals are not rational. The case \nagainst agent rationality is really a straw man, because no one literally believes the rational agent \nargument. Indeed, neoclassical finance has retrenched to the no-arbitrage theory. 42 \n \nMore recently, the behavioral finance arguments have targeted no arbitrage on the basis that arbitrage in \nthe real world has many imperfections. Transaction costs, risks, a lack of substitute securities, and noise \ntraders can all undermine the arbitrageur\u2019s activities. The behavioral finance school is careful about \nclaiming that the inefficiencies they see are systematically exploitable. They are reasonably content in the \nclaim that asset prices do not always reflect fundamental value. 43 \n \nThe behavioral camp doesn\u2019t have much to say about the second path to efficiency\u2014the uncorrelated \nerrors of investors. But where there are comments, they tend to be dismissive. Shleifer rebuffs the wisdom \nof crowds argument in one fell swoop: 44 \n \nIt is this argument that the Kahneman and Tversky theories dispose of entirely. The psychological \nevidence shows precisely that people do not deviate from rationality randomly, but rather most \ndeviate in the same way.  \n \nShleifer overstates his argument. While investors may deviate from rationality in the same way, it doesn\u2019t \nmean they won\u2019t err independently. Take, for example, overconfidence. Researchers have demonstrated \nquite conclusively that individuals are overconfident in their own capabilities. Yet if degrees of \noverconfidence are spread randomly across the buyers and sellers of a security, we have no reason to \nbelieve the effects won\u2019t offset one another. \n \nAn analysis of market efficiency on the collective level proves more fertile than studying individuals. The \ndynamics shift from how individuals behave to how individuals behave when they are with, or can observe \nthe behavior of, others.  \n \n"

      "text": " \nLegg Mason Capital Management \n11 \nWhile a full discussion of social psychology is beyond our scope, a few concepts can provide relevance in \nunderstanding how collectives might violate one or more of the conditions of the wisdom of crowds: \n \n\u2022 \nImitation. Most investors view imitation with some misgiving (belying their often-imitative actions). \nBut imitation can be rational if someone else has more information than you or if you are trying to \nminimize tracking error to preserve assets. We know humans innately desire to be part of a \ncrowd. Imitation is one of the prime mechanisms for positive feedback. 45   \n\u2022 \nNetwork theory. In recent years scientists made great strides in understanding how we interact \nwith one another. Social networks form the backbone across which ideas travel. Adoption \nthresholds\u2014our willingness to embrace a new idea\u2014and the small world effect are important \nconcepts here. 46 \n\u2022 \nInformation cascades. Cascades, which include booms, fads, and fashions, occur when people \nmake decisions based on the actions of others rather than on their own private information. \nCascades often result from a small initial stimulus. Such cascades occur relatively rarely, and the \npublic widely recognizes them only after the fact. 47  \n\u2022 \nNonlinearity.  Most ideas and technologies diffuse along an S-curve with a nonlinear rate of \nadoption. This is a more formal statement of the colloquial idea of the tipping point. Since humans \ntend to extrapolate recent results, this nonlinearity can lead to market mispricing. 48  \n \nThis discussion of group behavior points to where the violation of market efficiency conditions will most \nlikely occur. Studies show that humans (and other species) get caught up in positive feedback and become \nalmost purely imitative, causing a diversity breakdown. If valid, this idea of diversity breakdowns suggests \nthe risk of sharp price changes is endogenous to markets, versus the general assumption that risk is \nexogenous.  \n \nWe argue that diversity breakdowns are the exception not the norm (which is why almost all books on the \n\u201cmadness of crowds\u201d start with the Tulip Mania and South Sea Bubble, events that occurred centuries ago). \nOn the heels of one of the great manias of all-time, it\u2019s hard to deny that manias exist and it\u2019s even harder \nto fit them comfortably into an efficient market framework.  \n \nDiversity breakdowns often lead to significant asset price changes. The largest of these in recent memory is \nthe 1987 crash, a day when the S&P 500 plunged 20.6%. It\u2019s difficult to see how a 20%-plus change in \nprices in a single day is consistent with either the rational agent or the no-arbitrage theories. In his \ndiscussion of the 1987 crash, finance father Merton Miller allowed the work of Benoit Mandelbrot, a \npolymath best known for his development of fractal geometry and a staunch critic of standard theory. 49 \n \nTo summarize the argument to this point, the wisdom of crowds best explains how we achieve market \nefficiency. Not only does this approach have a substantial track record in nature and in solving other \nproblems, it achieves its results with relatively relaxed assumptions about agent rationality (not even a \nsmall percentage of agents need be rational). \n \nThe mechanism has the additional feature of being consistent with social psychology in showing how \nmarkets get inefficient when they violate one of the wisdom of crowds conditions. The most likely condition \nto be compromised is investor diversity, and the mechanisms to understand information cascades are \nimproving rapidly. \n \nConceptualizing markets as a complex adaptive system leads to some stylized predictions. These include: \n \n\u2022 \nMarkets are generally efficient. We expect few individuals to generate excess returns over time. \nThe facts certainly support this prediction. \n\u2022 \nWe should see active trading. Since investors have heterogeneous decision rules, active trading\u2014\nespecially surrounding important news developments\u2014is what you would expect.  \n\u2022 \nWe will see large price changes. This approach suggests that significant price movements are \ninherent in the system because of diversity breakdowns. Risk and reward are not linearly related. \nThis prediction fits the facts well. \n \nWe now turn away from how markets are efficient (or inefficient) and focus on what the market\u2019s statistical \nproperties look like. \n"

First, they suggest that price changes are statistically independent from one another . . . The \nsecond assumption is that price changes are distributed in a pattern that conforms to a standard bell curve. \n \nDo financial data neatly conform to such assumptions? Of course, they never do.  \n \nBenoit B. Mandelbrot \nA Multifractal Walk Down Wall Street 50 \n \nAn accurate market description is an important step in developing a new theory for how markets work. Of \ncourse, this notion is constant in the evolution of ideas. (Perhaps no better example exists than our \nunderstanding of the solar system.) As Benoit Mandelbrot has argued, \u201cFailure to explain is caused by \nfailure to describe.\u201d 51 \n \nMost academics describe markets using mean/variance efficiency, which paves the way for a host of robust \nstatistical tools. Most of these tools, including random walk models, assume a normal distribution of price \nchanges. When investment people throw around terms like standard deviation, alpha, beta, and volatility, \nthey\u2019re falling back on a world of normal distributions.   \n \nThe beauty of the normal distribution is that we can specify a distribution with just two variables, mean and \nstandard deviation. Most investors estimate ex ante asset class returns using these terms. Many \nprofessional investors and corporate executives use risk and standard deviation interchangeably.   \n \nOur discussion of market mechanisms, however, shows that markets periodically witness diversity \nbreakdowns, which lead to large price changes. Further, these price changes fall outside the normal \ndistribution. To state the obvious, these large changes can have a meaningful impact on results\u2014as Long \nTerm Capital Management and other investment firms have learned. Nobel-prize winning physicist Phil \nAnderson said it well: 52 \n \nMuch of the world is controlled as much by the \u201ctails\u201d of distributions as by means or averages: by \nthe exceptional, not the mean; by the catastrophe, not the steady drip; by the very rich, not the \n\u201cmiddle class.\u201d We need to free ourselves from \u201caverage\u201d thinking.  \n \nBenoit Mandelbrot was one of the earliest critics of using normal distributions to explain stock price \nchanges. Mandelbrot summarizes some of his important findings in the Noah Effect and the Joseph \nEffect.53  \n \nNamed after the biblical ark-building figure, the Noah Effect describes the market\u2019s trait of abrupt change or \ndiscontinuity\u2014fat tails. Power laws may represent these price series better than normal distributions. The \nkey practical implication is that standard models understate risk. \n \nThe Joseph Effect, which harkens to the Hebrew slave who prophesied seven years of feast and famine, \nrelates to the market\u2019s tendency to have a long-term memory\u2014for example, a rise in stocks tends to be \nfollowed by additional increases. Recent work by other financial economists supports this analysis. 54 \nMandelbrot developed new statistical tools to measure both the Noah and Joseph effects.       \n \nNotwithstanding the empirical evidence, Mandelbrot\u2019s work remains outside mainstream economics. Writes \nMirowski, \u201cthe simple historical fact is that [Mandelbrot\u2019s economic ideas] have been by and large ignored, \nwith some few exceptions . . . which seem to have been subsequently abandoned by their authors.\u201d 55 \n \nOne example of Mirowski\u2019s point is the evolution of Eugene Fama\u2019s work, widely considered the father of \nefficient markets. His early papers provide some of the most convincing empirical proof that normal \ndistributions do not apply. In his 1965 Journal of Business paper he writes: 56 \n \nIn previous research on the distribution of price changes the emphasis has been on the general \nshape of the distribution, and the conclusion has been that the distribution is approximately \n"

Recent finds of Benoit Mandelbrot, however, have raised serious doubts \nregarding the validity of the Gaussian hypothesis . . . The conclusion of this paper is that \nMandelbrot\u2019s hypothesis does seem supported by the data.  \n \nGoing forward, Fama seems much less interested in the issue of price change distributions and more \nfocused on whether or not anyone can beat the market. From his 1965 Financial Analysts Journal article, \n\u201cThe empirical evidence to date provides strong support for the random walk model.\u201d  57 \n \nFama\u2019s emphasis shifted away from the shape of the distribution towards the independence of price \nchanges, which is all the random walk asserts. By the 1960s we had clear and sufficient evidence to \ncontemplate the implications of non-normal distributions for real-world applications like risk management.  \n \nNone of this is to say that practitioners and academics don\u2019t understand how the real world works. \nPractitioners patch up models to capture observable empirical features. Rather than dismiss the standard \ntheory altogether, most academics are content to add patches to the existing theory. This approach has the \nadditional feature of rewarding the mathematically fluent.  \n \nExamples of theory patching include Black\u2019s \u201cnoise\u201d traders, generalized auto-regressive conditional \nheteroskedasticity (GARCH) models, jump diffusion models, and Fama and French\u2019s multifactor risk \nmodel.58 Each of these models departs from standard theory in an effort to provide more accurate \npredictions.  \n \nWhile the view of markets through the lens of complex systems is relatively new, three factors make us \noptimistic. First, a number of agent-based models have successfully replicated the features of the market. \nSome of these models show two regimes: efficient and inefficient\u2014complete with booms and crashes. \nWhile necessarily simple, these in silico models lend support to the view that the interaction of \nheterogeneous agents can generate realistic efficient and inefficient outcomes. 59   \n  \nSecond, scientists have found statistical techniques useful in other social science applications. One \nillustration is Robert Axtell\u2019s work on Zipf\u2019s Law and company size. Zipf\u2019s Law accurately explains the \nrelationship between company size and frequency in the United States. 60 \n \nFinally, some researchers claim that stock market crashes have a statistical signature: log periodicity. \nWhether this theory is valid remains to be seen. Importantly, it offers specific predictions about when there \nis an elevated probability of a crash. 61 \n \nConclusion \n \nThe efficient market hypothesis offers a practically sound prescription: most investors are best served \ninvesting in low cost, passive index funds. Overwhelming evidence, accumulated over many decades, \nshows a consistent inability of most active investment managers to add value. \n \nActive investment managers seeking excess returns should have a thoughtful investment process that \nlogically starts with a view on how and why market mispricings can occur. Of the three approaches to \nexplain market efficiency, only the complex adaptive systems perspective comfortably accommodates what \nwe see in the real world: heterogeneous investors create markets, which remain mostly efficient but \nperiodically go to excesses. The rational agent and no-arbitrage approaches, while valuable constructs, are \nnot true mechanisms and fail to explain real market behavior in many important respects. \n \nThe ultimate goal of an active investor is to buy securities in anticipation of an expectations revision. In a \nfuture piece, we will address the logical question: how can we use these ideas to generate excess returns \nin the stock market?    \n"
