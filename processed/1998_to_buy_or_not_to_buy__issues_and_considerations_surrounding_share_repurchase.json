On\nthe one hand, strong corporate surplus cash flows, favorable tax laws, and an\nincreasing focus on shareholder value encourage managers to embrace buybacks.\nOn the other hand, high price/earnings multiples, the surge of employee stock\noption programs, and the desire for internal growth make the virtues of repur-\nchases less clear.\nThe vote of the marketplace, however, is unambiguous. In 1997, American com-\npanies announced $182 billion worth of stock repurchase programs, nearly dou-\nble the amount pledged in 1995 (see Chart 1). Dividends, on the other hand, grew\nonly 5% during the same time.1 Buybacks are also becoming more prominent in\nEurope and Asia,2 reflecting easing regulations and a heightened focus on value\ncreation. For example, share repurchase programs in Europe are expected to\nreach $30 billion in 1998, up from $14 billion in 1997. 3\n&KDUW\u0003\u0014\n6KDUH\u00035HSXUFKDVH\u0003$QQRXQFHPHQWV\u000f\u0003\u0014\u001c\u001b\u0013\u00b2\u0014\u001c\u001c\u001b\u0003WR\u0003'DWH\n0.3\n0.6\n0.7\n6.8\n27.3\n20.3\n28.2\n55.0\n37.4\n63.7\n36.1\n20.4\n35.6\n38.3\n73.8\n99.5\n176.3 181.8\n82.6\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998\nYTD\nAnnounced share repurchases ($ billion)\n6RXUFH\u001d\u00036HFXULWLHV\u0003'DWD\u0003&RPSDQ\\\u0011\nWhile measuring and valuing dividends is relatively straightforward, buybacks\u2014\nwith a wide array of methods and goals\u2014are more difficult to read.

      "text": "Frontiers of Finance\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nBefore exploring philosophies on buybacks, it is important to examine when the\nissue is relevant. We find there are five main catalysts for a company to buy\nback stock. The first is the desire to return excess cash to shareholders. Second,\nmanagement may sell or spin off a division and use a buyback to redirect the\nproceeds to shareholders. Third is a desire to alter a company\u2019s capital structure.\nFourth, buybacks serve to offset dilution from employee stock option programs.\nIn this case, buybacks essentially represent another form of employee compensa-\ntion. Finally, management may view its shares as a good investment. These\npoints are further developed below:\n\u2022 Redeployment of excess cash. A company generates surplus cash when its\nearnings exceed its investment opportunities. A quick litmus test for this condi-\ntion is any company that has a return on invested capital (ROIC) in excess of its\nearnings growth rate. As ROIC represents the maximum earnings growth rate a\nbusiness can achieve excluding external financing, growth below ROIC leads to\nexcess cash flow.\n\u2022 Redirecting proceeds from an asset sale or spinoff. In many spinoffs, a cash\ndividend is paid to the parent company. Corporations often hesitate to sell busi-\nnesses, even value destroyers, because the net impact\u2014the benefit of cash rede-\nployment versus the loss of operating profits\u2014results in earnings per share\ndilution. Share buybacks can play an important role in returning nonproductive\ninvested capital to shareholders.\n\u2022 Increasing the target debt/equity ratio. An increase in financial leverage,\nwhich can be effected through a debt-financed share buyback program, often\nserves to lower a company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. This is because\nrelatively low-cost debt replaces high-cost equity in the capital structure. As fu-\nture cash flows are discounted at the cost of capital, a lower cost of capital\ntranslates into a higher present value\u2014enhancing shareholder value.\n\u2022 Neutralizing dilution from stock options. Managers generally prefer to avoid\nan upward creep in the share count as a result of stock options, especially as such\na trend is readily evident on the income statement. Share buybacks offset this\nembarrassment of riches, and can only be detected through the cash flow and\nbalance sheet statements to boot.\n\u2022 The shares become a compelling investment opportunity. Periodically, manag-\ners may find that their company\u2019s stock is undervalued. If management\u2018s assess-\nment is valid, a share repurchase program offers the potential for excess returns\nfor ongoing shareholders.\n We find there are two fundamental schools of thought regarding share repurchase\nas a financial policy. We explore each of them below.\nThe \u201cEfficient Market\u201d School\n This view is based on the idea that the stock market is efficient over time. As a\nresult, buybacks can be effected consistently over time with the assurance that\nthe company will get a \u201cfair\u201d price, on average. Adherents of this perspective\nstress the importance of returning cash to shareholders in a cost-effective and\ntax-efficient manner. Key underpinnings of this school include the following:\n\u2022 The current tax rate differential suggests that buybacks are significantly more\nefficient than dividends for taxpaying individuals. Specifically, dividends are\ntaxed at an individual\u2019s tax rate\u2014now as high as 39.6%. In contrast, the long-\n:KHQ\u0003,V\u00036KDUH\n5HSXUFKDVH\n5HOHYDQW\"\n 7ZR\u00033KLORVRSKLHV\u0003RQ\n6KDUH\u0003%X\\EDFNV\n"

      "text": "Frontiers of Finance\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nterm capital gains tax rate is 20%, roughly half the highest individual rate. Even\nthis huge tax rate differential understates the benefit of buybacks. Specifically,\nshareholders who want a cash yield similar to a dividend can sell a portion of\ntheir holdings, but only need to pay capital gains taxes on the difference between\ntheir cost and the selling price. In contrast, a dividend is fully taxable. For com-\npanies seeking to return cash to stockholders with minimum government interfer-\nence, share buybacks are the best way to go.\n\u2022 Share buybacks are more tax efficient than dividends in another important\nway. Ongoing shareholders can hold onto their stock and defer their tax pay-\nments until they sell (in theory, an indefinite period). Meanwhile, buybacks serve\nto increase their proportionate ownership of the business. Hence, share repur-\nchases are advantageous as a result of the both the rate and the timing of taxes.\n\u2022 Repurchases offer corporations greater flexibility than dividends. Share buy-\nbacks can be accelerated or decelerated as a company\u2019s cash flows changes.\nDividends are more like a quasi-contract. Once a dividend is initiated, investors\ngenerally expect ongoing payments and periodic increases.\n\u2022 Buybacks are cheaper for companies to execute. Dividends must be distributed\nto all shareholders and entail significant administrative time and expense. In\ncontrast, open market purchases can be executed at a lower cost\u2014often cents per\nshare.\n One well-known practitioner in the \u201cefficient market\u201d camp is Coca-Cola. In\nrecent years KO has increasingly relied on share buybacks to return excess cash\nto shareholders. The company\u2019s dividend payout ratio\u2014dividends divided by net\nincome\u2014declined from 44% in 1992 to roughly 35% in 1997. Notably, the pace\nof buybacks for Coca-Cola is dictated more by its available cash flow than by the\nstock\u2019s prevailing price/earnings multiple.\nThe \u201cIntrinsic Value\u201d School\n Advocates of this perspective argue that companies should only repurchase\nshares when the stock trades below \u201cintrinsic value.\u201d Intrinsic value is defined as\nthe cumulative present value of a company\u2019s future cash flows. This view im-\nplicitly assumes that managers have \u201casymmetric information,\u201d that is, they have\nbetter knowledge of a company\u2019s future than do investors. It follows that share\nbuybacks can be preferable to reinvesting in the business, including prospective\nacquisitions, if implicit returns with the repurchase are higher. Key considera-\ntions for this camp include:\n\u2022 The \u201cshareholder rate of return\u201d from buybacks is estimated by dividing the\ncost of equity by the ratio of stock price to intrinsic value.4 For example, a com-\npany with a cost of equity of 10% and a stock that is 80% of intrinsic value\nwould have an implied rate of return of 12.5%. This return can then be compared\nto other projects and ranked in relative attractiveness.\n\u2022 The increase in intrinsic value per share that results from buying an underval-\nued stock can be estimated using a simple formula (see Appendix A). Key deter-\nminants of the value improvement are the discount to intrinsic value and the\npercentage of shares retired.\n\u2022 This view supports the notion that buybacks are a powerful signal to the mar-\nket. Academics have long maintained that one of the key virtues of a repurchase\nprogram is the positive message it sends about the attractiveness of the stock.\n"

Man-\nagement should have an up-to-date view on a stock\u2019s appropriate value, given\nassumptions of key value drivers. In turn, discrepancies between market value\nand intrinsic value can be exploited to the benefit of ongoing shareholders.\n\u2022 It must be noted that senior managers are consistently overoptimistic in\nappraising their company\u2019s prospects. History is littered with companies that re-\npurchased \u201cundervalued\u201d shares only to see business prospects sour and the\nstocks go down. Hence, an announced buyback program\u2014even an aggressive\none\u2014is not an automatic signal of value.\n Ralston Purina serves as a good example of the intrinsic value school of thought.5\nFrom the early 1980s through the mid 1990s, Ralston\u2019s CEO, William Stiritz,\nastutely directed the repurchase of over 50% of the company\u2019s outstanding\nshares. The company was aggressive in periods of modest investor expectations\nand inactive when the stock reflected sanguine prospects. Importantly, the stock\ndelivered attractive total shareholder returns during Stiritz\u2019s tenure.\n The famed investor Warren Buffett also adheres to this view. In his 1984 letter to\nBerkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett wrote:\n \u201cWhen companies with outstanding businesses and comfortable financial posi-\ntions find their shares selling far below intrinsic value in the marketplace, no al-\nternative can benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases.\u201d\n Before we move on, we must address two fundamental misperceptions regarding\nbuybacks. The first is that repurchasing shares at a high multiple of earnings per\nshare implies \u201coverpaying\u201d for the stock and hence is undesirable. For example,\nthe \u201creturn\u201d on a buyback of a stock with a P/E of 25 is deemed to be the inverse\nof the P/E\u2014a poor 4%.\n The second is that buybacks that boost reported earnings per share are necessar-\nily good\u2014and repurchases that dilute reported earnings are necessarily bad. As\nan illustration, companies are often reticent to sell value-destroying businesses\nand allocate the proceeds to repurchases because of the negative impact on earn-\nings.\n Both misperceptions hinge on the flawed logic that price/earnings multiples or\nchanges in earnings per share mirror economic reality. The weakness in this line\nof thinking can be proven formally (see Appendix B) or through armchair rea-\nsoning. We build on the latter here. The value of any financial asset\u2014including a\nstock\u2014is the present value of a future stream of cash flows. Just as discounting\nfuture cash flows at an \u201cexpected return\u201d translates everything into present value\nterms, shareholders look for their stock to increase in value at the same \u201cexpected\nreturn\u201d over time. Accordingly, the implied \u201creturn\u201d from a share buyback in an\nefficient market is the cost of equity.\n The cost of equity capital cannot be reliably linked to P/E or cash flow multiples\nbecause those multiples reflect variables other than the discount rate. These in-\nclude growth, capital intensity, and the sustainability of a company\u2019s franchise.\nThe cost of equity for most companies in the United States is estimated to be in\nthe 9-12% range\u2014consistent with the long-term return of stocks.\n 6KDUH\u0003%X\\EDFN\n0LVSHUFHSWLRQV\n"

      "text": "Frontiers of Finance\n\u2013 6 \u2013\n Similar thinking can be applied to the issue of earnings accretion/dilution from\nbuybacks. The point is best illustrated with a simple example. Assume an other-\nwise successful company has a business unit that delivers a subpar 5% return on\ncapital versus the company\u2019s 10% cost of capital. Assume further that the com-\npany\u2019s stock commands a P/E of 40 times.\n Sale of the low-return unit at book value, with the proceeds used to repurchase\nshares, results in earnings per share dilution\u2014a 5% return business is traded for a\n2.5% \u201creturn\u201d with a buyback. However, it enhances shareholder value. This is\nbecause the true return on the buyback is the 10% cost of equity, not the 2.5%\nimplied by the inverse of the P/E. Swapping a 5% return project for a 10% return\nproject may not seem like a difficult decision (see Appendix C). However, man-\nagers frequently balk at such trade-offs because of the negative earnings per\nshare impact.\n This section deals with the role of share repurchase in overall corporate finance.\nHere we consider a number of issues, including various methods of repurchase,\nkey determinants of market signals, capital structure changes, and the use of\nderivative products in buybacks. While these issues may only appear relevant for\ncompanies, we believe that investors should understand the impact\u2014as well as\nthe thought process\u2014underlying these decisions.\nMethods\n There are four main methods of repurchasing shares. Each has strengths and\nweaknesses relative to specific corporate finance objectives. A brief review of\neach technique follows:\n\u2022 Open market purchases. This is the most widely used technique by far. Com-\npanies simply repurchase their own shares in the open market, similar to any\nother investor. While there are legal restrictions on open market purchases\u2014for\nexample, a company is limited in the daily volume it can represent\u2014this method\noffers the greatest degree of flexibility. On the other hand, open market pur-\nchases generally provide the weakest signal of management conviction. Dilution\nfrom employee stock option programs is generally offset through open market\npurchases.\n\u2022 Dutch auction. In a Dutch auction, management defines the number of shares\nit intends to buy, an expiration date, and a price range\u2014generally a premium to\nthe market\u2014that it is willing to pay. Shareholders may tender stock at any price\nin the range. Starting at the bottom of the range, the company then adds up the\ncumulative number of shares necessary to fulfill the program. All tendering\nshareholders at or below the \u201cclearing price\u201d receive the clearing price for their\nstock. Dutch auctions are generally good signals6 and are relatively efficient to\nexecute. Because of the range in prices offered, a Dutch auction has less risk of\nundersubcription than a fixed price offer.\n\u2022 Fixed price tender offer. Here, management offers to repurchase a set number\nof shares at a fixed price through an expiration date. The price is often a signifi-\ncant premium to the market price, and companies generally tender for a substan-\ntial percentage of shares outstanding. Like a tender offer in an acquisition,\nshareholders may or may not elect to tender their shares. Fixed price tenders\u2014\nespecially those funded with debt\u2014are generally powerful, positive signals to the\nmarket. However, the drawback is that management may not achieve its goals if\ntoo few shares are tendered.\n &RUSRUDWH\u0003)LQDQFH\n,VVXHV\n"

In the 1980s, a number of companies engaged in \u201cgreen-\nmail,\u201d private repurchase transactions that served to fend off unwanted overtures.\nThe practice of greenmail is markedly less friendly to shareholder value than\nother types of buybacks. By paying raiders a premium for their large stakes,\nmanagers effectively transfer wealth from ongoing shareholders. Accordingly,\nprivate transactions have become much less common in the 1990s.\nSignals\n Finance professors argue that stocks generally react favorably to share repur-\nchases largely because of the positive signals they send to the market.7 The char-\nacteristics of each buyback program can generate varying signal intensities. The\nresearch suggests that there are four key drivers of the stock market signal.\n The first is the percentage of float that is retired. All things equal, a larger pro-\ngram indicates greater management conviction. The second is the premium the\ncompany is willing to pay versus the last trade\u2014the bigger the better. Sizable\npremiums suggest not only a belief that business prospects are more bullish than\nthe market reflects but also a willingness to act on such conviction.\n Third is the percentage ownership by insiders. High inside ownership means that\nthe interests of managers and shareholders are aligned; but it also suggests that\nrisk-averse managers would pursue financial restructuring only if they were con-\nfident of a favorable outcome. The final issue is insider selling. When manage-\nment effects a sizable repurchase program and indicates it will not sell any\nshares, it is increasing its bet on the success of the firm. This sends a favorable\nmessage to the market.\nCapital Structure\n Share repurchase can play a central role in changing a company\u2019s capital struc-\nture. Specifically, buybacks are an efficient way to increase the debt/equity ratio\nfor underleveraged firms. An appropriate level of financial leverage results in an\n\u201coptimal capital structure\u201d\u2014a healthy balance between beneficial tax shields and\nthe risk of financial distress (see Chart 2). This minimizes the cost of capital,\nwhich enhances shareholder value.\n"

For a company with positive pretax\nprofits, tax-deductible interest expense creates a valuable tax shield. We can es-\ntimate the value of this shield using one of two ways. The first approach, which\nassumes a permanent change in capital structure, is to capitalize the tax savings.\nThis is calculated by dividing the tax savings (interest expense times the mar-\nginal tax rate) by the pretax cost of debt. The second approach is the adjusted\npresent value (APV) method.10 APV determines the value of business by sum-\nming its unlevered value and the value of its financial strategy. APV offers more\nflexibility than capitalizing tax shields because it accommodates changing capital\nstructures.\n\u2022 Varying tax rates complicate the debt versus equity decision. As seen above,\nchanges in corporate, personal, and capital gains tax rates can amplify or dampen\nthe advantage of debt versus equity financing.11 The current tax code slightly fa-\nvors the prudent use of debt.\n\u2022 At a certain point, the risks of financial distress outweigh the benefit of debt.\nToo much debt can lead to an inability to meet contractually obligated commit-\nments, even for a business with healthy cash flows. Financial distress is onerous,\nwith substantial direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include legal and adminis-\ntrative fees in bankruptcy. Indirect costs include forgone business with suppliers\nand customers that are uncertain about the future of a financially distressed firm.\nManagers should weigh the benefit of financial leverage against the potential\ncost.\n\u2022 What about \u201cfinancial flexibility?\u201d Managers often argue that a conservative\ncapital structure is important in order to maintain financial flexibility. Financial\nflexibility can be defined as the ability to quickly access capital for an attractive\ninvestment opportunity or to weather a business downturn. The value of this op-\ntion is questionable for a couple of reasons. First, the capital required to fund\nvalue-creating projects, be it debt or equity, can be generally raised rapidly and\ncheaply. Second, managers often do not take into account the opportunity cost of\nexcess capital parked on the balance sheet. If shareholders can redeploy funds at\na rate higher than what the cash earns, the capital should be returned to share-\nholders.\nDerivative Products\nWhile thousands of companies have repurchased shares in recent years, a rela-\ntively small percentage have used derivative products to execute their programs.\nSuch products can offer valuable benefits to companies seeking to actively buy\nback stock.\nThe most widely used derivative technique is the sale of put warrants.12 A put\nwarrant is the right to sell a security at a given price and time. In this case, the\ncompany determines a strike price and life of the warrant, and collects a premium\nfrom the buyer. Interestingly, the premium collected is tax-free. Also, companies\nonly need to report their programs if they are deemed to be \u201cmaterial.\u201d\nThe potential consequences of put warrant sales are straightforward. If the stock\nis flat or rises, the premium gathered lowers the net cost of the repurchase pro-\ngram. It is only if the stock goes down more than the difference between the\nstrike price and the premium that the company loses.\n"

This increases down-\nside risk but offers more attractive purchase levels in the event the stock rises\nsignificantly.\nFinally, \u201caccelerated share repurchase\u201d programs (ASRs), are gaining in popu-\nlarity. In an ASR, a company purchases shares from an investment bank (which\ngoes short the stock), allowing it to retire a large block of shares immediately.\nSimultaneously, the company enters into a forward contract with the investment\nbank in which it agrees to pay the bank the average market price of the shares\nrepurchased over a specified period\u2014typically six months.\nAt the end of the period, there is a net settlement (in cash or stock) between the\nparties. The company pays the investment bank\u2014or gets credited\u2014the differ-\nence between the initial and average share buyback price. The bank pays the\ncompany the time value of the funds, less dividends.\nBoth parties win. The investment bank earns a fee for its participation. The com-\npany immediately reduces its shares outstanding and receives a tax-efficient re-\nturn on the cash held by the investment bank. In contrast, an open market\nprogram reduces the share count slowly, and the interest income earned on the\noriginal purchase price is taxable.\nOne of the major catalysts for the surge in announced share repurchase programs\nis the desire to mitigate earnings per share dilution from employee stock option\n(ESO) programs. Buybacks in this context are best viewed as \u201coff-income-\nstatement\u201d employee compensation, rather than a mechanism to return cash to\nshareholders or a tool to manage the capital structure.\nWhile the debate about the virtues and drawbacks of ESOs rages on,13 three\npoints are clear.14 First, the growth in ESOs is a symptom of more profound\nchanges occurring within the economy. Second, it is important to understand the\neconomics of ESOs\u2014especially given that the bulk of the information about\nthem is not found in standard financial statements. Finally, managers with hefty\nESO packages have a real economic incentive to repurchase shares instead of\npaying dividends.\nThe global economy is evolving. Physical capital\u2014bricks and mortar\u2014is being\nreplaced by intellectual, structural, and human capital\u2014harnessed brainpower.\nPeople have become the new foundation for competitive advantage. And people\nwant something that bricks and mortar never asked for: a piece of the action.\nThat means equity ownership. For investors, this is good news and bad news.\nThe good news is that earnings from \u201cnew economy\u201d companies are worth more\nthan the earnings of \u201cold economy\u201d companies. This point is best supported by\nthe derivation of \u201cfree cash flow\u201d using standard finance terms (see Table 3).\n7KH\u0003(YROYLQJ\n(FRQRP\\\u0003DQG\u0003(62V\n"

Free cash flow is the differ-\nence between earnings and required investments\u2014working and fixed capital. As\nmost of these investments are capitalized, they do not show up on the income\nstatement. Since a substantial amount of capital is required to maintain and grow\nold economy businesses, free cash flow is typically substantially less than re-\nported earnings.\nEarnings for new economy businesses are calculated in the same way as their old\neconomy brethren. However, there is one distinction: only partial employee com-\npensation is reflected on the expense line. Free cash flow, too, nets investments\nagainst earnings. But here is the significant difference between the old and the\nnew. In new economy businesses, investments\u2014such as R&D and marketing\u2014\nare largely expensed. As a result, free cash flow and earnings are similar.\nBoth old and new economy businesses have investment needs; they are just\nrecorded differently by the accountants. Because new-economy businesses\ngenerate more cash for a given level of earnings, they deserve higher earnings\nmultiples, all things being equal.\nNow, here is the bad news. All things are not equal. For new economy compa-\nnies, there is a substantial employee compensation claim in the form of ESOs\nthat is not captured in traditional financial statements. Investors must try to value\nthis claim, and consider it in the investment decision process.\nHow do you value the claim? There are two basic approaches. The first is to use\nan option-pricing model, like Black-Scholes, to value the outstanding options.\nBlack-Scholes is driven by a few key variables including interest rates, life of the\noptions, strike prices, and volatility of the stock. Assumptions for these data are\nfound in the footnotes of a company\u2019s annual report. The value of the options\nshould be subtracted from corporate value\u2014like debt or other liabilities\u2014to de-\ntermine shareholder value.\nAn alternative approach is to make an upward adjustment in the cost of equity\nestimate to reflect a steady rate of dilution. This simplified model only works if\nthe percentage of dilution is constant year to year, a constrictive assumption. The\nformula is as follows:\nAdjusted Ke = [Base Ke + (1.1(% dilution))]\n"

Under\ncertain restrictive conditions, this approach generates the same per-share value as\nthe options pricing model. However, we prefer the option pricing method as it\noffers substantially more transparency and flexibility.\nThis shift toward paying new economy executives with stock options also gives\ncompanies a real economic incentive to return excess cash via a share repurchase\ninstead of paying a dividend. This is because the owner of a stock option benefits\nonly when the price of the underlying stock goes up. However, after an investor\nreceives cash-in-hand from a dividend payment, the stock\u2019s price will fall by pre-\ncisely that amount.\nThus, while dividends may be an important part of total shareholder returns, they\nalways lower a stock\u2019s absolute price level. Accordingly, the value of an option\nto buy that stock will also fall. Conversely, a share buyback returning the same\namount of cash to shareholders does not lower the market value of ongoing\nshares. This difference gives option-laden managers an economically compelling\nreason to return cash to stockholders via share buybacks instead of dividends.\nIndeed, as new economy companies increasingly rely on stock options to com-\npensate executives, we expect the shift toward share repurchase to accelerate.15\n1\u0011%\u0011\u001d\u0003&5(',7\u000368,66(\u0003),567\u0003%26721\u0003&25325$7,21\u0003PD\\\u0003KDYH\u000f\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003ODVW\u0003WKUHH\u0003\\HDUV\u000f\u0003VHUYHG\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003PDQDJHU\u0003RU\nFR\u0010PDQDJHU\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003SXEOLF\u0003RIIHULQJ\u0003RI\u0003VHFXULWLHV\u0003IRU\u0003RU\u0003PDNHV\u0003D\u0003SULPDU\\\u0003PDUNHW\u0003LQ\u0003LVVXHV\u0003RI\u0003DQ\\\u0003RU\u0003DOO\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FRPSDQLHV\u0003PHQ\u0010\nWLRQHG\u0011\u0003&ORVLQJ\u0003SULFHV\u0003DUH\u0003DV\u0003RI\u0003$XJXVW\u0003\u0017\u000f\u0003\u0014\u001c\u001c\u001b\u001d\n&RFD\u0010&ROD\u0003\u000b.2\u000f\u0003\u001a\u001b\u0018\u0012\u001b\u000f\u0003%X\\\f\r\n0LFURVRIW\u0003\u000b06)7\u000f\u0003\u0014\u0013\u0017\u0014\u0012\u0015\u000f\u00036WURQJ\u0003%X\\\f\r\n5DOVWRQ\u00033XULQD\u0003\u000b5$/\u000f\u0003\u0015\u001c\u0018\u0012\u001b\u000f\u00031RW\u00035DWHG\f\n\r)ROORZHG\u0003E\\\u0003D\u0003GLIIHUHQW\u0003&UHGLW\u00036XLVVH\u0003)LUVW\u0003%RVWRQ\u0003DQDO\\VW\u0011\n"

However, the firm now\nhas 20 less shares.

The more risk, the higher the return demanded. This ex-\nplains why investors in risk-free government bonds accept meager returns of less\nthan 6%, but venture capital firms demand lofty 20% to 30% returns before they\nwill provide capital to risky high-tech startups.\nStocks lie somewhere in the middle of this range. Equity investors in public\ncompanies generally require a return in the neighborhood of 9 to 12%. This\nnumber is not set in stone because each company faces a different risk profile\u2014\nfrom the stable cash flows of a utility to the volatile cash flows of an Internet\nstartup. In addition, debt can make equity more expensive, as it is a prior claim\non cash flows.\nHowever, whatever the demanded cost of equity, investors will price a stock so\nthat they will at least earn that return. Indeed, in an efficient market, investors\nwill bid stocks up and down until it is becomes impossible\u2014or at least very dif-\nficult\u2014for an equity investor to earn more than that cost of equity from divi-\ndends and capital gains. This is true whether we are talking about investors\npurchasing stock for their personal accounts, or companies repurchasing their\nshares in the open market.\nA simple example can make this clearer. Say two entities make separate promises\nto pay an investor $1,000 next year. The first entity, the U.S. Treasury, is backed\nby the full faith and credit of the U.S. government while the other, a risky high-\ntech startup company, is backed only by the start-up\u2019s somewhat flimsy earnings\npower.

Conversely,\nhigher risk translates into a higher discount rate, which means a lower stock\nprice.\nWe can also demonstrate this with a more complex, realistic example as well.

Indeed, many managers like share repurchase\nfor precisely that reason. By lowering the number of shares outstanding, buy-\nbacks have become a popular way to augment earnings per share.\nHowever, the accounting consequences of share buybacks are not always posi-\ntive. For instance, most accounting-focused managers avoid selling a value-\ndestroying division\u2014even at a price above intrinsic value\u2014if it lowers reported\nearnings per share. This is particularly true for companies that have executive\ncompensation programs tied to EPS targets.\nHowever, faithful readers of the Frontiers of Finance series will not be surprised\nwhen we claim that managers should focus instead on the economic conse-\nquences of such a decision. We corroborate this assertion by elaborating on the\nexample we laid out in the body of this report (see page 6).\nIn this example, a company is comprised of two divisions. The first, the Cash\nCow division, earns a return on invested capital of 40%. Using a cost of capital\nof 10%, a growth rate of 8%, and an assumption of zero net investment, we can\nuse the standard perpetuity present value formula to value the business. This\nformula\u2014cash earnings divided by cost of capital less growth\u2014yields a value of\n$1,000. The second business, the Dog division, earns a meager 5% return. Hold-\ning constant all assumptions except that for growth, we can calculate that the\nDog division\u2019s market value is $50.\nAccordingly, the combined divisions have a combined market capitalization of\n$1,050. With 100 shares outstanding, this translates to a price of $10.50 per share\n(see Table 8).\n$SSHQGL[\u0003&\n"

This amount is double the intrinsic value to\nour company of $50. As management has no investment needs, they would return\nthis money to shareholders via share repurchase. Should management accept this\noffer?\nThe accounting and economic analyses will give different answers. An economic\nanalysis indicates that the company is now worth $50 more, as it now has $100 in\ncash versus owning a business worth $50. Thus, firm value jumps from $1,050 to\n$1,100. Accordingly, before the company repurchases its shares, the share price\nwould jump to $11 to reflect this improvement. After the company returns the\n$100 in cash to shareholders by repurchasing 9.1 shares, the company\u2019s value\nwill fall back to $1,000. However, as there will now be only 90.9 shares out-\nstanding, the per-share value of our company would remain at $11, a 4.8% in-\ncrease from $10.50.
