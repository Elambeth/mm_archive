Exhibit 1 shows that about 70 percent of equity mutual funds had a single manager \nand 30 percent were run by teams 25 years ago. Today, those figures are reversed.2 Mutual funds managed \nby a team have become the norm. This prompts the question as to whether funds managed by teams deliver \nbetter results than those run by a single manager. \n \nExhibit 1: Mutual Fund Management: From Individuals to Teams \n \nSource: Saurin Patel and Sergei Sarkissian, \u201cTo Group or Not to Group? Evidence from Mutual Fund Databases,\u201d Journal of Financial and Quantitative \nAnalysis, Forthcoming, 2017 and Diamond Wang, \u201cWhat Does It Mean to Be in a Team? Evidence from U.S. Mutual Fund Managers,\u201d Working Paper, \nJune 17, 2016. \n \nSome studies have shown that funds run by teams have returns that are comparable or slightly lower than \nthose of funds run by individuals.3 Team-run funds were also found to be less risky in general.4 Separating \nfunds run by teams from those run by individuals is difficult to do accurately because of the way that \nperformance monitoring groups such as The Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) report the data. \nAs a consequence, the CRSP figures understate the results for funds run by teams.  \n \nRecent research by Saurin Patel and Sergei Sarkissian, professors of finance, corrects this issue. Upon re-\nexamining the data, they found that teams do outperform individual managers. They further examined the \nreturns of funds run by teams of various sizes relative to those of single-managed funds.5 Exhibit 2 shows that \nthe highest gains, adjusted for risk, come from teams of three members. There is a substantial drop to two-\nperson teams followed by teams of four. \n \n \n \n \n \n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nPercentage of Mutual Funds\nTeam-Managed\nSingle-Managed\n"

Evidence from Mutual Fund Databases,\u201d Journal of Financial and Quantitative \nAnalysis, Forthcoming, 2017. \n \nThe analysis by Patel and Sarkissian also shows that only the teams in large metropolitan areas, such as New \nYork or Boston, outperformed the single managers.6 This is because larger cities have more employees with \nhigher skill and productivity than smaller ones do, which creates favorable conditions for team results. There is \nnothing magical about a team. A team needs the requisite characteristics to succeed. \n \nJ. Richard Hackman was a professor of psychology at Harvard University who studied team performance. He \nemphasized that a team needs certain features to be legitimate. These include a stated task, clear boundaries, \nauthority to manage work processes, and an element of membership stability.6 Investment teams generally \nhave all of these features.        \n \nWe commonly use the term team loosely, but a true team exists only when there is interaction among its \nmembers. There may be many individuals within a company who have similar responsibilities and report to the \nsame manager. But workers are a co-acting group, not a team, if they do not interact to achieve their goals.  \n \nDefining the nature of the task is the first step in determining how best to meet a goal. A task has a specific \noutcome that an observer can measure and the team must be accountable for that outcome.7 Lots of tasks \nare better done by individuals than by teams, including writing and executive leadership.8 Teams are often \nbetter than individuals when the task demands the aggregation of heterogeneous input to solve a problem. \nHowever, teams should always have a stated purpose and process.  \n \nProperly constructed teams have defined boundaries, which means it is clear who is on the team and who is \nnot. Most professionals interact with lots of people inside and outside of their organizations, so they do not \nalways know which teams they belong to. Teams operate in the context of larger organizations and must \nmaintain and manage relations in that social system. You want your team to be defined clearly but also to be \npart of the broader organization. \n \nThat a team has clear authority is also critical. This means that team members understand which decisions are \ntheirs to make. Generally speaking, management is most effective at setting a task and building a team, and \nteam members are better suited at figuring out the work process and executing on the ground. Meeting the \ndefinition of a team is relatively straightforward in active investment management as the goal is to select \nsecurities and construct a portfolio that generates excess returns.   \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFour\nTwo\nThree\nRisk-Adjusted Gains Relative to \nSingle-Managed Mutual Funds (Basis Points)\nNumber of Managers\n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 11, 2017 \nAssembling a Dream Team \n4 \nFinally, the research shows that stable teams tend to perform better than teams that have members who \nrotate constantly. For example, analysis by the National Transportation Safety Board found that 73 percent of \naircraft \u201cincidents\u201d occur on a crew\u2019s first day of flying together.9 Stability is valuable because team members \nlearn about one another\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, figure out how to work together, and appreciate their \nshared goals.   \n \nWe discuss how to build an effective team in the investment industry. We then turn our attention to the \nspecific issue of women in the business. Women are underrepresented in fund management relative to other \ncognitively demanding jobs such as being a doctor or lawyer. We explore some potential explanations for this \nand provide some ideas about how to attract more women to the field in the appendix. \n \nBuilding an Effective Team \n \nTeams are common in the investment industry and appear to confer some performance advantage. But to \nimprove your odds of success you must be mindful about how you create and manage a team. To make a \nquality decision, an effective team must identify and vet alternatives and select the one that makes the most \nsense. This requires having a team of the proper size and composition that you manage effectively. Many \norganizations, including investment firms, can improve how they work in teams.      \n \nThe size of a team can have a big impact on its effectiveness. While the size will vary based on the nature of \nthe task, studies indicate there is an optimal range. Hackman studied this in detail and found that there is a \ntrade-off between size and productivity.10 Large teams promise greater potential productivity because the \nmore members there are, the greater the variety of skill and information. However, the size advantage is offset \nby a loss of productivity, which is the result of a decrease in individual motivation, coordination difficulties, and \nlack of communication. So you should add team members until the cost of the incremental member outstrips \nthe benefit. Hackman found that four to six is the ideal size for most teams. Further, smaller is better than \nlarger. You would rather have a team of three than one of seven or more.   \n \nPatel and Sarkissian\u2019s results are consistent with the conclusions from Hackman\u2019s research. Investment \nmanagement is a task of problem solving, and the professors show that teams tend to outperform individuals \nfor that type of task. Teams of three appear to be most effective. The numbers for teams of five or more are \nsimilar to those of three, but the researchers found they could draw no sound conclusions because the sample \nsize was too small. What is noteworthy is that the best results appear to come from teams that have an odd \nnumber. This allows for a tie-breaker if there is no clear consensus.   \n \nTeam composition is the second aspect of constructing an effective team. Diversity is the most important \nconcept in team construction. There are a number of aspects of diversity that are crucial to understand and \nconsider. These include what type of diversity is most conducive to quality decisions and why diversity can lead \nto bad results. Many leaders do not understand diversity well and fail to manage it effectively even when it \nexists. \n \nIt is common to understand and report on diversity based on social categories. These categories include \ngender, age, ethnicity, and religion. Another way to consider diversity is based on cognitive capabilities (see \nexhibit 3). Examples include training, education, personality, and functional knowledge.    \n \nA team solving problems should strive for high cognitive diversity. This equips the team with a wide range of \ntools and information that it uses to make effective decisions and solve thorny problems. Think of each task as \nrequiring a specific type of tool. A cognitively diverse team has lots of tools in the toolbox, allowing it to match \nthe proper tool to the task.  \n"

Neale, \u201cWhat Differences Make a Difference? The Promise and Reality of Diverse Teams in Organizations,\u201d \nPsychological Science in the Public Interest, Vol. 6, No. 2, October 2005, 36. \n \nScott E. Page, a professor of complex systems, political science, and economics at the University of Michigan, \nis one of the leading researchers on diversity. Page emphasizes that people who look different may think the \nsame way and that people who look the same may think differently. But our sense of the situation is generally \ncorrect: social category diversity tends to lead to cognitive diversity. Page also shows the math of how \ncognitive diversity improves a team\u2019s results. \n \nPage describes specific tools that make up cognitive diversity and that allow an individual to contribute to \ncollective problem solving:11 \n \n\uf402 Information consists of facts about the world that you can represent as pieces or objects. Information is \nnot simply data. For data to be information the user must be able to interpret it and it must be meaningful. \nYou amass information throughout your life. You gather it from school, work, and family and friends. We \nall have different information. \n \n\uf402 Knowledge refers to structural comprehension. Examples include the ability to read, write, speak a \nlanguage, or prepare financial statements in advance of an audit. While information is mostly about facts, \nknowledge entails a theoretical or empirical understanding of patterns or how things work.  \n \n\uf402 Heuristics are the methods or techniques that you can use to solve problems and generate ideas. A \nheuristic is a rule of thumb that efficiently gets you to a solution. Having access to a diverse set of \nheuristics contributes to group results because not all heuristics work for all problems. They are non-\ncumulative so you can learn them in any order, and you can apply heuristics across fields.   \n \n\uf402 Representations capture the perspectives and categorizations you use when you think about or look at a \nsubject. Two people with different perspectives, or points of view, will not approach a problem in the same \nway. For example, if you ask someone to list the largest countries in the world, the response would \ndepend on the perspective of the person answering. One might draw a list based on land mass, another \nbased on population, and yet a third based on gross domestic product. Varied perspectives can yield \ninsights.  \n \nCategorizations allow you to make inferences. For example, you might classify Tiffany and Wal-Mart as \nretailers and Maserati and Volkswagen as automobile manufacturers. Someone with a different \ncategorization might put Tiffany and Maserati together as premium brands and Wal-Mart and Volkswagen \ntogether as low-cost brands. When members have different categorizations, teams can do a better job of \nassessing alternatives and anticipating outcomes.    \n \n\uf402 Mental models are simple but systematic frameworks that allow you to capture the essential features of \na problem you are trying to understand. Mental models are cognitive tools that are powerful because they \nsimplify the complex. But a mental model can also cause an individual to miss or reject relevant \ninformation. A team helps reduce that risk. \n"

A high level of cognitive diversity \nmeans the team has a large repertoire of cognitive tools. The more challenging the task, the more valuable \ncognitive diversity becomes.  \n \nThe discussion so far has emphasized the upside of diversity, or what Page calls the \u201cdiversity bonus.\u201d But \ndiversity also has a downside. Indeed, many studies show that teams with high social category diversity \nperform worse than teams with low diversity. The simple reason is that diversity can lead to social division, \nwhich stymies communication and encourages conflict. This limits the ability to capture the diversity bonus.  \n \nSocial scientists examined the impact of social category and cognitive diversity on the results for teams that \nmanage U.S. equity mutual funds.12 The scientists developed proxies for each type of diversity as neither is \neasy to measure. They chose gender and age to represent social category diversity and education level and \nindustry tenure to capture cognitive diversity.  \n \nUsing these proxies, the researchers examined the portfolio returns for more than 2,200 investment teams \nover 8 years. Investment teams are ideal for testing diversity because the task is clear, there are a large \nnumber of decisions that go into managing a portfolio, and the environment is consistent. They found that \ncognitive diversity added value and that social category diversity had a modestly negative influence. Age had \nno significant impact on results, which means the drag was due to gender diversity. Specifically, the \nresearchers found that a single-gender team would outperform a team consisting of three men and one \nwoman by 122 basis points per year.  \n \nOur take is that this result likely reflects ineffective team management. Indeed, even if you get the size and \ncomposition of the team right, you have to manage it properly to capture the value of diversity. The \npsychologists Elizabeth Mannix and Margaret Neale make this point even more dramatically when they write: \n\u201cto implement policies and practices that increase the diversity of the workforce without understanding how \ndiverse individuals can come together to form effective teams is irresponsible.\u201d13   \n \nAlphabet, Inc., the parent of Google, is a fairly young and highly analytical company. Members of the firm\u2019s \npeople analytics group examined the performance of 180 teams to determine what leads to success. They \nfound that who was on the team was less important than how the team interacted. In particular, they found \nthat effective teams shared five qualities: psychological safety, dependability, structure/clarity, meaning, and \nimpact.14  \n \nPsychological safety is the most foundational of these qualities. Members of a team that has psychological \nsafety are engaged, feel free to share their points of view, and are open-minded and inclusive. Perhaps the \nsingle biggest downfall of an ineffective team is that members do not say what they think. The main reason for \nthat is hierarchy. Individuals commonly defer to the highest paid person\u2019s opinion (HIPPO).15 Another reason \nis that members worry that others will dismiss or, worse, make fun of their points of view. This discourages \nintellectual risk-taking. An environment of psychological safety encourages varied views to surface and allows \nfor vigorous but constructive debate. A substantial body of research shows that a failure to share unique \ninformation leads to poorer decisions.16    \n \nDependability is also important. This means that team members show up on time, are prepared, and that \nothers can count on them. Structure and clarity means there is a process to achieve the team\u2019s clear goals. \nFinally, doing meaningful work that has impact is essential, along with autonomy and mastery, for creating \nintrinsic motivation.17 \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 11, 2017 \nAssembling a Dream Team \n7 \nPsychologists use general intelligence (g) to represent an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. The variable g measures \nthe positive correlation across a range of cognitive tasks. Individuals who score well on tests of general \nintelligence are consistently good at different types of problems, including those based on memory, math, and \nlanguage. Intelligence quotient (IQ) and g are closely related.   \n \nAnita Woolley, a professor of organizational behavior at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity, and some collaborators created a test of collective intelligence (c) for teams that is akin to a test of \ngeneral intelligence for individuals. The question is whether teams exhibit varied levels of c just as individuals \ndo for g. The answer is yes.18 \n \nThe researchers then determined what was behind a high c. Neither the average IQ of the group members nor \na member of the team with a high IQ explained the results. Three factors emerged. First, effective teams have \nbalanced communication. Specifically, teams that have members who listen, share their points of view, offer \nconstructive criticism, maintain open minds, and have a balanced flow of conversation perform better than \nteams that defer to the most intelligent or dominating members. In other words, these groups exhibited \npsychological safety.19 \n \nSecond, teams with a high c scored well in the test of \u201cReading the Mind in the Eyes.\u201d20 Developed by the \npsychologist Simon Baron-Cohen, this test measures the ability to understand the mental states of others. \nThis fits into a concept that psychologists call \u201ctheory of mind,\u201d which entails understanding the mental state of \nothers and recognizing how that state might be different from yours. Additional tests showed that groups that \nscored well on tests of theory of the mind did well even when team members collaborated online versus face \nto face.  \n \nFinally, teams with a higher percentage of women tend to have higher collective intelligence than teams with a \nhigher percentage of men (see exhibit 4). Women, on average, tend to be more balanced in their interaction \nthan men are. Women also do better than men, on average, on tests of theory of mind. These basic findings \nwere true of the subjects in these tests. But it is important to emphasize that for many psychological traits, the \ndifferences within each sex are larger than the differences across the sexes. As a result, there is little you can \nsay about any individual.  \n \nExhibit 4 also shows that the correlation between the percentage of women in the group and collective \nintelligence is not perfect. For example, the collective intelligence for groups of all men is higher than that of \ngroups with a low percentage of women. This is consistent with research that supports the notion that the \nmajority will often marginalize the contribution of a token member of a minority group.21 This also fits with the \nresults for mutual funds managed by teams with social category diversity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

More Women,\u201d Harvard Business Review, June 2011. \n \nThe combination of Google\u2019s analysis of teams in the real world and the experiments run by psychologists in \nthe lab point to the essential elements of effective team management. After management creates the team \nand defines the mission, great leaders do three things. To start, leaders commonly suppress their own point of \nview and share it at the end of a discussion, if at all. Because the team leader commonly holds the HIPPO, \nexpressing a view early in a deliberative or problem-solving context can quash the process of surfacing \nalternative points of view.  \n \nGreat leaders keep the team on track. We have all been to meetings, or been on committees, that veer from \nthe task at hand. Effective leaders steer the team back on course. Finally, great leaders solicit the points of \nview of all team members. For instance, extroverts and introverts commonly have different styles. Extroverts \noften hash things out by speaking. This can be effective but fills the airwaves of the meeting. Introverts may \nturn an idea in their head until they feel it is fully formed before they share it. As a result, the introverts may fail \nto contribute to the discussion unless the leader draws out their point.     \n \nWe now turn to our core topic: women in investment management. Today, roughly one in five funds has at \nleast one woman manager.22 Exhibit 5 shows the wide range of women fund managers by country, with a high \nof 30 percent in Singapore and a low of 7 percent in a few countries including Brazil. Women are only 10 \npercent of the fund managers in the United States, the largest market in the world. The exhibit also examines \nthe percentage of doctors and lawyers that are women. All of these jobs require substantial skill and provide \nrelatively high remuneration. In France, for example, women represent 21 percent of the fund managers \ncompared to 43 percent of the doctors and a slight majority of the lawyers. In the U.S., roughly one in three \ndoctors and lawyers are women but only one in ten run money.  \n \nWomen and teams of women only manage about two percent of the industry\u2019s assets and open-end funds. \nMen and teams of men run 74 percent of the assets and 78 percent of funds.

      "text": " \n \nMay 11, 2017 \nAssembling a Dream Team \n11 \nOliver Wyman, a consulting firm, found that many women in financial services face mid-career conflict. \nEssentially, many women conclude that the cost to their personal lives exceeds the benefit of continuing with \ntheir career. Factors that contribute to the negative cost-benefit ratio include the following:29 \n \n\uf402 Work options that are too rigid and a sense of stigma for using those options; \n \n\uf402 Insufficient support for family responsibilities, a sense shared by women and men; \n \n\uf402 Promotion processes that are not as predictable, transparent, and equitable as they could be; \n \n\uf402 Unequal pay; \n \n\uf402 Unconscious biases and traditional assumptions, which make the culture less attractive for women.  \n \nPerformance evaluation and compensation in the financial services industry is commonly based on long hours, \nwhich is especially difficult for women with children. Flexibility is greater for jobs at a lower level. Women also \nstruggle because of the perpetuation of traditional role models and cultural expectations. \n \nWomen exit the financial services industry in the middle of their careers at a rate that is higher than that of \ntheir male colleagues and significantly higher than that of other industries. Managers, senior managers, and \nexecutives in financial services who are women are 20 to 30 percent more likely to leave their employer than \ntheir peers in other industries. So while one-half of all financial services employees are women, they comprise \nonly 28 percent of senior management positions and 21 percent of executive positions.30 As you go up the \ncorporate ladder, the ratio of female to male employees goes down (see exhibit 7). \n \nExhibit 7: Financial Services Internal Labor Market \n \nSource: Women in the Financial Services Industry,\u201d Oliver Wyman, 2016. \n \n \n \n21%\n28%\n40%\n48%\n71%\n79%\n72%\n60%\n52%\n29%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nExecutive\nSenior Manager\nManager\nProfesional\nSupport Staff\nMen\nWomen\n"

The promotion rate for women and men is \nequivalent from senior manager to executive. But that rate is only six percent.  \n \nPay is also an issue. Nearly 20 years ago, Jane Waldfogel, a professor of social work at Columbia University, \nnoted that while the wage gap between men and women had narrowed, the gap between women with \nchildren and women without children had widened.31 Some jobs in the financial services industry demand \nemployees to put in consistent and long hours. In those cases, women on average earn less than men. For \nexample, women who are financial analysts earn 72 percent as much as men, and women who are financial \nadvisors earn 56 percent as much as men. This disparity means that some women may prefer to spend time \nwith their families or may pursue a career where compensation between the genders is more equal. \n \nThe culture of financial services appeals to some women more than others. Eighteen percent of the 135,000 \nChartered Financial Analyst (CFA) charterholders in the world are women. A survey found that women who \nare CFA charterholders are more focused on achievement and less oriented toward tradition and conformity \nthan women in the general population and men who are CFA charterholders. Women in finance are less risk \naverse and have more testosterone than women who choose not to go into finance.32 Many women and men \nshy away from finance because they are risk averse and feel the need to conform to social norms.  \n \nMen and women are also known to have different attitudes toward competition.33 In one experiment, men and \nwomen both solved problems in a noncompetitive setting and received money for every problem they solved. \nTheir performance was about the same. They then solved problems in a competitive setting, where pay was \nbased on the relative performance of all the participants. Men worked harder and did better. When given the \nchoice between the noncompetitive or competitive setting for the next round, around three-quarters of the \nmen selected the competitive environment while roughly one-third of the women did. Results relative to peers \nis an important and visible aspect of investment management.  \n \nThere is a fine line between motivation and bias. Bias may lead to fewer women money managers, which may \nmake the job appear to be less attractive and hence reduce the motivation for a woman to become a money \nmanager. While men commonly exhibit stronger gender biases than women, it is important to note that both \nmen and women show bias. For instance, both men and women associate leadership more with men than \nwith women.34  \n \nBias against women money managers shows up in a few ways. Actively-managed funds run by women tend \nto get fewer inflows than funds with similar performance run by men. One study of all U.S. equity mutual \nfunds run by a single manager over a decade and a half found that the growth rates of the funds run by \nwomen were one-third lower than those run by men as a result of lower inflows.35 Jane Buchan, founder and \nchief executive officer of PAAMCO, a large fund of funds, suggests that women have to outperform their male \ncounterparts by as much as 200 basis points to achieve similar inflows.36 \n \nFunds generally need to reach a certain scale to be viable. The inability to attract capital leads to a higher rate \nof failure for funds with at least one female manager than comparable funds run by men.37 As a consequence, \ngenerally only the highest-performing funds managed by women survive. To the degree that bias limits \nsuccess, it diminishes the motivation to enter into investment management.   \n \nBias also shows up in media mentions. Researchers studying the topic conclude, \u201cThe proportion of mentions \nof women in hedge funds to the total mentions of hedge funds is even smaller than the proportion of women-\nmanaged hedge funds to the total number of hedge funds.\u201d38 Women may take this to suggest that there is \nlittle room for women in leadership positions at hedge funds.  \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 11, 2017 \nAssembling a Dream Team \n13 \nBoth motivation and bias contribute to gender inequality in the investment industry. Enlightened organizations \nrecognize that teams are becoming more prominent in the workplace and can perform at a high level if they \nare properly constructed and managed. Organizations that embrace these ideas have the opportunity to \nsimultaneously embrace diversity and improve business results. \n \nConclusion \n \nThere has been a substantial shift in investment management from individual portfolio managers to teams \nrunning a fund. Teams do better than individuals on average, and teams of three deliver the best results. \n \nTeams should be diverse. Cognitive diversity is the key to solving problems although most organizations dwell \non social category diversity. Cognitive diversity is valuable because it provides more tools for solving problems. \nThis is the diversity bonus. There is reason to believe there is a positive correlation between social category \nand cognitive diversity, but there is little hard evidence to support the claim. The downside to diversity is if \npeople feel too different from one another, they may fail to engage each other to surface and vet alternatives. \nOften the voice of a token member, one woman among a group of men, for example, is unheard.   \n \nResearch by Google suggests that managing the team is even more important than assembling the perfect \none. The presence of psychological safety and dependability are two of the strongest predictors of success. \nPsychology experiments show that teams with a substantial percentage of women perform well and better \nthan teams with a similar percentage of males.      \n \n* * * \nWe offer special thanks to our summer intern, Julia Feldstein, who is a student at Yale University.

      "text": " \n \nMay 11, 2017 \nAssembling a Dream Team \n14 \nAppendix: Best Practices for Attracting Women into Investment Management \n \nTeams, rather than a single manager, are running more money than ever. A cognitively diverse team that is \nmanaged properly is the key to good decisions. While social category and cognitive diversity are distinct, there \nis good reason to believe they are positively correlated. If so, the goal of encouraging more participation by \nwomen in the investment management industry is not only socially desirable, it makes business sense.  \n \nAddressing the underrepresentation of women in finance should focus on entrance, retention, and mitigation. \nThe goal is a more gender equality that captures the diversity bonus without corroding group dynamics.  \n \nThe pipeline of applicants is the place to start. Job descriptions, interview methods, and media representation \nare all important. One way to reduce interview bias is through \u201cevaluation nudging.\u201d39 Iris Bohnet, a professor \nof behavioral economics at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, likes to tell the story of how orchestras \nreduced bias. Starting in the 1970s, the Boston Symphony Orchestra started to hold auditions where the \nmusician was behind a screen and the evaluators had only auditory evidence of skill. Other orchestras quickly \nfollowed suit. When the evaluators had no visual cues, including gender, and could only rely on sound to \nassess the musician, the proportion of orchestras made up of women soared by 30 percentage points.40  \n \nInvestment firms should seek to create job descriptions that use wording that is neutral rather than masculine \nor feminine. Most people have a subconscious bias that favors adjectives that support their gender\u2019s \nstereotypes. Since most employers seek to attract the best applicants from the labor pool, creating neutral job \ndescriptions is particularly useful.41  \n \nIf the survey of women who are CFA charterholders is representative of the women in the industry, there \nwould appear to be bias that deters some women from entering the field. These women cared little about \ntradition but a lot about achievement. Those attitudes are not the norm for the larger population of women in \nthe workforce. Since the data reveal that women are as good at running money as men are, hiring firms \nshould describe opportunities in a way that is neutral and hence more likely to appeal to women.  \n \nInstitutional investors generally assess the people, process, and performance when they hire a money \nmanager. There does not appear to be the equivalent to an audition behind a screen, but starting an \nevaluation with process and performance may be a step toward reducing bias.    \n \nConducting interviews properly is another part of evaluation nudging.42 Research shows that people, including \nthose in finance, prefer to hire someone like themselves. Further, we tend to vastly overestimate our ability to \nidentify worthy candidates. Not surprisingly, male bankers hire male bankers and female teachers hire female \nteachers. Sociologists call this \u201chomosocial reproduction.\u201d If your industry is dominated by men or women, \nhomosocial reproduction means you will get more of the same.  \n \nOne solution is to do a structured interview. This requires crafting questions that will reveal whether the \ncandidate has the necessary skill to succeed, asking all of the questions in the same order to each candidate, \nand keeping track of how well the candidate answers the questions in real time. Make sure the questions are \nas free from bias as you can. This allows you to compare answers and to create an overall score. Structured \ninterviews require more upfront time and effort but lead to better hiring decisions. \n   \nHaving successful and visible women in investment management can also play a role in encouraging women \nto enter the industry.43 Bohnet describes how a change in the law in India demonstrated the power of visibility. \nIn the early 1990s, India changed its constitution to require that one-third of the seats in village councils be \nreserved for women. Further, one-third of the council leaders had to be women.  \n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 11, 2017 \nAssembling a Dream Team \n15 \nThis created a natural experiment, as social scientists could compare the results for villages led by women to \nthose led by men. Villages run by women invested more in public services, heard their women speak up more \nthan before, saw more crimes reported, and realized a reduction in corruption. Seeing women in leadership \nroles changed the narrative and led to many positive outcomes. \n  \nFinancial services companies hire more men than women at all levels within the organization. But the dearth of \nwomen in the senior rates also reflects the fact that women are promoted at a lower rate, and have a higher \nrate of attrition, than men. So retaining women may be as important as hiring well. As the example from India \nshows, younger women assess their chances of success as higher when they see more women in visibly \npowerful positions. Seeing other women succeed in reaching their goal of attaining a position in senior \nmanagement suggests the benefit of a career in financial services may exceed the costs.  \n \nClaudia Goldin, a professor of economics at Harvard, distinguishes between jobs where pay grows linearly \nwith time and those where pay grows nonlinearly.44 More formally, nonlinearity means that pay grows as a \nconvex function of time, so the more hours an employee works, the more money he or she makes per unit of \ntime invested. Goldin notes that women are underrepresented relative to men in jobs that have nonlinear pay. \nNonlinear pay also explains the wage gap between women with children and women without children in \nfinance. Women without children can maintain a continuous schedule and therefore earn more than women \nwith less flexible schedules. \n \nThe problem can extend beyond the need to work lots of hours to the need to maintain appearances. In many \nareas of finance, including investment banking, some professional cultures value face time more than output.  \nThe need to have your boss see you work is more important than the ability to actually produce work.  \n \nIn one study, conducted in Australia, women bankers said their male colleagues worked the same number of \nhours as they did.45 The difference was the men would take long lunch breaks and go to the gym during \nworking hours and then stay late to make up for the missed hours. The women, especially those with children, \ngot their work done efficiently and left the office at an earlier hour. The productivity was the same, but the \nextra hours at the office at night garnered more recognition from superiors. This is another example of a bias \nthat favors men, who tend to have flexibility, over women, who are less flexible as they raise a family. \n \nThe investment management industry can mitigate this problem, at least for some jobs, by emulating sectors \nsuch as healthcare and retail. For example, pharmacists have a fairly linear pay scale and women with children \ncan work part time as they raise their children.  \n \nLast, the finance industry can better manage the negative effects of gender diversity. This starts with effective \nteam leadership. One technique is to create a \u201cbridge\u201d between team members based on social ties, common \nvalues, or culture.46 Bridges encourage psychological safety, thus allowing the team to hear and assess a \nwider range of viewpoints.  \n \nImproved management also means detecting and managing bias. Bohnet tells the story of female \nstockbrokers at the largest firms in the U.S. who earned 60 percent of what their male colleagues did. Since \nthese professionals were paid on commission, the natural conclusion is that the women were not as productive \nas the men. On closer examination, it became clear that the women were given inferior opportunities, \nincluding smaller and less attractive accounts. This is called \u201cperformance support bias.\u201d When the women \nwere given better accounts, they performed just as well as their male counterparts. In both finance and \nacademia, women generated the same results as men when the playing field was level.47  \n \n \n"
