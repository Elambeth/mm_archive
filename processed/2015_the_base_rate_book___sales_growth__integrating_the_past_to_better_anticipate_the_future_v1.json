      "text": " \n \nMay 4, 2015 \n \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nOn an earnings call in February 2015, Elon Musk, the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Tesla \nMotors, set out a path for the company to reach a market capitalization of about $700 billion in 10 years.2 \nThat approached the size of Apple Inc., which had the largest market capitalization of any company in the \nworld at the time.   \n \nHere is Musk\u2019s math. If you assume sales in 2015 of $6 billion (the current consensus is around $5.7 billion) \nand sales growth of 50 percent compounded annually, you get about $345 billion in 2025. If you then take a \n10 percent net income margin and apply a price-earnings multiple of 20, you get very close to $700 billion.    \n \nThe obvious question is: How likely is it that Tesla will achieve those figures? The natural way to answer the \nquestion is to roll up your sleeves and do an analysis from the bottom up. How many cars can they sell? How \nmuch will each cost? In which countries can they expand sales? What other businesses can they move into? \nHow profitable will the business be? And so forth. \n \nResearchers who study forecasts of this nature find that two biases, optimism and overconfidence, are \ncommon. Optimism about personal predictions has value for encouraging perseverance in the face of \nchallenges, but distorts assessments of likely outcomes.3 For example, notwithstanding that only about 50 \npercent of new businesses survive five or more years, a survey of thousands of entrepreneurs found that more \nthan 8 of 10 of them rated their odds of success at 70 percent or higher, and fully one-third did not allow for \nany probability of failure at all.4 The bottom line on optimism: \u201cPeople frequently believe that their preferred \noutcomes are more likely than is merited.\u201d5 \n \nOverconfidence bias also distorts the ability to make sound predictions. This bias reveals itself when an \nindividual\u2019s confidence in his or her subjective judgments is higher than the objective outcomes warrant. For \ninstance, nearly two thousand people answered 50 true-false questions and provided a confidence level for \neach. They were correct about 60 percent of the time but indicated confidence in their answers of 70 \npercent.6 Most people, including financial analysts, place too much weight on their own information.7  \n \nThe classic way that overconfidence shows up in forecasts is with ranges of outcomes that are too narrow. As \na case in point, researchers asked chief financial officers to predict the results for the stock market, including \nhigh and low growth rates within which the executives were 80 percent sure the results would land. They were \ncorrect only one-third of the time.8  \n \nExhibit 1 shows how this bias manifests in forecasts. Both are distributions of sales growth rates annualized \nover three years for roughly 1,500 public companies in the U.S.9 The distribution with the lower peak reflects \nthe actual results over the past two decades, and the distribution with the higher peak is the set of growth \nrates that analysts are currently forecasting.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 4, 2015 \n \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n3 \nExhibit 1: Overconfidence \u2013 Range of Sales Growth Rates Too Narrow \n \nSource: FactSet.  \nNote: I/B/E/S consensus estimates as of May 4, 2015. \n \nConsistent with the overconfidence bias, the range of expected outcomes is vastly narrower than what the \nresults of the past suggest is reasonable. Forecasts are commonly too optimistic and too narrow. Behavioral \nbiases and distortions introduced by incentives are the best explanations for the pattern of faulty forecasts.10    \n \nGiven these insights, how might we assess the plausibility of Musk\u2019s assumptions? One way would be to delve \ninto the specifics for Tesla and come up with conceivable scenarios. We might even employ an analogy: Tesla \nhas a disruptive innovation and a dynamic leader as did Apple, the company Tesla hopes to match in market \ncapitalization.   \n \nBut knowing that we are prone to optimism and overconfidence suggests that we should introduce techniques \nto manage those biases. By far the most useful way to do that is to examine the experience of many \ncompanies over time, the base rate, and thoughtfully integrate that rate with our own view. This is not our \ntypical approach. As Daniel Kahneman, the eminent psychologist, notes bluntly, \u201cPeople who have information \nabout an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs.\u201d11     \n \nWe can certainly think about Tesla\u2019s individual prospects in assessing the likelihood that the company will \nachieve those figures. But Kahneman\u2019s approach would have us look at the sample of all the companies that \nhad $6 billion of sales, adjusted for inflation, to determine how many grew 50 percent compounded annually \nfor ten years. The answer for the past two decades: zero. In fact, if we lower the starting sales base to $700 \nmillion, there was not an instance of growth at that rate in a population of 6,700. While Musk allowed that \nthese were assumptions only, he added, \u201cI bet that they do occur.\u201d    \n \nThough decision scientists have known for a long time that the proper use of base rates improves the quality \nof forecasts, the technique remains remarkably underused.12 We believe this reflects the human desire for a \nnarrative. Causality is clear in stories about the specifics, which makes those scenarios vivid. Base rates, on \nthe other hand, are largely antiseptic and hence less appealing to the mind.    \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n<(25)\n(25)-(20)\n(20)-(15)\n(15)-(10)\n(10)-(5)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n25-30\n30-35\n35-40\n40-45\n>45\nFrequency (Percent)\n3-Year Sales CAGR (Percent)\nBase Rates\nCurrent Estimates\n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 4, 2015 \n \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n4 \nBase Rates of Sales Growth \n \nAn investor\u2019s primary task is to determine whether the expectations for future financial performance, as \nimplied by the stock price, are too optimistic or pessimistic relative to how the company is likely to perform. In \nother words, the intelligent investor seeks gaps between expectations and fundamentals.13 This approach \ndoes not require forecasts of pinpoint accuracy, but rather only judgments as to whether the expectations \nembedded in the shares are too high or low.  \n \nSales growth is the most important driver of corporate value.14 As a result, we analyze the distribution of sales \ngrowth rates for the constituents of the S&P 1500 Index over a 21-year period from 1994-2014. This sample \nrepresents roughly 90 percent of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market. We identify the members of the \nindex at the beginning of each year and then calculate the compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of sales for \nthe subsequent 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 years for each firm. We adjust all of the sales figures to remove the \neffects of inflation, which translates all of the numbers to 2014 dollars. So no company is in our sample until it \nis included in the S&P 1500, but once it is in the index it stays in our sample even if it exits the index.  \n \nExhibit 2 shows the results for the full sample. In the panel on the left, the rows show sales growth rates and \nthe columns reflect time periods. Say you want to know what percent of the universe grew sales at a CAGR of \n20-25 percent for three years. You start with row marked \u201c20-25\u201d and slide to the right to find the column \u201c3-\nYr.\u201d There, you\u2019ll see that 4.4 percent of the companies achieved that rate of growth. The panel on the right \nshows the sample sizes for each growth rate and time period, allowing us to see where the 4.4 percent comes \nfrom: 1,060 instances out of the total of 23,914 (1,060/23,914 = 4.4 percent).      \n \nExhibit 2: Base Rates of Sales Growth (CAGR) for the S&P 1500 (1994-2014) \n \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: CAGR = compound annual growth rate. \n \nExhibit 3 is the distribution for the three-year sales growth rate. This shows, in a graph, what the numbers say \nin exhibit 2. The mean, or average, growth rate was 6.2 percent per year and the median growth rate was 4.5 \npercent. The median is a better indicator of the central location of the results because the distribution is \nskewed to the right. The standard deviation, 16.4 percent, gives an indication of the width of the bell curve. \n \nFull Universe\nFull Universe\nCAGR (%)\n1-Yr\n3-Yr\n5-Yr\n10-Yr\n20-Yr\nCAGR (%)\n1-Yr\n3-Yr\n5-Yr\n10-Yr\n20-Yr\n<(25)\n4.0%\n1.7%\n1.1%\n0.5%\n0.1%\n<(25)\n1,153\n406\n205\n56\n1\n(25)-(20)\n1.6%\n1.0%\n0.7%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n(25)-(20)\n471\n246\n126\n14\n1\n(20)-(15)\n2.6%\n1.8%\n1.4%\n0.7%\n0.1%\n(20)-(15)\n748\n425\n261\n75\n1\n(15)-(10)\n3.9%\n3.7%\n2.9%\n1.4%\n0.4%\n(15)-(10)\n1,147\n875\n564\n149\n4\n(10)-(5)\n7.0%\n7.7%\n7.0%\n5.4%\n1.8%\n(10)-(5)\n2,050\n1,842\n1,355\n574\n21\n(5)-0\n12.7%\n14.7%\n16.5%\n16.8%\n11.5%\n(5)-0\n3,695\n3,508\n3,184\n1,796\n131\n0-5\n17.6%\n21.6%\n24.6%\n30.8%\n43.0%\n0-5\n5,138\n5,157\n4,748\n3,285\n488\n5-10\n15.4%\n17.2%\n18.7%\n23.3%\n25.9%\n5-10\n4,489\n4,104\n3,606\n2,485\n294\n10-15\n10.6%\n11.2%\n11.7%\n11.7%\n11.8%\n10-15\n3,094\n2,689\n2,260\n1,251\n134\n15-20\n6.9%\n7.0%\n6.9%\n5.5%\n3.9%\n15-20\n2,004\n1,672\n1,332\n589\n44\n20-25\n4.7%\n4.4%\n3.5%\n2.0%\n0.6%\n20-25\n1,358\n1,060\n677\n211\n7\n25-30\n3.2%\n2.6%\n2.1%\n0.7%\n0.6%\n25-30\n929\n625\n397\n80\n7\n30-35\n2.1%\n1.6%\n1.0%\n0.4%\n0.1%\n30-35\n610\n380\n192\n45\n1\n35-40\n1.6%\n1.2%\n0.6%\n0.2%\n0.2%\n35-40\n469\n282\n116\n26\n2\n40-45\n1.2%\n0.8%\n0.4%\n0.2%\n0.0%\n40-45\n349\n180\n84\n18\n0\n>45\n4.9%\n1.9%\n0.9%\n0.3%\n0.0%\n>45\n1,416\n463\n181\n27\n0\nMean\n8.8%\n6.2%\n5.3%\n4.6%\n4.9%\nTotal\n29,120 23,914 19,288 10,681 1,136\nMedian\n5.2%\n4.5%\n4.2%\n4.1%\n4.2%\nStDev\n50.3%\n16.4%\n13.1%\n9.6%\n6.7%\nObservations\nBase Rates\n"

The best way to do that is to break the universe into deciles based \non a company\u2019s sales in the prior year. Within each size decile, we sort the observations of growth rates into \nbins in increments of 5 percentage points (except for the tails). The population includes companies that are \nnow dead.15  \n \nThere is a modest survivorship bias because each sample only includes the firms that survived for that \nspecified time. For a company to be included in our 20-year sample, for instance, requires 20 years of survival. \nTo give you some sense of this effect, the survivorship rates are 92 percent for 1 year, 84 percent for 3 years, \n76 percent for 5 years, 59 percent for 10 years, and 38 percent for 20 years. \n \nThe heart of this analysis is exhibit 4, which shows each decile, the total population, and an additional analysis \nof mega companies (those with sales in excess of $50 billion). Here\u2019s how you use the exhibit. Determine the \nbase sales level for the company that you want to model. Then go to the appropriate decile based on that size. \nYou now have the proper reference class and the distribution of growth rates for the various time horizons.   \n \nLet\u2019s use Tesla as an example. Elon Musk said he hopes to grow sales 50 percent per year for the next \ndecade from a sales base of $6 billion. We first find the correct reference class. In this case, it\u2019s the decile \nthat has a sales base between $6 and 13 billion. Next we examine the row of growth that is marked \u201c>45,\u201d \nrepresenting a sales growth rate of 45 percent or more. Going out to the column under \u201c10-Yr,\u201d we see that \nno companies achieved this feat. Indeed, we have to go down to 35-40 percent growth to see any companies, \nand even there it is only one-fifth of 1 percent of the sample. \n \nIn total, exhibit 4 shows results for 55 reference classes (11 size ranges times 5 time horizons) that should \ncover the vast majority of possible outcomes for sales growth. The appendix contains the sample sizes for \neach of the reference classes. We will show how to incorporate these base rates into your forecasts for sales \ngrowth in a moment, but for now it\u2019s useful to acknowledge the utility of these data as an analytical guide and \na valuable reality check.  \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n<(25)\n(25)-(20)\n(20)-(15)\n(15)-(10)\n(10)-(5)\n(5)-0\n0-5\n5-10\n10-15\n15-20\n20-25\n25-30\n30-35\n35-40\n40-45\n>45\nFrequency (Percent)\nCAGR (Percent)\n"

The first is that the mean and median growth rates decline as firm size increases, as \ndoes the standard deviation of the growth rates. This point has been well established empirically.16 Exhibit 5 \nshows this pattern for annualized growth rates over three years. The lesson is to temper expectations about \nsales growth for large companies. \n \nExhibit 5: Growth Rates and Standard Deviations Decline with Size \n \nSource: FactSet. \nNote: Growth rates are annualized over three years; mega companies have sales in excess of $50 billion in the base year. \n \nNext, sales growth follows gross domestic product (GDP) reasonably closely (see Exhibit 6). The correlation between \nGDP growth and the median sales growth in the same year is strong, with a coefficient of 0.80. Over the 21-year \nperiod, U.S. GDP grew at 2.5 percent per year, adjusted for inflation, with a standard deviation of 1.8 percent. \nCorporate sales growth was higher than that of the broader economy for a few reasons, including mergers and \nacquisitions, international growth, and currency swings.17   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nMega\nUniverse\nDecile (Smallest to Largest by Sales)\nMean\nMedian\nStandard Deviation\n"

Whereas \na decline in sales need not be bad if it occurs for the right reasons, few analysts or corporate leaders project shrinking \nsales unless there is a clear strategy of divestiture.18 \n \nUsing Base Rates to Model Growth \n \nWe have established that there are two ways of making a forecast. You can do bottom-up research, which is the most \nnatural method, or you can turn to a base rate. The research in decision making shows that the bottom-up approach is \nsubject to biases and that incorporating the base rate generally improves the accuracy of the forecast. Yet we don\u2019t \nwant to lean too much on either our own analysis or the base rate. We want to combine the two intelligently.  \n \nThere is a technique to combine the two approaches, which we will apply to our sales growth data.19 Correlation is the \nkey to the method. Correlation measures the degree of linear relationship between variables in a pair of distributions. \nThe value of a correlation can fall between -1.0 (the rise in one variable perfectly correlates with the fall of the other) \nand 1.0 (both variables move in tandem). A zero correlation indicates randomness. We will examine a single variable, \nsales growth, measured over time and all of the correlations are positive.  \n \nIf the correlation between two distributions is high, then what happened before gives you a really good sense of what \nwill follow. For example, the correlation for cash flow return on investment (CFROI\u00ae) for companies in the consumer \nstaples sector is about 0.90 from one year to the next.20 That means if you know Nestl\u00e9\u2019s CFROI from last year, you \ncan forecast it this year with a great deal of accuracy. The bottom-up work is highly relevant. \n \nIf the correlation is low, what happened before provides no inkling of what will happen next. Take the annual total \nshareholder returns for the S&P 500 as a case.21 The correlation from year to year, from 1928 through 2014, is \nessentially zero. Telling you last year\u2019s return provides no help in forecasting the return for this year. Your best forecast \nis the average of the reference class.  \n-8%\n-6%\n-4%\n-2%\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\nSales Growth\nGDP Growth\n"

      "text": " \n \nMay 4, 2015 \n \nThe Base Rate Book \u2013 Sales Growth \n10 \nThe basic idea is that the correlation determines how you should weight the bottom-up analysis and the base rate. For \nNestl\u00e9, a sensible forecast is nine parts last year\u2019s CFROI and one part last year\u2019s average sector CFROI, the base \nrate. For your S&P 500 forecast, you should place minimal weight on what happened last year and rely largely on the \naverage return since 1928, the base rate. \n \nStudying base rates for sales growth is logical for two reasons. First, sales growth is the most important driver of value \nfor most companies. Second, sales growth has a higher correlation from year to year than does earnings growth, \nwhich is the most commonly discussed item on the income statement.22 Sales growth is important and more \npredictable than profit growth.  \n \nExhibit 7 shows that the correlation coefficient is 0.27 for the year-to-year sales growth rate. We start with the \nconstituents of the S&P 1500 Index as of 1994, and use the figures from 1994 through 2014.23 Specifically, we \ncorrelate the growth rates of 1994 with those of 1995, 1995 with 1996, et cetera. It turns out that the correlation \ndoesn\u2019t change much if we consider only companies with sales in excess of $20 billion.  \n \nExhibit 7: Correlation of One-Year Sales Growth Rates \n \nSource: FactSet. \n \nThe correlations tend to decline as we consider longer time periods, which comes as no surprise. Exhibit 8 shows the \ncorrelations for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year horizons for the full population of companies. The lesson is that the base rate \nfor the reference classes, the median growth rate, should receive the majority of the weight for forecasts of three \nyears or longer. In fact, you might start with the base rate and seek reasons to move away from it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-75%\n0%\n75%\n-75%\n0%\n75%\nSales Growth Following Year\nSales Growth Prior Year\nr = 0.27\n"

But for a major corporation to predict that its per-share earnings will grow over the long term \nat, say, 15% annually is to court trouble. \n \nThat\u2019s true because a growth rate of that magnitude can only be maintained by a very small \npercentage of large businesses. Here\u2019s a test: Examine the record of, say, the 200 highest \nearning companies from 1970 or 1980 and tabulate how many have increased per-share \nearnings by 15% annually since those dates. You will find that only a handful have. I would \nwager you a very significant sum that fewer than 10 of the 200 most profitable companies \nin 2000 will attain 15% annual growth in earnings-per-share over the next 20 years. \n \nThe problem arising from lofty predictions is not just that they spread unwarranted optimism. Even \nmore troublesome is the fact that they corrode CEO behavior. Over the years, Charlie and I have \nobserved many instances in which CEOs engaged in uneconomic operating maneuvers so that they \ncould meet earnings targets they had announced. Worse still, after exhausting all that operating \nacrobatics would do, they sometimes played a wide variety of accounting games to \u201cmake the \nnumbers.\u201d These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing: Once a company moves \nearnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to engage in \nfurther accounting maneuvers that must be even more \u201cheroic.\u201d These can turn fudging into fraud. \n(More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.) \n \nCharlie and I tend to be leery of companies run by CEOs who woo investors with fancy predictions. A few of \nthese managers will prove prophetic \u2014 but others will turn out to be congenital optimists, or even charlatans. \nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not easy for investors to know in advance which species they are dealing with. \n \nNaturally, not all of the examples are success stories. The Eastman Kodak Company and Nokia Corporation are two \ncompanies that have struggled in recent years as the result of technological change. Kodak had a dominant, and \nhighly profitable, franchise in photo film that came under severe pressure as digital photography took off. The \ncompany filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 and continued to restructure the business. In the decade ended 2014, \nKodak\u2019s sales declined at a compounded annual rate of close to 19 percent. Part of this decline is attributable to \ndivestitures. \n \nNokia, once a leader in the smartphone as well as the traditional mobile phone market, saw its lead at the top end \ntoppled by Apple and Samsung and at the low end by Asian manufacturers. Sales for the 10 years ended 2014 \nshrank 9 percent compounded annually. Nokia\u2019s sales in 2008 were more than four times those of 2014, with \ndivestitures again playing a role.   \n \nExhibit 12 shows the sales and gross profit margin for Kodak and Nokia from 2004 through 2014. These cases show \nhow once strong and proud companies can stumble, and ultimately shrink. While the distribution of sales growth rates \nis skewed to the right, it\u2019s important to recognize that plenty of businesses also shrink. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
