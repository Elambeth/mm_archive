      "text": "Absolute Power\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nExecutive Summary\nThe dot.com phenomenon has been widely derided as a \u201cbubble.\u201d Some savvy\nmarket watchers have noted that many industries that have had a profound\nimpact on the economy initially spawned a multitude of competitors. But these\nindustries, which include airlines and automobiles, ultimately witnessed little value\ncreation. Unlike the automobile and airline industries of yesteryear\u2014in which\nfirms competed for product market share\u2014most on-line firms are competing for\nneural mind share. However, their plight will be the same. Just like many of their\n\u201creal world\u201d brethren, a significant number of on-line firms will either fail or be\nabsorbed by other competitors in the coming years.\nIn Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, all the children are said to be above average.\n1\n(See notes at end of text.) While refraining from comment about the strength or\nbeauty of the parents, our data show that the on-line offspring of venture capital\nfirms are now eagerly snapped up by the public markets and are subject to an\neven more ruthless statistical distribution than the bell curve\u2014the power law.\nPower laws are distribution functions for measurable quantities, like how many\nearthquakes there are of a particular size or the number of cities within a given\nrange of populations. Nascent scientific study of the Internet has revealed that it\nis subject to the same statistical regularities that govern these other \u201cnatural\u201d\nphenomena, and as we will see, these regularities have important implications for\nthe future of dot-com hopefuls.\nPowerful Web\nDespite being convinced of the disruptive nature of the on-line medium\n2, we\nbelieve that value creation for most Internet companies will be restricted owing to\nthe difficulty of achieving sufficient scale. This begs some important questions.\nWho has the advantage in achieving this scale? Does the Internet, as a self-\norganizing system, have any interesting or unexpected characteristics?\nUnderneath the Internet\u2019s apparent complexity and confusion, there exists hidden\norder. Web pages are the building blocks of the World Wide Web, and every\npage is identified by a unique URL (uniform resource locator). Studies of the new\nmedium have demonstrated that Web pages are distributed among sites\naccording to a universal power law: many sites have very few pages, and very\nfew sites have many pages.\n3\nThe right side of Figure 1 shows the distribution of site sizes for two \u201ccrawls,\u201d one\nconducted by Alexa and the other by Infoseek, covering a large number of sites.\nBoth data sets illustrate a power law. That is, on a log-log scale the distribution of\nthe number of pages per site appears as a straight line.\n4 The existence of a\npower law in the growth of the Web carries some profound implications. One\nimportant suggestion is that the expected number of sites of a particular size can\nbe estimated by extrapolating the power law to any large value of \u201cn.\u201d For\nexample, if data were collected from 250,000 sites, the probability of finding a site\nwith a million pages would be 10\n-4, or one in ten thousand.\n5 It seems that size is\nhard to come by.\n"

Researchers at Xerox PARC found that\nfor all the sites in their sample, as well as sites in specific categories of the\nsample, the distribution of visitors per site followed a universal power law.\n6 As\nwas the case with the number of pages per site, the results for the number of\nvisitors per site indicate that many sites have very few users, and a few sites\nhave very many users. This deceptively simple assertion belies a powerful\nstatistical truth. Very few companies have met with success on-line, and we\nbelieve fewer still will succeed on-line in the future. Such a disproportionate\ndistribution of user volume among sites is characteristic of winner-take-all\nmarkets. A select few reap all the rewards, and latecomers confront serious\ndifficulties cracking the \u201clineup.\u201d The percentage of total volume accounted for by\nthe top sites (measured by unique users) is displayed below.\nTable 1\nPercentage Volume by User\n% Sites\nAll sites\nAdult Sites\nEducational Sites\n0.1%\n32.36%\n1.4%\n2.81%\n1%\n55.63%\n15.83%\n23.76%\n5%\n74.81%\n41.75%\n59.50%\n10%\n82.26%\n59.29%\n74.48%\n50%\n94.92%\n90.76%\n96.88%\nSource: Xerox PARC, data from December 1, 1997.\n.\n"

Although the ability to attract users does not ipso\nfacto lead to monetization of traffic, much less profitability, it is a necessary\nprecondition. With Internet market share beholden to these strong regularities,\nthe implications for competition\u2014and investors sizing up the competition\u2014are\nenormous.\nModels that account for the observed power law behavior indicate a low\nprobability that newly established sites will attract a significant number of users.\n7\nTaking Web sites and ranking them on the horizontal axis according to\npopularity\u2014as determined by the number of unique users\u2014and then placing\npageviews on the vertical axis, results in a straight line when using a double\nlogarithmic scale.\n 8\nThis so-called Zipf distribution\n9 is a power law and has been observed in the\ndistribution of words used in a natural language. Zipf-like distributions have also\nbeen seen in many other realms, including earthquakes, city sizes, and the\nvariation of cotton prices. Extremities become apparent when Zipf distributions\nare plotted on a linear scale. (See the bottom of Figure 3.) A few elements score\nvery high, a medium number of elements get middle-of-the-road scores, and an\nenormous number of elements score very low (the long tail of the distribution\nwhich hugs the x-axis).\nKnowledge Is Power\nWe have observed that success begets success ever since the dawn of recorded\nhistory.\n10 Thrust into the modern context of massively interconnected networks,\nthis hoary truism takes on a powerful new form. We now outline some of the\nreasons power laws are persistent on the Internet. On-line, popularity is\ndetermined by a collective process that has been called \u201csocial search.\u201d\n11 That is,\nreferrals from friends, relatives, and acquaintances drive growth and traffic.\nSearch Costs\nWith only a Web address to differentiate itself from the crowd, an on-line firm\nnaturally flirts with obscurity. The importance of awareness can be traced back to\nthe high search costs associated with locating companies in Internet markets.\nThese costs stem from the sheer volume of competing information available. A\nvirtual avalanche of marketing studies have supported the notion that consumers\nreach a point of diminishing return when confronted with ever-increasing choice.\n12\nFor example, in the book business over the last 15 years, consumers have been\nconfronted with a greater selection than in any other period in history. Ironically,\ndespite the abundance of offerings, the share of book sales represented by the\n30 top-selling hard cover books in America nearly doubled from 1986 to 1996.\n13\nThe brand name author as \u201csafe haven\u201d is mirrored in the on-line distribution\ndata, as Internet users flock to the same sites in order to reduce search costs.\nDifferentiation on-line is becoming more and more challenging as the number of\nentrants to the market increases daily. In an environment in which record-\nbreaking sums are being allocated for traditional advertising, one recent article\n(Wall Street Journal) quipped, \u201cAmericans are being dot-commed to death.\u201d The\nfallout from this overwhelming assault is that many consumers are just not paying\nattention. After all, it\u2019s hard to remember whether that ad was for Pets.com,\nPetstore.com, PETsMART.com, or Petopia.com.\n14\nLinks with the Past\nNew sites tend to link to already popular sites in a bid for increased traffic. This\nresults in a rich-get-richer phenomenon, whereby already popular sites get even\nmore popular. Studies conducted at the University of Notre Dame have found that\nthe proportion of Web pages with many outside links\u2014directing traffic to that\n"

However, this is not the case. A recent\nsurvey conducted by Forrester Research showed that retailers with on-line\ndistribution deals generated 36% of their site traffic and 33% of their sales\nthrough links with firms that rank among the top-50 in volume.\n16\nStudying the links into and out from the 325,729 pages on Notre Dame\u2019s domain\n\u201cnd.edu,\u201d physicists discovered that the pages follow a power law distribution.\n(Other domains saw similar results.) The number of pages with n links was\nproportional to 1/n 2 . For example, pages with 20 links were one quarter as\nfrequent as pages with 10 links. This is strong evidence in support of the Web as\na self-organizing system.\nBalance of Power\nFigure 2\nTrailing Venture Capital Money Flows\n$-\n$2\n$4\n$6\n$8\n$10\n$12\n$14\n$16\n$18\n$20\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\nQ1 99\nQ2 99\nQ3 99\n1999\nDollars (billions)\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n% Internet\nTotal $\nInternet $\n% Internet\nSource: VentureOne Corporation and CSFB analysis.\nOver the last three years venture capital firms have put a staggering amount of\nmoney to work. In the third quarter of 1999 alone, a record shattering $8.6 billion\nflowed into the coffers of over 750 venture-backed firms. Almost two-thirds of\nthese investment dollars were earmarked for Internet companies, reflecting an\nupward spiral in the overall percentage of venture capital dollars allocated to on-\nline firms. In 1995 roughly 12% of total venture capital outlays went to on-line\ncompanies. For the first three quarters of 1999, that percentage skyrocketed to\n60%, nearly tripling the total investment dollars distributed in all of 1995. (See\nFigure 2.)\nWith evidence mounting to support the idea that the on-line medium is a winner-\ntake-all market, it would seem that many venture capital firms have placed\nsubstantial amounts of investment dollars in harms way. Pundits would observe\nthat the \u201cbubble-like\u201d valuations awarded in the public markets could continue to\nbail out the venture capital firms. Dubious of market inefficiency on such a grand\nscale, we plotted the market capitalization of an index of pure play dot.com\ncompanies. The results are stunning. Far from encountering systematic\novervaluation, we observed a power law distribution in the market capitalization of\nthe largest 150 Internet firms in our index.\n17\n"

The percentage of total market capitalization contributed\nby the top on-line firms is remarkably similar to the percentage of total volume\naccounted for by the top sites in the individual segments in Table 1.

The data do not support this view. Our findings do show that\nthe market capitalization of the Internet is dominated by a handful of leaders.\nThis is consistent with the winner-take-all outcomes implied by the power law\ndistributions.\nIt is important to underscore that this analysis provides compelling evidence that\nthe market is valuing Internet companies relatively correctly. These data provide\nno evidence, however, that the market is valuing the sector correctly on an\nabsolute basis (either overvaluation or undervaluation).\n"
