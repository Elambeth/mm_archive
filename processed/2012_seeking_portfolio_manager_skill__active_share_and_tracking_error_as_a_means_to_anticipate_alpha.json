      "text": " \nPage 2 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nEquity markets are generally considered to be informationally efficient, which means that all \nrelevant information is impounded in prices. Because it is difficult for an active manager to \ngenerate returns in excess of that of the market after an adjustment for risk, a common \nprescription is to turn to passive management in the form of index funds. This is a sensible \napproach for many investors. But the case for passive management has logical limits. For \nexample, in economics there is an idea called the macro consistency test, which asks, \u201cWould \nthis approach work if everyone pursued it?\u201d The answer for passive investing is no. Some \npercentage of investors must be active in order to ensure that information is translated into prices. \nIndeed, recent research shows that active management enhances, and passive management \nreduces, the informational efficiency of stock prices.2  \n \nIn 1980, a pair of economists, Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz, wrote a seminal paper \ncalled, \u201cOn the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets.\u201d 3 Their basic argument is that \nthere is a cost to making sure that prices properly reflect information. If there is no return for \nobtaining and trading on information, there is no economic incentive to do so. They propose that \n\u201cthose who do expend resources to obtain information do receive compensation\u201d in the form of \nexcess returns. In-depth studies show that active managers do indeed generate gross returns in \nexcess of those of the market.4 However, those returns are less than the fees that managers \ncharge. Careful studies of active management also reveal differential skill\u2014that is, luck alone \ndoes not explain the results in investment management and a small percentage of managers \ndeliver positive excess returns after all costs.5   \n \nOf course the challenge is to identify skillful managers ex ante. There are two major approaches \nto assessing manager skill.6 The first relies on an analysis of prior returns. The effectiveness of \nthis approach relies on extracting useful information about skill by considering a sufficiently long \ntime period and by controlling for various factors, including the types of risks the manager has \nassumed and the systematic versus idiosyncratic risk exposure. Returns-based assessments \nrarely make sufficient and appropriate adjustments to distill skill from the reported results. Further, \nsimulations show that even skillful managers\u2014those endowed with an attractive ex-ante Sharpe \nratio\u2014can deliver poor returns for years as a consequence of luck.7 In other words, even skillful \nmanagers won\u2019t always beat their benchmarks and unskillful managers can do well for stretches \nof time as the result of randomness.   \n \nThe second approach to testing manager skill is look at the portfolio holdings and characteristics \nof managers. Characteristics might include a portfolio manager\u2019s age, education, and the size of \nhis or her fund. The focus on portfolio construction and holdings allows for a more precise \nassessment of a manager\u2019s process. The focus of this discussion will be on active share, a \nconcept developed by a pair of finance professors named Martijn Cremers and Antti Petajisto, as \na means to increase the probability of identifying a skillful manager in advance.8         \n \nWhat Is the Characteristic of a Valuable Statistic? \n \nThe worlds of finance and investing are awash in statistics that purport to reflect what\u2019s going on. \nStatistics that are useful have two features: reliability and validity.9 Reliability means that results \nare highly correlated10 from one period to the next. For example, a student who did poorly on a \ntest last week does poorly this week, and the student who did well last week does well this week. \nHigh reliability and a large contribution of skill generally go together. Finance researchers use the \nterm \u201cpersistence,\u201d which is the same as reliability. \n \nThe second feature is validity, which means the result is correlated with the desired outcome. For \ninstance, say a baseball team\u2019s offensive goal is to score as many runs as possible. An analysis \nwould show that on-base percentage is better correlated with run production than batting average \nis. So an enlightened manager would prefer on-base percentage to batting average as a statistic \nof offensive production, all else being equal. \n \n"

      "text": " \nPage 3 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nThe returns-based approach skips the two steps of reliability and validity and goes directly to the \nresults. It doesn\u2019t pause to ask: what leads to excess returns? It just measures the outcome. This \napproach works in fields where skill determines results and luck is no big deal. For example, if \nyou have five runners of disparate ability run a 100-yard dash, the outcome of the race is a highly \nreliable predictor of the next race. You don\u2019t need to know anything about the process because \nthe result alone is proof of the difference in ability.  \n \nThe difficulty with using a returns-based approach to assessing skill is that there is not a great \ndeal of reliability, or persistence, in measures of excess returns. Researchers do find evidence for \nmodest persistence but only when returns are carefully adjusted to account for style factors.11 But \ncorrelations over short periods, say year-to-year, for alpha based on the capital asset pricing \nmodel (CAPM) are quite low.    \n \nThis problem of low reliability applies broadly to any highly competitive field that is probabilistic. \nResults, and especially short-term results, cannot distinguish between a good process and a poor \nprocess because of the role of luck. So going directly to the results gives little indication about the \nquality of the decision-making process and the skill of the participant. \n \nIn contrast, the approach that considers the holdings and characteristics of the manager allows \nus to look at both reliability and validity. Now the discussion shifts a bit. The questions become: \nwhich measures of an active manager\u2019s portfolio reflect skill and therefore reliability? For \nexample, a manager may be able to control the number of holdings, risk, turnover, and fees. \nNext, of the measures that are reliable, which are highly correlated with the ultimate objective of \ndelivering excess returns? Are there measures that are both reliable and valid? \n \nActive Share + Tracking Error = Indicator of Skill \n \nLet\u2019s now take a closer look at active share. In plain language, active share is \u201cthe percentage of \nthe fund\u2019s portfolio that differs from the fund\u2019s benchmark index.\u201d12 Assuming no leverage or \nshorting, active share is 0 percent if the fund perfectly mimics the index and 100 percent if the \nfund is totally different than the index.  \n \nMore technically,  \nActive Share \n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\nN\ni\ni\nindex\ni\nfund\n1\n,\n,\n2\n1\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n \nwhere: \n\u03c9fund,i = portfolio weight of asset i in the fund \n\u03c9index,i = portfolio weight of asset i in the index \n \nHere\u2019s a really simple example. Say the index has 10 stocks, weighted as follows: \n \nIndex Holdings \nPosition \nWeight \nStock 1  \n20.0 % \nStock 2  \n15.0 \nStock 3  \n12.0 \nStock 4  \n11.0 \nStock 5  \n10.0 \n \n \nStock 6    \n  9.0 \n \nStock 7     \n  8.0 \nStock 8    \n  7.0 \nStock 9    \n  5.0  \nStock 10 \n  3.0 \nTotal \n           100.0  \n \n"

For the past 30 \nyears, active share has been declining steadily for the mutual fund universe in the United States. \nFor instance, the percentage of assets under management with active share less than 60 percent \nwent from 1.5 percent in 1980 to over 40 percent today.  \n \nThe selection of an index as a benchmark is obviously crucial. Research by Antti Petajisto shows \nthat of the roughly 2,500 mutual funds he analyzed, 38.6 percent used the S&P 500 as their \nbenchmark. Weighted by assets, 56 percent of the funds use the S&P 500 as a benchmark. \nOther popular benchmarks include the Russell 2000 (8.8 percent by number, 6.2 percent by \nweight), the Russell 1000 Growth (8.4 percent by number, 5.6 percent by weight) and the Russell \n1000 Value (8.2 percent by number, 8.4 percent by weight).

That means either buying stocks that are not represented in the index, or \nowning stocks that are in the index but at a position weight that is higher or lower than what is in \nthe index.   \n \nThe second way to raise active share is through systematic factor risk15, which is effectively \nbetting on factors by overweighting or underweighting16 industries. For example, a manager who \nis bullish on an economic recovery might overweight industries that are economically sensitive, or \na manager who is bearish might overweight defensive industries. Tracking error, the standard \ndeviation of the difference between the returns of the fund and of the index, does an effective job \nin capturing systematic factor risk. Tracking error puts more weight on correlated active bets than \nactive share does. You can think of active share as a complement to tracking error and a \nmeasure that adds value in explaining fund results. A full picture of active management \nincorporates both active share and tracking error.  \n \nTo illustrate the difference between these measures of active management, Petajisto offers the \nfollowing illustration. Say a portfolio has 50 stocks. If all of the overweight positions are in \ntechnology stocks that move together, then small active positions will generate high tracking \nerror. The portfolio has high systematic risk.  \n \nOn the other hand, say the index represents 50 industries with 20 stocks in each industry and the \nfund selects one stock from each industry but weights that stock at the same level as the industry. \nIn this case, active share will be high at about 95 percent but the tracking error will be relatively \nlow. As Petajisto notes, \u201cactive share is a reasonable proxy for stock selection, whereas tracking \nerror is a proxy for systematic factor risk.\u201d  \n \nThere is a clear relationship between active share and tracking error. When active share is low, \ntracking error tends to be low and when active share is high, tracking error tends to be high. But \nthe data show some amount of variation. For example, funds with tracking error of 4-6 percent \ncan have active shares of 30 percent to 100 percent, while active shares in the 70-80 percent \n"

This range of values for \neach measure of active management shows why it is important to distinguish between the two.  \n \nExhibit 2 shows a matrix that classifies 401 mutual funds based on active share and tracking error \nusing data from year-end 2007. The funds were sorted into quintiles based on each measure, \nwith one as the lowest value and five as the highest value. The cells represent the number of \nfunds that fall into the intersection of each pairing of quintiles. For example, if you examine the \ntop right corner, you can see that 47 funds, or 11.6 percent of the sample, are in the highest \nquintile of both active share and tracking error. These are funds that are very different than their \nbenchmarks and that have results that vary quite a bit from their benchmark. In contrast, the \nbottom left corner shows that nearly 15 percent of the sample\u201459 funds\u2014are in the lowest \nquintile of both active share and tracking error. These are index hugging funds. To be in the top \nquintile, a fund must have an active share higher than 91 percent and a tracking error higher than \n5.3 percent. \n \nExhibit 2: 401 Mutual Funds Ranked in Quintiles Based on Active Share and Tracking Error  \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n5\n0\n1\n4\n29\n47\n4\n1\n8\n22\n23\n26\n3\n7\n22\n25\n20\n6\n2\n13\n34\n24\n7\n2\n1\n59\n15\n5\n1\n0\nActive \nShare\nTracking Error\n \nSource: Morningstar, FactSet, and LMCM analysis. \n \nA common measure of portfolio performance is the information ratio, which is excess return \ndivided by tracking error. There is a fairly linear relationship between large factor bets (i.e., the \noverweighting or underweighting of industries relative to the benchmark) and tracking error. So in \norder to have an attractive information ratio, those factor bets have to really pay off to \ncompensate for the high tracking error. Broadly speaking, they don\u2019t. So active managers are \nbetter off maintaining high active share through stock picking than through sector bets.  \n \nThe appendix provides a more sophisticated numerical example of active share and systematic \nfactor bets based on a fictitious index and fund. \n \nActive Share and Fees \n \nThe downward drift in active share raises an important issue in the active versus passive debate. \nIf you\u2019re going to go passive, go passive. Buy a fund that charges low fees and closely mirrors the \nindex. If you\u2019re going to go active, find a manager with a good process and high active share. \nAcademic research shows, for example, that the best ideas of money managers generate excess \nreturns.17 \n \nActive managers who have crept toward closet indexing have created a losing proposition\u2014\nmarket-like returns accompanied by fees higher than index funds. Petajisto provides an \ninteresting case with Fidelity\u2019s flagship mutual fund, Magellan. Peter Lynch made the fund famous \nby delivering outstanding returns in the 1980s when he managed it, in part by sustaining high \nactive share. When Jeffrey Vinik ran the fund in the early 1990s, it had an active share above 70 \npercent. However, the fund\u2019s next manager, Robert Stansky, who took over in 1996, took the \nactive share below 40 percent and kept it there for a half dozen years.   \n \nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to beat the market with low active share and an average expense ratio. \nSay a fund has an expense ratio of 125 basis points\u2014roughly the average of all funds in \nPetajisto\u2019s study\u2014and the active share is 33 percent. That means that two-thirds of the portfolio \n"

Therefore, the active part has to make up for \nthe difference with massive outperformance.

Generating excess returns is \nchallenging enough, but low active share and average fees make the task even more daunting.    \n \nReliability and Validity \n \nWe noted before that the returns-based approach to assessing skill skips the steps of reliability \nand validity. Now we apply the features of a useful statistic to active share and tracking error. The \nway to test reliability in this case is to examine the coefficient of correlation, r, between the active \nshare for the same fund over two different time periods. Using a sample of approximately 400 \nmutual funds, the r between active share for 2007 and 2010 is 86 percent. (See exhibit 3, left \nside.) Cremers and Petajisto also found active share to be reliable. This makes sense, because \nactive share is within the control of a portfolio manager.  \n \nTracking error, too, appears to have good reliability. For the same funds and same time period, \nthe coefficient of correlation, r, is 76 percent. (See exhibit 3, right side.) To put these figures in \ncontext, three-year alphas based on the CAPM have a coefficient of correlation of close to zero.  \n \nExhibit 3: Reliability of Active Share and Tracking Error \n \nSource: Morningstar, FactSet, and LMCM analysis. \n \nThe second feature of a useful statistic is validity\u2014it leads you to the outcomes that you seek. \nThe research suggests that high active share is desirable if it is the result of stock picking, but \nless desirable if it is the result of factor bets that show up as high tracking error. Petajisto sorts \n1,124 funds into five categories based on results from 1990 through 2009 (see exhibit 4).

      "text": " \nPage 9 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nThe conclusion is that a thoughtful combination of active share and tracking error reflects the \nessential features of a good statistic: they are reliable and valid. Still, active share needs additional \ntesting before it can be declared sufficient to indicate ex ante skill. One specific concern is \nbenchmark selection. Small capitalization funds, for instance, tend to have higher active share than \nlarge capitalization funds. This is because small capitalization indexes have more stocks, with a \nlower average weight, than large capitalization indexes do. So the favorable results from the \nanalysis of active share may stem in part from the fact that small capitalization funds beat their \nindexes more often than large capitalization funds do.18   \n \nSummary \n \nInvestment management is a very competitive business, in part because there are so many bright \nand motivated people seeking to beat their benchmarks. As a result, randomness plays a large role \nin determining results in the short term and it is difficult to deliver excess returns over time. Still, \nacademic research shows that some funds do better than chance would suggest, and that active \nmanagers beat their benchmarks before fees. The fundamental question is whether funds with a \ngood chance of outperforming their benchmark can be identified in advance.  \n \nThere are two approaches to assessing managers. The first examines past results. This approach \ncan reveal information if the track record is sufficiently long and enough controls are put into place \nso as to ensure that the results are not the consequence of risk. But relying on results in any domain \nthat is based on probability is inherently troublesome, because the challenge of sorting skill and \nrandomness is daunting.  \n \nThe second approach studies the characteristics and behavior of the manager in order to assess \nwhether he or she has a good process. To be useful, any measure of performance must have two \nfeatures: reliability and validity. Most manager assessments use statistics that are neither reliable \nnor valid. We argue that a combination of active share and tracking error provides a glimpse into \nprocess. Taken together, these statistics are also reliable and valid. Based on this discussion, we \ncan arrive at four conclusions: \n \n\u2022 \nThere is a role for active management. Having some active managers is a logical necessity. \nResearch shows that active management increases the informational efficiency of stock \nprices and that passive management makes prices less efficient. The key challenge is \nidentifying above-average managers ahead of time. \n\u2022 \nReliability and validity. Most statistics in the investment industry fail the dual test of reliability \nand validity. This is true in corporate America as well. As a consequence, it\u2019s important to \nbreak down investment results further in order to get a better handle on potential skill. \n\u2022 \nThe combination of active share and tracking error provides insight. Active share and \ntracking error are both reliable statistics. For example, for 400 mutual funds (2007 to 2010) \nthe coefficient of correlation for active share was 86 percent while tracking error was 76 \npercent. In seeking validity, the goal is to identify funds with high active share (top quintile) \nthat are not in the highest quintile for tracking error. High tracking error indicates sizeable \nfactor bets, which tend to deliver poor returns. Research by Cremers and Petajisto, \nconfirmed by our own smaller sample, shows that funds with high active share and \nmoderate tracking error deliver excess returns. \n\u2022 \nThere is a long-term trend toward lower active share. The percentage of assets under \nmanagement with active share below 60 percent\u2014considered to be closet indexing\u2014has \nrisen from 1.5 percent 30 years ago to more than 40 percent today. Passive management \nmakes sense for a great deal of investors. But the essential message is this: If you\u2019re going \nto be active, go active. Don\u2019t own a fund with low active share, because the chances are \ngood that the fund\u2019s gross returns will be insufficient to leave you with attractive returns after \nfees. \n  \nI\u2019d like to acknowledge the intellectual contribution of Arturo Rodriguez, CFA. As always, Dan Callahan, CFA, \nadded great value in all aspects of preparing this piece. \n"
