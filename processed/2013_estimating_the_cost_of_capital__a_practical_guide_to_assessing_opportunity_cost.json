An investment opportunity has to have a positive after-tax expected return so that you will end up \nwith more money, after inflation, tomorrow than you have today.1 Of course, there is no guarantee that the \nvalue of your investment will grow over time, but without that expectation there would be no reason to invest in \nthe first place.  \n \nThe value of a financial asset is the present value of future cash flows. In order to value a financial asset, you \nmust have a sense of the magnitude and timing of cash flows, as well as the risk associated with receiving the \ncash. For instance, a company that issues a standard bond makes a legal commitment to pay interest on a \ntimely basis and to repay the principal. Investors are left to determine the risk that the company won\u2019t be able \nto fulfill its obligations. As the risk increases that a company will default, the expected return that investors \ndemand increases as well. A higher expectation of a loss requires a higher expectation of a reward.  \n \nThe determinants of value are explicit in the bond market. The terms of the bond issuance specify the \nmagnitude and timing of cash flows, and the yield on the bond is an expression of the expected return. Even if \nan investor disagrees with the market\u2019s assessment of a bond price, there is no question that the \ndeterminants of value are in plain view. \n \nNone of the determinants of value are explicit in the stock market. Dividends are at best a quasi-commitment \nto return cash to shareholders, and there is no direct way to see a stock\u2019s expected return. So equity investors \nneed to understand the expectations for future cash flows and the risk that a stock price embeds. This makes \nvaluation inherently trickier for equity than debt. \n \nThe cost of capital is the rate at which you need to discount future cash flows in order to determine the value \ntoday. Investors determine that rate based on their opportunity cost. Estimating the cost of debt is relatively \nstraightforward, but estimating the cost of equity is much more challenging. This report is a practical guide for \nestimating the weighted average cost of capital, with the goal of deriving a figure that is sensible from a \nbusiness and economic standpoint.    \n \nEstimates for the cost of equity generally rely on an asset pricing model. The most popular is the capital asset \npricing model (CAPM), which has come under considerable fire in recent years. Beta, a measure of a \nsecurity\u2019s financial elasticity versus the market, is the specific variable in the model that researchers and \npractitioners question.  \n \nWe are neither strict nor enthusiastic defenders of the faith in this model. But we do believe that it can have \npractical utility if you take steps to reduce the error in beta and complement the input with market-priced \nmarkers such as bond yields, implied volatility in option prices, and credit default swap prices. These markers \ncan provide guidance and context for establishing a reasonable cost of capital.  \n \nSome investors claim that the concerns surrounding the CAPM are sufficient to abandon the practice of \ndiscounting cash flows altogether. A further complaint is that modest changes in assumptions for cash flows \nor the cost of capital can have a meaningful impact on value. These investors often value companies using \nmultiples, including price/earnings, enterprise value/EBITDA, and price/book.  \n \nHere\u2019s the key: Multiples are not valuation. Multiples are a proxy for the valuation process. No one should blur \nthat distinction. Growth and return on investment, along with the discount rate, are what determine the \nappropriate multiple. Investors who rely on multiples are not avoiding the problem of forecasting cash flows \n"

In other words, a \nrisk-averse investor will buy the asset with the highest return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a \ngiven level of return. Central to this idea is that the higher the risk, the higher the required return.  \n \nImportant, too, is the idea that the risk of a particular security refers to its contribution to the risk (i.e., variance \nof the return) of a diversified portfolio. As a consequence, it is possible for a particular stock to have high \nindividual risk, but low risk relative to the market. The proper focus is not on the risk of the individual security, \nbut rather how that security affects the risk of the overall portfolio.  \n \nIn order to create shareholder value, a company must be able to find projects that generate returns that \nexceed the cost of capital. Exhibit 1 shows the link between companies and capital markets. Just as investors \nmust carefully consider the trade-off between risk and reward, companies must evaluate their prospective \ninvestments, including capital expenditures and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), to judge whether they will \ndeliver appropriate returns.  \n \nExhibit 1: The Link between Companies and Capital Markets \n \nSource: G. Bennett Stewart, III, The Quest for Value: A Guide for Senior Managers (New York: HarperCollins, 1991), 83.  \n \nA company\u2019s balance sheet is composed of assets on the left and liabilities and equity on the right. Assets are \nthe resources the company employs to generate cash flows. Liabilities and equity are the ways the company \nfinances those resources. Debt and equity are the most popular forms of financial capital.  \n \nDebt is a contractual obligation between a company and its lenders, in which the company pledges to make \ntimely payments of interest and to return principal at the end of the contractually-specified period. Debt \ngenerally has a claim to assets that is senior to that of equity. \n \nEquity is technically a contract between a company and its shareholders that confers limited rights to \nshareholders. From a practical standpoint, equity represents a claim on future residual cash flows. Equity \nholders only have a claim to cash flows that exist after the company has paid all other stakeholders, including \ncreditors (interest and principal), suppliers (accounts payable), the government (taxes), and employees \n(wages).2 \nProspective Investments\nWACC\nReward\nReturn\nRisk\nRf\nCorporate\nInvestor\n"

As a result, the \nhighest profit scenario ($120) is 50 percent above the lowest ($80). \n \nCompany Charlie \n \n \n        \n \nOperating profit      Interest expense \n        Pretax profit \nBullish scenario  \n \n \n$120  \n \n \n    $30 \n \n \n \n \n    $90 \nBase case scenario \n    100  \n \n    \n 30 \n \n \n    \n      70 \nBearish scenario \n      \n  80   \n \n    \n 30 \n \n \n    \n      50 \n \nCharlie has debt and hence interest expense. The variability of pretax profits for Charlie is much higher than \nthat for Bravo. The highest profit ($90) is 80 percent higher than the lowest profit ($50). So the addition of \ndebt creates more volatility in profits, which may suggest different values for Bravo and Charlie.   \n \n\u201cWait!\u201d you may say, \u201cI learned something about the Modigliani and Miller (M&M) invariance proposition\u2014that \nthe value of a firm is independent of its capital structure.\u201d4 M&M\u2019s main point is that a change in the capital \nstructure doesn\u2019t change risk overall. It simply transfers risk from one constituent to another. As a company \nadds financial leverage, risk for the remaining equity rises because the size of the senior claim on assets, debt, \nincreases. The cost of debt also goes up because the size of the contractual obligation grows. But since debt \nis less costly than equity due to its seniority in the capital structure, overall risk is preserved.  \n \nHere\u2019s an example. Assume a firm has $100 in annual operating profit.

The firm\u2019s value is simply \n$100 divided by 10 percent, or $1,000. In scenario B, the company issues $200 of debt at a cost of 5 \npercent. Now, the cash flow left over for equity holders drops from $100 to $90 (interest expense of $10 = \n$200 * 5 percent), increasing its risk. To compensate, shareholders now demand a return of 11.25 percent. \nBut note that the firm is still worth $1,000 ($200 debt + $800 equity).  \n \nIn scenario C, the company takes on even more debt, pushing the total to $400. Since there\u2019s more debt, the \nrisk for debt holders rises from 5 to 6.25 percent. The greater interest payments ($25 = 6.25 percent * $400) \nmean that there\u2019s only $75 left over for equity holders. The risk for equity holders has risen, too, reaching \n12.5 percent. So the cost of debt and the cost of equity are both higher, but the value of the firm stays the \nsame at $1,000 ($400 debt + $600 equity).   \n \nM&M\u2019s invariance proposition is true under certain conditions, including no taxes, no bankruptcy costs, no \neffects on managerial incentives, and markets being perfect and complete. The most important assumption is \na world without taxes. Since interest expense is tax deductible, increasing debt adds value because \nstakeholders are getting value at the expense of the government. The key takeaway from M&M is that when \nyou introduce conditions from the real world, capital structure does matter.5 The changes in the cost of capital \nare not the result of how you slice and dice the capital structure (scenarios A, B, and C), but rather are based \non the role of taxes and other factors.     \n \nCompanies with low business risk as the result of predictable cash flows are in the best position to take on \ndebt. Companies with high business risk are more likely to shun leverage. In fact, many young companies hold \nnet cash balances which create negative financial risk and actually serve to dampen the effect of business \nrisk.6 \n \n \n"

      "text": "October 8, 2013  \n \nEstimating the Cost of Capital \n8 \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n \nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) blends the opportunity cost of the sources of capital \nwith the relative contribution of those sources.  \n \nFor example, take a company with an after-tax cost of debt of 5 percent and a cost of equity of 10 percent \nthat is financed with 30 percent debt and 70 percent equity. The weighted average cost of capital would be \n8.5 percent, calculated as follows:  \n \nWACC   \n \n= (cost of debt * weighting of debt) + (cost of equity * weighting of equity)  \n \n= (5% * 30%) + (10% * 70%) \n \n= 1.5% + 7.0% \n \n= 8.5% \n \nThe weighted average cost of capital is the appropriate rate to discount the future free cash flows attributable \nto the firm in order to determine their present value. When discounting cash flows attributable to equity \nholders\u2014common for financial services firms\u2014the correct discount rate is the cost of equity capital. \n \nThere are a few issues to keep in mind when estimating WACC. The first is that you should base the relative \nweighting of debt and equity on market value, not book value.7 The logic behind this is straightforward: The \nopportunity cost an investor demands is based on the prevailing asset price, not the level at which the \ncompany recorded the debt or equity on the balance sheet.  \n \nCompanies often share targets for debt-to-total capital ratios that are based on book value. In this case, you \nmust translate that target into a ratio based on market value. \n \nSecond, the WACC is not the appropriate discount rate for all of the investments a company makes. If the \ncompany invests in a business or makes an acquisition that has greater or lesser risk than the company does, \nthen the discount rate the company applies to that investment should be higher or lower than the WACC to \nreflect that difference.  \n \nThird, don\u2019t adjust your WACC based on varying risk assessments. The discount rate should be consistent. \nYou can reflect risk by considering different scenarios for cash flows\u2014some good, some bad. A careful \nexamination of those cash-flow scenarios, including making sure you have considered all possible outcomes, \nis the essential way to capture and grasp risk.  \n \nFinally, you should use the adjusted present value (APV) method if you expect a company to have a dynamic \ncapital structure.8 This method is relevant, for example, for a company that levers up and then expects to \nrapidly pay down debt. A section of the appendix discusses this approach. In short, APV values the company \nassuming it is all equity financed, values the tax shield, and then adds the two together to come up with \ncorporate value. It is based on the principle of additivity: You can value the pieces of the company and add \nthem together to understand the whole. \n \n \n \n \n"

      "text": "October 8, 2013  \n \nEstimating the Cost of Capital \n9 \nCalculating the Cost of Debt \n \nThe cost of debt is the after-tax rate a company would have to pay today on its long-term debt. \n \nThe yield-to-maturity on the company\u2019s long-term, option-free bonds is a good estimate for the cost of debt.  \n \nIf the company only has short-term debt or debt that doesn\u2019t trade much (i.e., is illiquid), you can estimate the \ncost of debt indirectly in two steps. First, determine the credit rating on the company\u2019s unsecured long-term \ndebt. Second, look at the average yield-to-maturity on a portfolio of bonds with a similar credit rating. Bond \ninvestors often express this as a spread over a Treasury rate, usually the 10-year note. The treasury yield is a \nproxy for the risk-free rate. If you are dealing with a fixed income security that includes any options, you \nshould use an option-adjusted spread (OAS).  \n \nSome companies finance themselves mostly, or completely, with short-term debt. In this case, should you use \nthe short-term rates as the cost of debt? The answer is no. Short-term rates do not reflect expectations about \nlong-term inflation. The time horizon for estimating the cost of capital should be consistent with the time \nhorizon of the cash flow forecast period. The long-term rate is a better approximation of interest costs over \ntime even for companies that roll over their short-term debt because long-term rates capture the expected \ncost of repeated borrowing. If a company exclusively relies on short-term debt, use its credit rating to \napproximate the cost of long-term debt.  \n \nThe calculation of free cash flow (more formally net operating profit after tax less investment needs) assumes \nthat the company is financed solely with equity. This creates valuable comparability. But since interest expense \nis tax deductible, debt creates a valuable tax shield that free cash flow does not reflect.  \n \nTo capture the value of the tax shield, you must adjust debt from a pretax rate to an after-tax rate. To do this, \nmultiply the pre-tax cost of debt by one minus the marginal tax rate. In most cases, you can assume that the \neffective and marginal tax rates are equivalent. The formula is: \n \nAfter-tax cost of debt = pretax cost of debt * (1 \u2013 marginal tax rate) \n \nFor investment-grade companies, you can assume that the effective tax rate approximates the statutory rate. \nBut for companies with tax loss carryforwards, tax loss carrybacks, or investment tax credits, the effective rate \nmay be materially different. In your calculation of the cost of debt, you should use the statutory rate (including \nstate and local taxes) for countries where the company earns its operating profit. For a company with a large \npresence outside its country of domicile, this can lead to a meaningful difference between the tax rate in a \ncompany\u2019s home country and the tax rate it actually must pay.9  \n \nSome companies have substantial tax loss carryforwards and are not expected to have to pay taxes for the \nforeseeable future. In this case it makes sense to value the company in two stages. First, assume the \ncompany pays normal taxes in its free cash flows. This, of course, will lead to a value that is too low. Second, \ncalculate the present value of the tax savings. To do this, calculate the annual tax savings and discount that \nsavings at the cost of debt. (Note that the company has to produce operating income to realize tax savings.) \nAdd that amount back to the value of the firm assuming full tax payment. These two stages allow for \ncomparability to profitable peers and specify the value of the tax savings.  \n \nIn many cases, the book value of debt is a reasonable proxy for the market value of debt. But take note if the \ndebt is trading at a substantial premium or discount to par, and make the adjustment in your debt-to-total \ncapital ratio if necessary.  \n"

      "text": "October 8, 2013  \n \nEstimating the Cost of Capital \n10 \nCalculating the Cost of Equity \n \nThe cost of equity is the expected total return on a company\u2019s stock.  \n \nIt stands to reason that the cost of equity is higher than the cost of debt. To begin, equity is a junior claim on \nthe value of the firm versus debt. So if something goes wrong, debt holders get paid first and equity holders \nget whatever is left over. Further, interest expense on debt is tax deductible, making debt an even cheaper \nsource of financing. Your estimate of the cost of equity should never be below the cost of debt.  \n \nUnlike the cost of debt, which is often observable, the cost of equity is unobservable. As a result, we need to \nrely on an asset pricing model to estimate it. The three best known models are the capital asset pricing model \n(CAPM), the Fama-French Three-Factor model, and arbitrage pricing theory (APT). Because the CAPM is the \nmost common model, we\u2019ll use it as our primary method. The appendix describes the other models. \n \nThe CAPM says that the expected return on a security is the risk-free rate plus the security\u2019s beta times the \nequity risk premium (i.e., the difference between the market return and the risk-free rate): \n \nExpected return = Risk-free rate + \u03b2(Market return \u2013 risk-free rate) \n \nIn the CAPM, the equity risk premium is the same for all companies. Only the beta is different from company \nto company. See Exhibit 2.  \n \nExhibit 2: The Security Market Line \n \nSource: Credit Suisse.  \n \nThe CAPM is better as pure theory than in practice, so putting it to work requires a number of important \njudgments.

The best proxy for it is the yield on a long-term, default-free government fixed \nincome security. In the United States, the 10-year Treasury note is a suitable security. This yield is easy to \nfind, is sufficiently long-dated, and has a relatively low risk of default. Outside of the United States, you can \nadjust the local-currency government borrowing rate by the estimated default spread.

The second is to survey investors about their expectations. \nThe third is to estimate a market-implied rate by reverse engineering the market price.  \n \nEach approach has strengths and weaknesses. Historical results are backed by lots of data but are highly \nsensitive to the time period you select to analyze, reflect survivorship bias, and vary based on whether you use \narithmetic or geometric averages. Surveys capture investor attitudes at the moment but are imperfect because \ninvestors have a strong tendency to extrapolate their most recent experience, and the structures of the \nsurveys are not always ideal. A market-implied ERP is based on prevailing prices but requires numerous \nassumptions about drivers such as future growth and return on capital.  \n \nStill, not all is lost. You can come at the problem of estimating the ERP from a number of different angles and \ngenerally arrive at a figure that is economically sound. One approach that makes sense is to start with a \nhistorical average, calibrate the result using credit spreads, and then compare it to market-implied returns. \n \nWhen calculating the historical ERP, you must answer a few questions: \n \uf402\n What is the appropriate risk-free rate?  \n \uf402\n Over what time period should you look at returns?  \n \uf402\n Which average should you use, arithmetic or geometric?  \n \nYour answers to these questions can have a large influence on your estimate of the ERP. A recent paper by \nAswath Damodaran showed an ERP range of 1.7 to 7.7 percent based on which combination of these \nchoices were made.12 \n \nWe have effectively answered the question about the risk-free rate. For the reasons we cited, the return on \nthe 10-year Treasury note works well. If you choose to use Treasury bills or bonds, you must make sure that \nthe ERP is adjusted accordingly.    \n \nThe time horizon issue is trickier. Some believe that shorter time horizons are preferable because they better \nreflect current conditions. The problem with that argument is that short time periods come with huge standard \nerrors. The standard deviation of S&P 500 returns since 1928 has been very close to 20 percent.  \n \nStandard error  \n=  standard deviation \n \n \n \n \n \n    the square root of the measured time \n \n \n    \n\u221a    \n \n \nSo, for example, the standard error of an ERP based on 5 years of data is 8.9 percent. Even 25 years of data \nhas a standard error of 4 percent. So for time periods less than 20 years, the standard errors are likely to be \nas large, or larger, than the ERP itself. This argues for using a longer time period. We have reliable data for \nthe past 80 years, which gets the standard error down to about 2.2 percent. \n \nInvestors who use historical averages to estimate the ERP rarely specify whether they are using arithmetic or \ngeometric returns. The difference between the two is material. For equity less bond returns from 1928-2012, \n"

The difference, 1.7 \npercentage points, is a large percentage of the value of either total. \n \nThe arithmetic average is the simple mean of the series of annual ERPs (equity market - risk-free rate). The \ngeometric mean is the compounded return. The geometric return is always less than or equal to the arithmetic \nreturn. The difference is greater as the standard deviation of the time series increases. \n \nIf your goal is to estimate the market\u2019s risk premium over the next year, then the arithmetic average is the way \nto go. For multiple time periods, in contrast, a geometric average is better.   \n \nThe second approach is to look at credit spreads, which reflect a bond risk premium. Because fixed income \nreturns are observable, we can use them as a benchmark to estimate unobservable equity returns. The initial, \nstraightforward point is that the ERP should not be below the credit spread for the simple reason that you \nshould not expect to earn a higher return on an asset with less risk. Further, widening or narrowing credit \nspreads can be a useful indicator of a widening or narrowing ERP.  \n \nThe final approach is an estimate of the market-implied ERP. The idea is that the key drivers of value, \nincluding earnings and dividends, follow long-term trends that are reasonably predictable. With a sense of \nfuture cash flows and knowledge of the prevailing price, we can solve for the discount rate that equates the \npresent value of future free cash flows to today\u2019s price.  \n \nDamodaran posts this calculation on his website each month: http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/.  \n \nExhibit 4 shows Damodaran\u2019s estimate of the ERP since September 2008. The ERP has been in a wide band \nof four to eight percent in the past five years. The line in the chart is the price of the S&P 500. Note that the \nERP and S&P 500 tend to go in opposite directions. This means lower stock prices generally suggest higher \nexpected returns and vice versa. As of October 1, 2013, Damodaran\u2019s estimate for the ERP was 5.7 percent, \nwhile the model developed by Credit Suisse\u2019s equity strategy group implied a warranted ERP of 4.5 percent.13 \n \nExhibit 4: Implied Equity Risk Premium per Aswath Damodaran \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran and Credit Suisse.  \nNote: 2013 data as of 09/30/13; ERP is average of prior 12 months. \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n1,800\n3%\n4%\n5%\n6%\n7%\n8%\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\nS&P 500 Index Price\nEquity Risk Premium (ERP)\nERP\nS&P 500\n"

The sum of the note yield and ERP is the expected return for the market. After peaking in the \nearly 1980s, the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s drove down the implied return for the stock market.  \n \nThe exhibit shows something even more remarkable: The ratio between the equity risk premium and the risk-\nfree rate. That ratio has averaged 0.8 over the past five decades (roughly an average ERP of 4 percent and \nrisk-free rate of 5 percent). But following the extraordinarily loose monetary policy adopted by central banks \naround the world following the financial crisis, interest rates have been pushed below the level that many \nconsider normal.

Saying it differently, the market-capitalization weighted average beta of all \ninvestments must average one. \n \nSo what exactly is beta? Beta is a measure of the excess return on an individual security relative to the excess \nreturn on the market index. You can think of it as a measure of financial elasticity. In practice, you calculate a \nhistorical beta by doing a regression analysis with the market\u2019s total returns as the independent variable (x-\naxis) and the asset\u2019s total returns as the dependent variable (y-axis).15 The slope of the best-fit line is beta. \nExhibit 6 shows the beta for Netflix (NFLX) based on monthly returns over the 60 months ended September \n2013.   \n \nExhibit 6: Beta Is the Slope of the Best-Fit Line \n \nSource: FactSet and Credit Suisse.  \n \nAs you may recall from a math class long ago, you can describe the slope of a line as the rise over the run. If \nan asset went up and down in exactly the same way as the market, the line would be at a 45 degree angle \nand the rise over run would equal 1.0. If the asset goes up or down at a percentage twice that of the market, \nthe rise over run would equal 2.0, and you would consider that asset to be riskier than the market. Naturally, if \nthe asset rises or falls at a rate that is one-half of the market\u2019s percentage, it would have a beta of 0.5 and \nyou would deem it to be less risky than the market. (More technically, you are supposed to calculate beta \nusing excess returns. But calculating beta using total returns makes little practical difference.) The definition of \nbeta, then, is the covariance between the security and the market (rise) divided by the variance of the market \n(run).   \n \nAs an additional note, the y-intercept of the best-fit line is the alpha. It is a measure of excess return relative \nto risk as measured by beta. In the aggregate, alpha must average to zero.  \n \nExhibit 7 shows the calculation for beta and alpha for Disney for the 60 months ended September 2013.

The challenge to the adjustment is with respect to the weightings. It is \nlikely that betas converge to 1.0 at different rates for different companies, and the one-size-fits all solution \nfails to capture that. Still, this adjustment likely improves the estimate of a forward-looking beta. \n \nIndustry Beta \n \nThe second way to improve beta is to consider an industry beta instead of betas for individual companies. In \nour discussion of high-level thoughts, we discussed breaking down corporate risk into business risk and \nfinancial risk. The key premise supporting an industry beta is that business risk, or operating risk, will be \nsimilar from company to company within an industry. By considering a larger sample, an industry beta can help \nwring out the errors that plague the estimates for individual companies.  \n \nThere is a three-step process to calculate an industry beta: \n \uf402\n Unlever the beta. Because an individual company\u2019s beta combines both business risk and financial risk, \nwe first need to remove the effect of financial leverage by unlevering the beta. The equation to do this, \nwhich is based on M&M\u2019s invariance proposition, is as follows: \n \n\u03b2U =      \n \n \u03b2L          _ \n \n[1 + (1 \u2013 T)(D/E)] \n \nWhere:  \n \n\u03b2U = Beta unlevered \n\u03b2L = Beta levered \nT = Tax rate \nD = Market value of debt (% of total capital) \nE = Market value of equity (% of total capital) \n \nTake for example Company Echo with a raw beta of 1.2, a 35 percent tax rate, 20 percent debt, and 80 \npercent equity:  \n \n\u03b2U =      \n \n 1.2             _ \n \n1 + (1 \u2013 .35)(.20/.80) \n \n\u03b2U =      \n \n 1.2             _ \n \n     1 + (.65)(.25) \n \n\u03b2U =      \n \n 1.2             _ \n \n         1.1625 \n \n\u03b2U  = 1.03 \n \uf402\n Calculate the average beta for the industry. The second step is to create an average of all the \nunlevered betas for the companies within the industry. You can define an industry as a set of companies \nthat have similar business risk. You then take the market-capitalization-weighted average of the industry. \nIt\u2019s often useful to also look at the median to see if it\u2019s in the same range as the mean. \n \n"

But there are other means to finance assets as well. \nOne example is operating leases. For instance, a retailer can choose to either buy or lease a new store. Given \nthe transparency of interest rates and taxes, these two financing sources are generally nearly equivalent. But \ntheir effects on the income statement and balance sheet are very different. We want to normalize the two \nmethods for the purpose of comparing companies and estimating the cost of capital. You will find this most \nrelevant for industries with heavy investment needs, including transportation (e.g., airlines) and retail. \n \nOperating leases. Companies that choose to acquire stores through operating leases have lower operating \nincome and lower levels of debt than companies that choose to buy their stores. In order to make the two \nchoices comparable, for companies that lease you need to add the implied principal amount of the lease to \nassets and the equivalent amount of debt to the right side of the balance sheet. This increases the ratio of \ndebt to total capital. For companies that lease you also need to adjust earnings before interest and \namortization by reclassifying the implied interest expense portion of the lease payments from an operating \nexpense to a financing cost.  \n \nAs a consequence of these adjustments, corporate value increases as you are discounting a higher cash flow \nnumber by a lower discount rate. But the equity value is theoretically unchanged as the increase in corporate \nvalue is offset by a higher level of debt. For more on operating lease adjustments, Aswath Damodaran has a \nspreadsheet that guides your calculations.18  \n \nPreferred stock. Preferred stock is an equity instrument that blends the features of debt and equity. The \ntotal value of preferred stock outstanding in the U.S. is around $165 billion, a small fraction of the equity and \nbond markets. Like debt, preferred stock typically provides its holder a stream of cash flows\u2014in this case, in \nthe form of a dividend. Also like debt, preferred stock generally has no voting rights. However, preferred stock \nresembles equity in that the company is not contractually obligated to pay a dividend (interest payments and \nthe repayment of principal are contracts), and decisions about the dividend are left to the discretion of the \nboard of directors. Because preferred stock is junior to debt but senior to common equity in the capital \nstructure, the cost of preferred stock is typically somewhere in between the two. \n \nCost of preferred = preferred dividend per share/market price per share   \n \nFurther, unlike interest payments on debt, the dividends on preferred stock are not tax deductible. This deters \na lot of companies from issuing preferred stock, with the largest issuers being financial institutions, REITs, and \npublic utilities. Preferred stock is attractive to other companies because tax laws allow companies to exclude \n70 percent of dividend income from their taxable income, which is especially valuable here because preferred \nstock tends to have a higher yield than common stock. Financial companies may use preferred stock to \nimprove capital ratios at a lower cost than straight equity. \n \nMany preferred issues include some provision for retirement, and frequently the preferred offers an option to \nretire the issue, to convert it into common stock, or to repurchase it at a specific time and price. You must \nread the details about a preferred issue to understand if there\u2019s an embedded option. If so, you must include \nthat option in your valuation. \n \n"

The bond yield spread is the yield on a bond in excess of the risk-free rate, and the CDS spread is \nthe cost of insuring against default. When viewed together, the VIX, credit spreads, and CDS spreads give a \nreasonable sense of collective risk aversion. Low volatility and low credit and default risk spreads imply a \ngreater risk appetite, and high readings indicate fear of risky assets.  \n \nCredit Suisse\u2019s Global Risk Appetite Index (CS GRAI) is a useful tool for tracking fluctuations in risk \npreference.20 The CS GRAI gauges risk tolerance by comparing the performance of safe assets such as \ngovernment bonds to more volatile assets such as equities. Typically, the risk appetite is high following a \nperiod when risky assets have generated very high returns and the risk appetite is low following a period of low \nreturns for risky assets.   \n \nLow risk aversion often comes with high asset prices, but high asset prices imply less upside and more \ndownside. And so asset prices are often vulnerable to decline when investors perceive risk to be low\u2014think of \nthe spring of 2000 and the summer of 2007. Conversely, when investors perceive risk to be high, asset \nprices are often very attractive\u2014think spring of 2009.     \n \nWhen collective perceived risk is well above or below historical standards, analysts face a challenge. On the \none hand, the cost of capital represents the opportunity cost of investors, so the prevailing rates and risk levels \nshould be useful and indicative. On the other hand, we know that credit spreads and the equity risk premium \nare series that revert to the mean, which implies that extremely high or low readings are likely to be followed \nby readings closer to the historical average.  \n \nSo should an analyst simply go with the current levels or should he or she normalize the cost of capital \nestimate to reflect long-run averages?  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\nPrice\nAverage\n"

      "text": "October 8, 2013  \n \nEstimating the Cost of Capital \n24 \nThe best approach, if not altogether satisfying, is to calculate the cost of capital twice: once for prevailing \nconditions and a second time for \u201cnormal\u201d conditions. The two calculations should be explicit in your \ncommentary and analysis. When perceived risk is high, the calculation using normal rates will boost your \nvalues. When risk perception is low, normal rates will lower your values. \n \nHarley Davidson\u2019s issuance of senior unsecured notes in February 2009 is a good case for when to use this \ntwo-step approach. The $600 million offering, which carried a 15 percent yield, was snapped up by Berkshire \nHathaway and Davis Selected Advisors. With the company issuing senior unsecured debt at a 15 percent yield, \none could only conclude that the cost of equity was quite a bit higher, probably in the high teens. So it made \nsense to use the market-determined rates to discount future cash flows, even if those rates were exorbitantly \nhigh by historical standards. \n \nAt the same time, it would have been reasonable to assume that collective risk aversion would not remain \nelevated and that more normal rates would prevail at some point in the future. So a separate calculation of \nHarley Davidson\u2019s value, using a discount rate representative of long-term averages, would have been \nappropriate. Again, the key is making sure that you label your analysis clearly.     \n \nAn assumption of finance theory that doesn\u2019t always hold in the real world is that capital is always available, if \nat a price. In reality, there are times when external financing is either exorbitantly expensive or simply \nunavailable. For companies with negative free cash flow (i.e., companies that invest more than they earn) or \nknowledge-based companies that rely on steady investments, windows of capital inaccessibility can be \ncrippling and, in some cases, a mortal blow. Some researchers have argued that future investments are \ntantamount to liabilities and that executives must take those liabilities into consideration in setting the capital \nstructure. \n \nExhibit 13: Determining the Optimal Capital Structure \n \nSource: Credit Suisse based on Tim Koller, Marc Goedhart, and David Wessels, Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, 5th \nEdition (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2010). \n \nPV (costs of \nfinancial distress)\nPV (tax shield)\nValue if all-\nequity financed\nOptimal \ndebt ratio\nDebt ratio\nMarket \nvalue\n"

      "text": "October 8, 2013  \n \nEstimating the Cost of Capital \n25 \nHere\u2019s one way to think about it. In standard finance theory, a company should take on as much debt as it \ncan without incurring too much risk of distress. So a company\u2019s optimal capital structure assumes as much \ndebt as possible to reduce the cost of capital without taking on so much debt as to incur the risk of distress. \nExhibit 13 shows this tradeoff.21  \n \nIn contrast, companies that need to fund future investments need some assurance that they will be able to \ninvest irrespective of the conditions in capital markets. In effect, the insurance value of cash on the balance \nsheet exceeds the value of the tax shield of debt. So these companies tend to have greater cash reserves. \n \nWhen modeling, consider carefully future investment requirements and the company\u2019s need to access external \ncapital. If the company is insufficiently capitalized, make sure that you have a distinct node to reflect the risk of \ndistress. This not an issue about the cost of capital but rather a modeling consideration.  \n"

Fama-French Three-Factor Model \n \nThe Fama-French model estimates returns by considering a correlation with three factors, \nincluding the equity risk premium, the excess returns of small stocks versus large stocks, and the \nexcess returns of cheap stocks versus expensive stocks.  \n \nIn 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French published a bombshell paper that suggested that their tests did \nnot support the CAPM.22 Rather than settling for that criticism, they looked at past returns and tried to \ndetermine what explains returns. Their analysis led them to two variables beyond the market risk premium: \nsmall capitalization and low valuation. They found that small capitalization companies deliver higher returns \nthan large capitalization companies (small minus big, or SMB) and that cheap, high book-to-price stocks \ndeliver higher returns than expensive, low book-to-price stocks (high minus low, or HML).  \n \nReturn = \u03b1 + \u03b21(Rm \u2013 rf) + \u03b22(RS- RB) + \u03b23(RH- RL) + \u03b5 \n \nFama and French imposed a rational asset-pricing framework in the tests of their model. They assumed that \nobserved returns are associated with risk and hence are proxies for risk. In other words, they conclude that \nsmall stocks must be riskier than large stocks and that cheap stocks are riskier than expensive stocks even \nthough there is no clear case for either conclusion based on first principles. \n \nIn Exhibit 14, we calculate the cost of equity for Disney using the Fama-French model. We use monthly \nreturns versus the S&P 500 over the past five years for the CAPM beta and the U.S. 10-year note for the \nrisk-free rate. \n \nExhibit 14: Fama-French Cost of Equity Calculation for Disney \n \nSource: Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, Aswath Damodaran, Dimensional Fund Advisors, Credit Suisse. \nNote: Risk-free rate, ERP, and data used in regression as of 8/30/13. \n \nA couple of issues are worth mentioning here. First, the CAPM beta (the regression versus the market) is the \nmost significant factor determining the premium to the risk-free rate. Second, the key is not whether a stock \nitself is small or cheap but rather how it behaves relative to small and cheap stocks. You should not assume \nautomatically that small and cheap stocks have a risk premium above and beyond the market risk premium.   \n \nThat this multi-factor model outperforms the CAPM should not come as a surprise because Fama and French \nselected risk proxies precisely because they better explained returns. Taken to its logical extension, any factor \ncan be considered a risk factor if it better predicts returns. The challenge is to find risk factors that are causal \nand not simply correlated. \n \nThe main practical impediments to using the Fama-French Three-Factor model are the same as for the basic \nCAPM: choice of time horizon and frequency of measurement period.

      "text": "October 8, 2013  \n \nEstimating the Cost of Capital \n35 \ne. Calculation of Credit Suisse HOLT Discount Rate \n \nThe CFROI\u00ae discount rate is a real, market-implied cost of capital consistent with the CFROI \u201cTotal \nValuation System\u201d approach.  \n \nThe model calculates the discount rate directly from, and in accordance with, the rest of the CFROI valuation \nframework. The discount rate depends on the CFROI fade rate and normalized growth rate assumptions in the \nNet Cash Receipt (NCR) forecasts that drive valuation. It is the cost of capital that equates the NCR forecasts \nwith the current market price. This methodology allows users to compare discount rates to CFROIs in order to \nassess whether management teams are creating or destroying wealth. The CFROI valuation model permits \nCFROI and discount rate comparisons throughout time and across countries.23  \n \nCFROI and discount rate comparison across markets and throughout time is achieved through: 1.) Real \n(inflation-adjusted) NCR\u2019s that eliminates the distortion of changes and differences of purchasing power \naround the world and 2.) The Global Standard Firm (GSF) is used as a point of reference to measure \ncompany-specific risk characteristics and allow for global comparisons. The GSF (also referred to as the \nmarket discount rate or base rate) is a hypothetical company in 1999 of USD $5 billion market cap and 25 \npercent leverage. It is scaled in time to the movement of the MSCI World Index to prevent size bias and is \ncurrency converted for every country at each point in time. The GSF, described as the \u201ccountry rate\u201d in HOLT \nLens, is the focal point from which company-specific risk differentials are calculated.  \n \nCompany-specific discount rates are assigned a premium (penalty) or discount (benefit) risk differential relative \nto the GSF discount rate. These risk characteristics are measured in terms of size and leverage differentials. \nThese risk variables, also employed in credit analysis, are used as proxies for liquidity and financial risk. \nInvestors require a higher rate of return to compensate them for the additional risk. CS HOLT has empirically \nverified these risk characteristics to be the most statistically relevant to date. The discount rate uses equity \nmarket capitalization as a proxy for liquidity and leverage at market as a measure of financial risk. Greater \nfinancial leverage suggests a higher discount rate, while greater liquidity of traded shares (lower trading costs), \nsuggests a lower discount rate. Corporations must accept a higher weighted average cost of capital for having \nless stock liquidity and for taking on additional debt. In summary, the more risk the investor accepts (less \nliquidity and high leverage) the higher the required rate of return. \n \nThe CFROI model puts the tax deductibility of interest directly into the NCR stream through higher CFROIs \nresulting from lower taxes paid. From the owners\u2019 perspective (external to the firm), the cost of debt (or \nequity) capital is properly viewed as the return that bondholders (or common stock owners) expect to achieve \nin the future. Bondholders receive full interest and principal payments and their anticipated return is \nunderstated when the cost of debt capital is reduced by impounding the benefit of the tax deductibility of \ninterest payments as done in EVA models. This process allows a direct link between the investors\u2019 discount \nrate and the firms\u2019 cost of capital.  \n \nMeasuring Market-Derived Discount Rates \n \uf402\n Screen. CFROI discount rates are calculated by country/region. For each country/region, screen all the \ncompanies to develop an acceptable sample of well-behaved companies. The country/region groupings \nare based on a set of requirements, including a sufficient number of observations, adequate reported \nmarket and financial data, and sufficient model fit.  \n \uf402\n Calculate market-implied discount rates. The CFROI market\u2013derived discount rate is the rate at \nwhich CFROI NCR forecasts are discounted to equal the current market price for each stock. Since each \n"

CFROI discount rates are calculated using \nforecasted CFROI\u2019s, reinvestment rates and fade rates that drive NCR forecasts. These market-derived \ndiscount rates are integral to the rest of the CFROI valuation model and inherently dependent on fade \nrate and normalized growth rate assumptions. For each company, calculate market-implied discount rates \nusing NCR forecasts and market prices.  \n \uf402\n Run regression. Run multi-linear regression to measure the quantitative relationship between market-\nimplied discount rates and the risk characteristics of size (liquidity risk) and leverage (financial risk). A \nregression equation is produced using each company\u2019s market-implied discount rate as the dependent \nvariable regressed against leverage at market and the natural log (ln) of equity market cap (3 month \nrolling average) as the independent variables. The regression equation consists of an alpha (intercept), a \nsize coefficient and a leverage coefficient. This equation is calculated for every country/region and \nchanges weekly as stock prices change and forecasts are updated. \n \nDiscount Rate = \u03b1 + \u03b21 (ln(Size)) + \u03b22 (Lev) \n \uf402\n Calculate Global Standard Firm discount rates and company-specific risk differentials and \ndiscount rates. A company-specific discount rate can be determined by inserting the company\u2019s size \nand leverage forecast into the regression equation. However, for comparability and analysis reasons we \ncalculate a GSF (country, market or base) discount rate. The GSF is a hypothetical company based in \n1999 of US $5 billion size and 25 percent leverage. The GSF size is currency converted for each country \nand is scaled through time to the MSCI index. The correlated movement with the global market removes \nmarket growth (size) bias allowing comparison through time and selection of a consistent size and \nleverage all over the world permits analysis across countries. We use the GSF as a focal point to \nmeasure relative company-specific size and leverage differentials. The GSF is presented as a base, \ncountry or market rate but is actually just a reference point and theoretically can be any point on the \nregression line. The use of the GSF allows for comparable company-specific liquidity and financial risk \nwithin a market.  \n"
