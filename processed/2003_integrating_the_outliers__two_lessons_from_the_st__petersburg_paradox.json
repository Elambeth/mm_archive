      "text": "The risk-reducing formulas behind portfolio theory rely on a number of demanding and\nultimately unfounded premises. First, they suggest that price changes are statistically\nindependent from one another . . . The second assumption is that price changes are distributed\nin a pattern that conforms to a standard bell curve.\nDo financial data neatly conform to such assumptions? Of course, they never do.\nBenoit B. Mandelbrot\nA Multifractal Walk down Wall Street 1\nThe very fact that the Petersburg Problem has not yielded a unique and generally acceptable\nsolution to more than 200 years of attack by some of the world\u2019s great intellects suggests,\nindeed, that the growth-stock problem offers no hope of a satisfactory solution.\nDavid Durand\nGrowth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox 2\nBernoulli\u2019s Challenge\nCompetent investors take great pride in their ability to place an appropriate value on a financial\nclaim. This ability is the core of investing: Markets are just vehicles to trade cash for future\nclaims, and vice versa.\nO.K. Here\u2019s a cash flow stream for you to value: Say the house flips a fair coin. If it lands on\nheads, you receive $2 and the game ends. If it lands on tails, the house flips again. If the\nsecond flip lands on heads, you get $4; if it lands on tails, the game continues. For each\nsuccessive round, the payoff for landing on heads doubles (i.e., $2, $4, $8, $16, etc.) and you\nprogress to the next round until you land heads. How much would you pay to play this game?\nDaniel Bernoulli, one of a family of distinguished mathematicians, first presented this problem\nto the Imperial Academy of Sciences in 1738.3 Bernoulli\u2019s game, known as the St. Petersburg\nParadox, challenges classical theory, which says that a player should be willing to pay the\ngame\u2019s expected value to participate. The expected value of this game is infinite. Each round\nhas a payoff of $1 (probability of 1/2n and a payoff of $2n, or \u00bd x $2, \u00bc x $4, \u215bx $8, etc.) So,\nExpected value = 1 + 1 +1 + 1 . . . = \u221e\nNaturally, very few people would be willing to pay even $20 to play the game. Bernoulli tried to\nexplain the paradox with the marginal utility of money. He argued that the amount you\u2019d be\nwilling to pay is a function of your resources\u2014the greater your resources, the more you\u2019d be\nwilling to pay. Still, Bernoulli\u2019s explanation is not altogether satisfactory. The St. Petersburg\nParadox has kept philosophers, mathematicians, and economists thinking for over two-and-a-\nhalf centuries.4\nPhilosophical discourse aside, the St. Petersburg Paradox illuminates two very concrete ideas\nfor investors. The first is that the distribution of stock market returns does not follow the pattern\nthat standard finance theory assumes. This deviation from theory is important for risk\nmanagement, market efficiency, and individual stock selection.\nMichael J. Mauboussin\n212-325-3108\nmichael.mauboussin@csfb.com\nKristen Bartholdson\n212-325-2788\nkristen.bartholdson@csfb.com\nJanuary 28, 2003\nVolume 2, Issue 2\nIntegrating the Outliers\nTwo Lessons from the St. Petersburg Paradox\n"

      "text": "Page 2\nThe second idea relates to valuing growth stocks. What do you pay today for a business with a low\nprobability of an extraordinarily high payoff? This question is more pressing than ever in a world with violent\nvalue migrations and increasing returns.\nWhat\u2019s Normal?\nAsset price distributions are of great practical significance for portfolio managers. Standard finance theory\nassumes that asset price changes follow a normal distribution\u2014the well-known bell curve. That this\nassumption is roughly accurate most of the time allows analysts to use very robust probability statistics. For\nexample, for a sample that follows a normal distribution, you can identify the population average and\ncharacterize the likelihood of variance from that average.\nHowever, much of nature\u2014including the man-made stock market\u2014is not normal.5 Many natural systems\nhave two defining characteristics: an ever-larger number of smaller pieces and similar-looking pieces across\nthe different size scales. For example, a tree has a large trunk and a number of ever-smaller branches, and\nthe small branches resemble the big branches. These systems are fractal. Unlike a normal distribution, no\naverage value adequately characterizes a fractal system. Exhibit 1 contrasts normal and fractal systems\nvisually and shows the probability functions that represent the data. Fractal systems follow a power law.6\nExhibit 1: Probability Density Functions for Normal and Fractal Systems\nProbability\nPayoff\nSample\nSample\nLog (Probability)\nLog (Payoff)\nNormal\nFractal\nProbability\nPayoff\nProbability\nPayoff\nSample\nSample\nSample\nSample\nLog (Probability)\nLog (Payoff)\nLog (Probability)\nLog (Payoff)\nNormal\nFractal\nSource: Larry S. Liebovitch and Daniela Scheurle, \u201cTwo Lessons from Fractals and Chaos,\u201d Complexity, Vol. 5, 4, 2000.\nUsing the statistics of normal distributions to characterize a fractal system like financial markets is potentially\nvery hazardous. Yet theoreticians and practitioners do it daily.7 The distinction between the two systems\nboils down to probabilities and payoffs. Fractal systems have few, very large observations that fall outside\nthe normal distribution. The classic example is the crash of 1987. The probability (assuming a normal\ndistribution) of the market\u2019s 20%-plus plunge in one day was so infinitesimally low it was practically zero.\nAnd still the losses were a staggering $2 trillion-plus.\nA comparison of a normal coin toss game and the St. Petersburg game illustrates the point. Assume that\nyou toss a coin and receive $2 if it lands heads and nothing if it lands tails. The expected value of the game\nis $1, the amount you would be willing to pay to play the game in a fair casino. We simulated 1 million\nrounds of 100 tosses each, and plotted the payoffs in Exhibit 2. Just as you would expect, we got a well-\ndefined normal distribution.8\n"

For example, half the time the game\nonly pays $2, and three-quarters of the time it pays $4 or less. However, a run of 30 provides a $1.1 billion\npayoff, but is only a 1-in-1.1 billion probability. Lots of small events and a few very large events characterize\na fractal system. Further, the average winnings per game is unstable with the St. Petersburg game, so no\naverage accurately describes the game\u2019s long-term outcome.\nExhibit 3: Fractal Coin Toss Game\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n24\n29\nLog (Payoff)\nLog (Probability)\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n24\n29\nLog (Payoff)\nLog (Probability)\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n24\n29\nLog (Payoff)\nLog (Probability)\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n24\n29\nLog (Payoff)\nLog (Probability)\nSource: CSFB analysis.\nAre stock market returns fractal? Benoit Mandelbrot shows that by lengthening or shortening the horizontal\naxis of a price series\u2014effectively speeding up or slowing down time\u2014prices series are indeed fractal. Not\nonly are rare large changes interspersed with lots of smaller one, the price changes look similar at various\nscales (e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly returns). Mandelbrot calls financial time series multifractal, adding\nthe prefix \u201cmulti\u201d to capture the time adjustment.\nIn an important and fascinating book, Why Stock Markets Crash, geophysicist Didier Sornette argues that\nstock market distributions comprise two different populations, the body (which you can model with standard\ntheory) and the tail (which relies on completely different mechanisms). Sornette\u2019s analysis of market\ndrawdowns convincingly dismisses the assumption that stock returns are independent, a key pillar of\nclassical finance theory. His work provides fresh and thorough evidence of finance theory\u2019s shortcomings.9\n"

      "text": "Page 4\nSt. Petersburg and Growth Stock Investing\nThe St. Petersburg Paradox also provides insight for growth stock valuation.10 What should you be willing to\npay for a very small probability that a company can grow its cash flows by a very significant amount\nforever?11\nDavid Durand took up this question in his classic 1957 article, \u201cGrowth Stocks and the Petersburg\nParadox.\u201d12 He encourages a good deal of caution, emphasizing reversion-to-the-mean thinking and\nmodeling. But if anything, the challenge to value the low probability of significant value is even more\npressing today than it was when Durand took on the challenge 45 years ago.\nConsider, for example, that of the nearly 2,000 technology initial public offerings since 1980, only 5%\naccount for over 100% of the $2-trillion-plus in wealth creation.13 And even within this small wealth-\ngenerating group, only a handful delivered the bulk of the huge payoffs. Given the winner-take-most\ncharacteristics of many growth markets, there\u2019s little reason to anticipate a more normal wealth-creation\ndistribution in the future.\nIn addition, the data show that the distribution of economic return on investment is wider in corporate\nAmerica today than it was in the past.14 So the spoils awaiting the wealth creators, given their outsized\nreturns, are greater than ever before. Like the St. Petersburg game, the majority of the payoffs from future\ndeals are likely to be modest, but some will be huge. What\u2019s the expected value? What should you be willing\nto pay to play?\nIntegrating the Outliers\nThe St. Petersburg Paradox may be centuries old, but its lessons are as fresh as ever. One of the major\nchallenges in investing is how to capture (or avoid) low-probability, high-impact events. Unfortunately,\nstandard finance theory has little to say about the subject.\n____________________________\n1 Benoit B.
