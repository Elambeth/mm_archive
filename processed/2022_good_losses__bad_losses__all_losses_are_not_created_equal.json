It is the result of damage to specific regions in the brain \nand is usually caused by a stroke. Patients who suffer from aphasia \nunderstand images, ideas, or concepts but cannot convey them in \nwords. The term comes from the Greek aphatos, or \u201cspeechless.\u201d1 \nAccounting is commonly called the language of business.2 It is how \na company communicates its economic results and financial \nposition to current and prospective stakeholders, including \nshareholders, creditors, suppliers, and employees. These \nstakeholders want to know whether the company has a good \nbusiness. Core considerations include the company\u2019s growth, \nprofitability, return on investment, and financial strength. \nAccounting can be aphasic. In many cases, the bottom-line figures \nthat are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles \n(GAAP) fail to communicate the essence of a company\u2019s \neconomics. For example, there has been a steady rise in the use \nand utility of non-GAAP figures, calculations that deviate from the \naccounting rules and regulations.3 More than 95 percent of \ncompanies in the S&P 500 report non-GAAP numbers, and there \nis evidence that investors find them useful.4 Overall, understanding \nwhether a company\u2019s business is fundamentally sound requires \ngoing deeper than superficial sums or ratios.5  \nInvestors often demarcate between profitable and unprofitable \ncompanies, as measured by net income. Net income is the profit \nafter subtracting all costs, expenses, and taxes from sales. Exhibit \n1 shows that one-third of the companies in the Russell 3000, which \ntracks the largest stocks by market capitalization in the United \nStates, reported negative net income in 2021. This ratio has been \nclimbing in recent decades. Non-GAAP results swing about a fifth \nof them into positive territory. Some adjustments make sense, \nincluding adding back truly one-time or non-economic expenses, \nwhereas others, such as adding back the expense for stock-based \ncompensation, do not.6 What we want to investigate is how much \ninformation is contained in simple profits or losses. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

All rights reserved. \n5845839 Exp. 7/31/2024 \n3 \n \nThe answer is that Company A and Company B have the exact same value, and Company C is worth \nconsiderably less. Take a look at the appendix if you want more complete numbers. The key is to calculate free \ncash flow, defined as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus the investment in future growth. Free cash \nflow is the lifeblood of corporate value as it measures the cash that a firm can distribute to its creditors and \nshareholders. Note that negative free cash flow is not only fine, but desirable, in cases when the return on \ninvestment comfortably exceeds the cost of capital and the company has access to capital.    \nCompany A and Company B have identical free cash flows. What is different is where the investments show up \nin the financial statements according to the rules of accounting. For Company A, investments are captured on \nthe balance sheet, which is revealed by examining the change in invested capital from one year to the next.  \nFor Company B, most of the investments are expensed on the income statement. The figures for Company A \nare typical of a firm that invests primarily in tangible assets, including capital expenditures for machines and \nfactories. Those for Company B are common for a company that invests mostly in intangible assets, non-physical \nitems such as software code and marketing to build a brand. \nLet\u2019s do the calculations to show the equivalence. We\u2019ll focus on year two. Company A has NOPAT of $211.6 \nand an investment of $317.4 for total free cash flow of -$105.8. You can compute the investment by looking at \nthe change in invested capital ($317.4 = $1,593.4 - $1,276.0).  \nCompany B has NOPAT of -$58.2, investment of $47.6, and free cash flow of -$105.8. But note that Company \nB reflects $269.8 of selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense on the income statement even though \nit is really an investment. Were the company to record that investment on the balance sheet instead of the \nincome statement, NOPAT would go from -$58.2 to $211.6, investment would rise from $47.6 to $317.4, and \nfree cash flow would stay the same.  \nCompany B would in fact be more valuable in the real world because the investments it expenses create a \nvaluable tax shield. That means that Company B would pay less in taxes than Company A.  \nWe can also do a back of the envelope calculation of the return on investment, which we define here as the \nchange in this year\u2019s NOPAT divided by last year\u2019s investment. In other words, how much did earnings grow this \nyear as a result of last year\u2019s investment? Again, we\u2019ll start with Company A and look at years 2 and 3. In this \ncase, the return on investment is 10 percent, or a change in NOPAT of $31.7 ($243.3 - $211.6) divided by the \ninvestment of $317.4.  \nThe unadjusted figures for Company B appear nonsensical. But if you make the adjustments, the figures for \nCompany B align exactly with those of Company A. Here again, you have to think about investment and return \non investment clearly to see these businesses are indeed the same. \nCompany C has the same NOPAT as Company A but its investment of $396.8 is much higher. As a result, its \nfree cash flow is -$185.1 and its return is 8 percent ($31.7 \u00f7 $396.8). Company C\u2019s investments yield a lower \nreturn than that of companies A and B.  \nWe designed this example so that the level of investment, return on investment, and growth are identical for \ncompanies A and B. But the accounting differs because one invests in tangible assets and the other in intangible \nassets. The concepts are the same, but the communication is different. This is accounting aphasia.  \n \n"

Real losers also have expenses that exceed sales. Gu, Lev, and Zhu focus on how the \nvaluation and stock price performance of these categories differ.  \nExhibit 1 shows that the percentage of companies reporting losses has increased in recent decades. We want \nto understand whether that rise reflects GAAP-driven or real losses. There are spikes in losses that coincide \nwith periods of economic decline, but the underlying driver of the trend is the rise of intangible investment. \nExhibit 3 illustrates the point. In 2001, intangible investments were on par with capital expenditures for \ncompanies in the Russell 3000. Twenty years later, intangible investments were roughly double capital \nexpenditures.   \nTo cast all companies in a similar light, the professors adjusted the GAAP accounting by recording the intangible \ninvestment on the balance sheet and replacing the expense on the income statement with the amortization of \nthe capitalized intangibles.8 This treats capital expenditures and intangible investments in the same way.9 The \nresearchers found that this modification flipped about 40 percent of the reported losses to profits and improved \nthe relevance of earnings.10 \nExhibit 3: Intangible Investments Are on the Rise \n \nSource: Based on Luminita Enache and Anup Srivastava, \u201cShould Intangible Investments Be Reported Separately or \nCommingled with Operating Expenses?

All rights reserved. \n5845839 Exp. 7/31/2024 \n5 \n \nThe main message is that an investor should focus on understanding a business\u2019s investments, return on \ninvestments, and opportunities for investment. Taken together, these are the value drivers that determine long-\nterm free cash flow.  \nAccountants have to adhere to generally accepted accounting principles that are well established and \nconservative. The problem is that these principles can obscure the value drivers that investors and other \nstakeholders seek to comprehend and forecast.  \nStock prices reflect a company\u2019s current financial position plus a set of expectations about its future financial \nresults.11 We want to know if investors sort good and bad losses effectively when they value businesses. \nWhy Investors Should Care   \nGu, Lev, and Zhu not only make adjustments to more accurately reflect profit, but they also examine the total \nshareholder returns for the stocks of the GAAP losers relative to profitable firms as well as the real losers. Exhibit \n4 shows the results for the period from 1980 to 2017. The companies in each category are matched for size, \nvaluation, industry, and year so as to isolate the profit effect. They found that $1 grew to $20.82 when invested \nin the GAAP losers, $7.65 in the profitable firms, and just $1.90 in the real losers. The respective compound \nannual growth rates in total shareholder returns are 11.5, 7.5, and 2.3 percent.    \nThese long-term results obscure an important shift. From 1980 to 1996, just under one-half of the full period, the \nGAAP losers outperformed real losers but underperformed profitable firms. It was only in the last two decades \nof the measured period that the GAAP losers delivered higher returns than both the real losers and profitable \nfirms.12 The message is that the market ultimately recognizes and pays for intangible investments that create \nvalue, even if they create losses in the short term. \nExhibit 4: Growth of One Dollar Invested in Matched Companies: GAAP Losers, Profitable \nFirms, and Real Losers, 1980-2017 \n \nSource: Based on Feng Gu, Baruch Lev, and Chenqi Zhu, \u201cAll Losses Are Not Alike: Real versus Accounting-Driven \nReported Losses,\u201d SSRN Working Paper, May 2022. \nNote: Firms matched by size, price/book, industry, and year; GAAP=Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; The growth \nof one dollar is hypothetical and based on actual historical information and should not be construed as an indication of \nfuture results. \n$20.82\n$7.65\n$1.90\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nGAAP Losers\nProfitable Firms\nReal Losers\nGrowth of One Dollar Invested, 1980-2017\n"

All rights reserved. \n5845839 Exp. 7/31/2024 \n6 \n \nConclusion \nAccounting is the language of business that allows a company to share its financial results with interested \nstakeholders. Certain principles guide how accountants reflect the range of business activities on financial \nstatements.  \nOne principle of accounting is conservatism, which says that companies should be prudent when recognizing \nitems that have uncertain future benefits.13 For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the \nStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 in October 1974 that stipulated that research and \ndevelopment costs, a classic form of intangible investment, should be expensed immediately because of \u201ca high \ndegree of uncertainty about the future benefits of individual research and development projects.\u201d14 Today, most \nintangible investments are subject to this principle. \nThe rise of intangibles in recent decades means that more investments than ever are expensed immediately \nversus capitalized on the balance sheet and amortized on the income statement consistent with the principle \nthat sales and expenses should be matched over time. This makes the income statements and balance sheets \nof today appear distorted relative to those of the past. In particular, some businesses with high return on \ninvestment have losses. Academics call these companies GAAP losers to distinguish them from real losers, \nbusinesses that have expenses unrelated to investment that exceed sales. \nCapitalizing intangible investments and amortizing them makes the economic picture clearer. It allows investors \nto sort companies losing money for the right reasons and improves the relevance of earnings. Core concepts \nare communicated more clearly. \nEvidence from recent decades shows that GAAP losers produced attractive total shareholder returns relative to \nthe real losers and profitable companies. Investors must look past simple measures of profits to understand a \nbusiness\u2019s true ability to create value.   \n \nPlease see important disclosures on pages 11-13  \n \n \n"
