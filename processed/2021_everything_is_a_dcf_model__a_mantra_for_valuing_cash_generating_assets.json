A trained lawyer and former banker, \nLevine is smart, entertaining, and informative.1 He also likes to use \na handful of themes to create context for his observations about \nbusiness, law, and the markets.  \nOne of his favorites is \u201ceverything is securities fraud.\u201d2 The basic \nidea is that whenever something bad happens to a company \ncausing its stock to decline, someone will accuse the management \nof acting nefariously. In the same vein, we want to suggest the \nmantra \u201ceverything is a DCF model.\u201d The point is that whenever \ninvestors value a stake in a cash-generating asset, they should \nrecognize that they are using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.  \nThis is important because an investor, from a venture capitalist to \na manager with a portfolio of large-capitalization stocks, owns \npartial stakes in businesses. The value of those businesses is the \npresent value of the cash they can distribute to their owners. \nThis suggests a mindset that is very different from that of a \nspeculator, who buys a stock in anticipation that it will go up without \nreference to its value. Investors and speculators have always \ncoexisted in markets, and the behavior of many market participants \nis a blend of the two. But it is useful to keep in mind that these are \nseparate activities.  \nNote, too, that \u201ceverything is a DCF model\u201d does not apply to \nassets that do not generate cash flows, including cryptocurrencies, \nart, wine, and gold.3 All of these assets may be of value and many \nof them have appreciated over time, but they are not subject to \nwhat John Burr Williams, an economist and author of the 1938 \nclassic book The Theory of Investment Value, called \u201cevaluation by \nthe rule of present worth.\u201d4 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

Further, many practitioners use heuristics for value without recognizing \nthe purpose and limitations of the shorthands. \nAt the end of the day, the intrinsic value, determined by the present value of future cash flows, attracts the price \nlike a magnetic force. This means that investors always have to keep in mind the value drivers of a discounted \ncash flow model. It is easy to forget but useful to remember.     \nThe Wonder of Markets \nPublic stock exchanges are wondrous. When you buy a stock, you trade cash for a portion of the future cash \nflows of a business. When you sell a stock, you trade the cash flows for cash. It\u2019s a form of time travel: if you \nbuy a stock at a price less than its perceived value, you are essentially traveling into the future and judging that \ntoday\u2019s expectations for future cash flows are too low. Selling stock that is perceived to be overvalued is a \nsymmetrical move.  \nThe founder, buyer, or holder of a business anticipates satisfactory returns based on the company\u2019s distributable \ncash flows over time. Cash flows are defined as the difference between profits after taxes and the investments \nrequired to sustain or grow the business. This is as relevant for a small business in the local community as it is \nfor a company in the S&P 500. When an owner sells a business, the rights to the cash flow and the associated \nrisk and reward are transferred to the new holder.        \nPrivate markets are in some ways different than public markets, but the driver of value is the same. Private \nmarkets generally have less liquidity, a measure of how cheap and easy it is to buy and sell stakes in companies, \nthan do public markets. As a result, investors in private markets expect an illiquidity premium, a little extra return \nto pay them for the inability to transact cheaply.6 That premium is compensation for the friction of buying and \nselling. But future cash flows still determine the value of the underlying assets. \nInvestors in private markets generally have more control over businesses than do investors in public markets. \nFor example, most venture capitalists work closely with the entrepreneurs in whom they invest, sitting on their \nboards and making key introductions. Buyout firms also have tight control over their portfolio companies, allowing \nthe buyout firms to put in place strong governance practices, including an ability to make changes swiftly and \ndecisively. Control allows private equity investors to be proactive about placing a firm on a path to generating \nstrong long-term cash flows. \nAnother distinguishing feature of private markets is limited price discovery, a fancy way of saying that prices are \nnot set by a market with lots of willing buyers and sellers. For example, in venture capital the price of a new \nround of financing is often set by the buyer who is willing to pay most for the stake, and those who think the price \nis too high have no ready way to sell.  \nSomething similar is true for buyouts. If a buyout firm seeks to acquire a public company, it may have to contend \nwith competing bids from other buyout funds or strategic buyers. But in most cases, the highest bidder wins the \nauction. As with venture capital, there are lots of potential buyers but only one seller. Price discovery is weak in \nprivate markets because the optimists can buy but the pessimists can\u2019t sell.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n5845811 Exp. 07/31/2024 \n3 \n \nThe decision to be private or public boils down to the tradeoff between better governance for companies held by \nprivate equity firms and a lower cost of capital for public companies in a portfolio.7 \nPrivate equity investments are generally riskier than those in public markets. Risk for venture capital firms comes \nfrom investing in new or young businesses that have yet to demonstrate their long-term viability. Risk for buyout \nfirms is the result of financial leverage.  \nThese observations are borne out in the distribution of returns for individual investments across the asset \nclasses. From the mid-1990s to 2018, about 60 percent of venture capital investments lost money, but the \nhandful that did exceedingly well allowed the overall asset class to generate competitive returns. Roughly 27 \npercent of buyout deals lost money, the median investment approximately doubled, and some did very well \n(though not as well as venture deals). From 1985 to 2019, nearly 25 percent of public market investments lost \nmoney over 5 years, and the losses were on average less severe than those in private equity.8 But the lower \nrisk meant lower returns, with the upside outliers contributing less to returns than in private equity.   \nPrivate equity funds have to sell their investments eventually to realize returns for their fundholders. And when \nthey sell, they essentially transfer the problem of assessing future cash flows to the new buyers, whether a \ncompany, another fund, or an active portfolio manager. Everything is a DCF model. \nWhy Doesn\u2019t Everyone Believe?          \nThe time value of money, the idea that money today is worth more than an identical amount of money in the \nfuture, is one of the first concepts taught in a finance class. As a discounted cash flow model formalizes this \nconcept, it stands to reason that it should be the primary method for investors to value financial assets, including \nstocks, and for corporate managers to allocate capital.9  \nHowever, a recent survey of professional equity analysts found that \u201cmarket multiples\u201d were \u201c[b]y far the most \npopular approach to valuation\u201d among nearly 2,000 respondents.10 Specifically, these analysts said that when \nvaluing companies they used price-earnings multiples 88 percent of the time and enterprise value-to-earnings \nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiples 77 percent of the time. \nThe discounted cash flow model was the second most popular approach to valuation, albeit more popular in \nregions outside the Americas. While this sounds encouraging, there are two substantial caveats.  \nThe first is that analysts commonly use an enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple to estimate the continuing value, \nalso known as the terminal or residual value, in a DCF model.11 The continuing value often represents 70 to 80 \npercent of corporate value.12 That means that what drives the DCF model is for the most part a dressed up \nmultiple.   \nThe second concern is that many DCF models are done poorly, having errors related to theory and dubious \neconomic judgments.13 Errors include the use of a faulty risk-free rate and assuming unrealistic growth rates in \nthe calculation of continuing value. An example of a poor judgment is an explicit forecast period that is too short. \nThese shortcomings speak poorly not about the approach but rather to how it is applied.  \nWe think there are a number of reasons a DCF model is not used more consistently and properly, in private and \npublic markets: \n \n"

Markets are not completely efficient, of course, but by \nand large markets are reasonably effective at reflecting known information in prices. While price and value \ncan and do diverge, the wisdom of crowds reminds us that the collective opinion of the market is generally \na better judge of price than a single person\u2019s estimation.14 \nCharley Ellis, founder of Greenwich Associates and a luminary in the investment industry for more than a \nhalf century, writes playfully, \u201cIf you could have anyone\u2014and everyone\u2014you ever wanted as colleague-\ninvestors working with you all day, every day, which great investors would you include on your investor\u2019s \ndream team?\u201d He goes on, \u201c. . . today\u2019s professional-dominated stock market reflects the accumulated \nexpertise of all those diligent experts making their best judgments on pricing all the time.\u201d15 \nBecause the market is likely to be better at valuation than they are, most investors can defer to its ability to \nreflect what\u2019s out there. They can then turn their attention to whether a company\u2019s fundamental results will \nbe better or worse than the market\u2019s expectations. The problem is that without a clear understanding of \nwhat is priced in, there is no easy way to know how changes in the consensus will affect the stock price. \n\u2022 Small changes in assumptions for a DCF model can lead to large changes in value. As a result, many \ninvestors are more comfortable using multiples of earnings or cash flow as proxies for valuation. Multiples \nare a shorthand for the valuation process that have the benefit of saving the user time at the cost of buried \nassumptions.  \nJohn Burr Williams anticipated concerns about the inputs into a discounted cash flow model. In chapter 15 \nof his book, called \u201cA Chapter for Skeptics,\u201d he wrote, \u201c. . . the old-fashioned methods of appraisal in reality \ntook cognizance of all the factors which give such intricacy to the new formulas, but the old methods did so \nimplicitly, whereas the new methods do so explicitly.\u201d16  \nIn other words, valuation using multiples does not avoid the drivers of long-term cash flows but rather \nobscures them. Williams argues that it is better to make your assumptions explicit and debate them than to \nmake them implicit and ignore them. \n\u2022 Lots of valuation is done by comparing. There are two ways to come up with a value for a financial \nasset. The first is to calculate an intrinsic value by discounting future cash flows. If the stock market is \nefficient, price and value will be the same. The second is to compare investments that are similar and buy \nthe relatively undervalued one and sell the overvalued one. If a sufficient number of investors are doing \nthis, few will outperform the market. The first approach assumes that prices are right while the second \nposits only that it is hard to beat the market.17  \nBoth of these approaches have deep roots in finance. Models based on general equilibrium determine \nintrinsic value. Other models, including options pricing models, derive value from an underlying asset \nwithout concern for whether it is priced correctly.   \nArbitrage in its purest form involves comparing prices of the same asset, say on separate exchanges, and \nsimultaneously buying at the low price and selling at the high price to lock in a riskless profit. Such \nopportunities are extremely rare. Often there are costs to implementing arbitrage that offset the gains. \nArbitrage activities today generally include buying and selling assets that are similar rather than identical, \nwhich introduces more risk.18  \nRelying solely on comparison presents a pair of challenges. One is that investors often select comparable \nassets to support the case they are making.19 For example, if an analyst wants to recommend that the \n"

Something may look \nrelatively attractive but still may be absolutely overvalued. An investor can isolate a mispricing by going \nlong one asset and short another, removing exposure to absolute valuation. But this activity introduces new \nchallenges, including identifying stocks that are close substitutes and the mechanics and costs of shorting.  \n\u2022 Valuation is tricky early in a company\u2019s life cycle. Start-ups are difficult to value using a discounted \ncash flow model because the range of potential outcomes is so great. The dispersion of growth rates in \nsales and profits narrows as companies get bigger, which makes the task easier as companies grow and \nmature. But Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance and expert in valuation, argues that a DCF model \ncan be used for start-ups and he provides a multi-step process to do so.20  \nDamodaran\u2019s steps boil down to forecasting revenues, estimating profitability, assessing risk, and \nconsidering base rates.  \nForecasting a range of potential revenues benefits from a thoughtful assessment of total addressable \nmarket (TAM). We believe that TAM can be estimated by a bottom up calculation of the market size, \napplication of a diffusion model, and reference to past results of similar businesses.21 \nThe basic unit of analysis provides insight into how a company makes money. For example, the basic unit \nof analysis in a subscription business is customer lifetime value, which estimates the cash flow a customer \nwill generate while active and subtracts the cost of acquiring the customer.22 This step can take into \nconsideration potential benefits from operating leverage and economies of scale.  \nRisk includes an estimation of the opportunity cost of capital and how it changes over time. The risk and \nexpected return of a company\u2019s stock tend to decline as the company moves through its life cycle. \nBase rates, the results of an appropriate reference class of companies, are useful for assessing survival \nand growth. This is a powerful and underutilized tool for forecasting. \n\u2022 It is hard to value companies that have negative net income. Nearly 40 percent of public companies in \nthe United States had negative net income in 2020. Companies can lose money for two reasons. The first \nis that costs exceed revenues and the company is fundamentally unprofitable. The second is the company \nexpenses investments today that are expected to generate attractive cash flows in the future.  \nThe latter occurs as a quirk of accounting. Tangible investments, such as capital expenditures, are recorded \non the balance sheet and only the depreciation of the assets shows up on the income statement. Intangible \ninvestments, such as marketing spending, are reflected in full on the income statement. This accounting \ntreatment of intangible assets overstates expenses and understates investment and therefore obscures the \neconomic picture.   \nBecause investments precede sales and earnings, a profitable company reliant on intangible assets that is \ngrowing rapidly will report negative net income even as its business is thriving. Indeed, companies should \ninvest more than they earn if the return on investment is attractive and they have access to capital. \nSuccessful companies reliant on tangible assets such as Walmart and Home Depot had years of negative \nfree cash flow in their growth stages even as they were creating substantial shareholder value.  \n"

All rights reserved. \n5845811 Exp. 07/31/2024 \n6 \n \nThe answer to this challenge is not to fall back on heuristics, such as multiples of price to sales, but to \nadjust the financial statements to make them more accurate. This requires shifting intangible investments \nfrom the income statement to the balance sheet, leaving only an amortization expense on the income \nstatement. The net result is higher earnings, a bigger balance sheet, and a better sense of the magnitude \nof investment and return on capital.23 \nEach of these reasons helps explain why DCF models are not used more widely, but none of them stand up to \nscrutiny. Even if you choose not to build a DCF model for every investment you make, it is useful to keep in mind \nthe factors that drive value. These include growth from investments that earn in excess of the cost of capital, the \ncompetitive advantage or uniqueness of a business that keeps competitors at bay, and the opportunity cost of \ncapital. You have to earn the right to use a multiple, which happens when you can demonstrate the link between \nvalue and the multiple.24  \nAnother effective way to use the model is to ask what you have to believe about the value drivers to justify \ntoday\u2019s price. This approach singlehandedly addresses all of the common concerns about a DCF model. Instead \nof an investor determining value, he or she needs only to assess whether the expectations embedded in the \nshares are likely to be met.25 \nHow DCF Models Apply More Broadly \nThe application of a DCF model in valuation is more prevalent in some assets than others. Corporate bonds are \nan example where investors commonly use DCF models. A company that issues a bond makes a legal \ncommitment to make timely interest payments on the principal and to return the principal at maturity. The key \nelements of a DCF model are the magnitude, timing, and riskiness of cash flows. Bonds specify by contract the \nmagnitude and timing of cash flows, leaving the risk that the company will not be able to meet its obligations as \nthe main source of judgment.  \nBonds are different than stocks in that with a bond the company will meet all its commitments if everything goes \nright. There is no upside, only downside if the company defaults. Bondholders get paid before stockholders, \nwhich means that bonds generally have less risk than stocks.  \nA stock is a residual claim on cash flows, which means there is upside if the results are better than expected. \nBonds are more about not being wrong and stocks are more about being right. Benjamin Graham and David \nDodd, authors of the book Security Analysis that formalized the process of investing, said it this way: \u201c. . . bond \nselection is primarily a negative art. It is a process of exclusion and rejection, rather than of search and \nacceptance. In this respect the contrast with common-stock selection is fundamental in character.\u201d26 \nThe discounted cash flow model also works for real estate.27 Owners of commercial real estate commonly seek \nto buy a building based on its potential net operating income (NOI), a measure of cash flow calculated as rental \nor lease income minus operating expenses. These cash flows are discounted at a capitalization rate, or cap rate, \nwhich is the investor\u2019s required rate of return. For example, if a building has NOI of $50,000 and a market value \nof $1 million, the cap rate is 5 percent. Cap rates capture the risk associated with a building\u2019s cash flows. \nWe generally don\u2019t think about valuing our homes using a DCF model, but in fact it applies to residential real \nestate as well. Economists define cash flows as the rent the house would generate minus the expenses \nassociated with owning a home, including property taxes, insurance, and upkeep. They then estimate the rate \nof return by combining these interim cash flows with lumpy cash flows, the entry and exit price.28 This approach \n"

But the topic of asset \nvalue deserves a brief comment. One of the criticisms of a DCF model is its sensitivity to inputs, where small \nchanges in assumptions can lead to large changes in output. An alternate approach builds on layers of value, \nincluding asset value, earnings power, and franchise value. The bedrock is asset value, deemed to be tangible \nand reliable, which appears to sidestep the problem of garbage in, garbage out.30  \nThe calculation of asset value requires going through the balance sheet line by line and adjusting the figures \nrecorded by the accountants to reflect market or reproduction values. For example, if a company carries a \nmachine on its books at $100 that is worth $150, the company\u2019s book value would increase by $50, all else \nbeing equal.  \nThe important insight is that asset values themselves are based on the present value of cash flows. Considering \nwhat an asset might fetch in the market or what it might cost to build it anew goes right back to the problem of \nforecasting and discounting cash flows. That this skirts the issue is an illusion.    \nThe purchaser of a company in a leveraged buyout seeks a business with predictable cash flows and uses a \nrelatively large amount of debt to finance the deal. Buyout firms focus intently on improving cash flows during \nthe time they own a business, a median of five years, and often dedicate those cash flows to reducing debt. The \ntotal return from the deal requires consideration of the entry price, the interim cash flows, and the exit price. Exit \nmultiples in recent decades have been on average higher than entry multiples, leading to satisfactory returns for \nbuyout funds.   \nVenture capital is the other large part of private equity. We have already discussed the process to value a start-\nup. But another important feature of venture funding is that it tends to go in stages. Each successive round of \nfunding, denoted as Series A, Series B, etc., tends to be contingent on a company meeting certain performance \nmetrics. This can be modeled as a series of real options.31 An option is a right but not an obligation to do \nsomething. Real options derive their value from real investments as opposed to financial investments such as \nstocks.    \nOption pricing models create a portfolio that is a mix of the underlying asset and the risk-free rate to replicate \nthe cash flows of the option.32 The models then rely on arbitrage as the value of the option and the value of the \nreplicating portfolio should be the same. Options derive their value from another asset, but their value is still \npegged to expected cash flows.     \nConclusion   \nThe value of an asset that produces cash is the present value of the cash flows it generates over its life. Few \ninvestors explicitly use a DCF model all the time, but it is useful to keep the drivers of the model in mind \nconstantly.  \nThe ideas behind a DCF model have been around for a very long time. Warren Buffett, chairman and chief \nexecutive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, suggests they were introduced more than 2,500 years ago:33 \n"

He wrote (Theory of Investment Value, 188): \u201cThose who feel it \nunsound to use long-range forecasts under any circumstances may still use the new formulas another way, a \nway that was almost impossible with the old methods. They may transpose the new formulas and use the actual \nmarket price as a datum, instead of seeking the theoretical investment value as an answer. Then with the \ntransposed formulas they may deduce the particular rate of growth, the particular duration of growth, or the like, \nthat is implied by the actual market price, and see in this way whether the prevailing price is reasonable or not.\u201d \nFor a contemporary discussion of this approach, see Michael J.
