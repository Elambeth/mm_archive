      "text": "\u201cIn the real world there is no \u2018easy way\u2019 to assure a financial profit. At least, it is gratifying to\nrationalize that we would rather lose intelligently than win ignorantly.\u201d\nRichard A. Epstein\nThe Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic\nBatting with the Babe\nA well-known and very successful portfolio manager recently told us a story that initially sounded\nincongruous. He explained that he was one of roughly 20 portfolio managers running money for a\ncompany. The company\u2019s treasurer, dismayed with the aggregate performance of his active\nmanagers, decided to evaluate each manager\u2019s decision process in an effort to weed out the poor\nperformers. The treasurer figured that even a random process would result in a portfolio of stocks\nwith roughly one-half outperforming the benchmark (in this case the S&P 500) and the other half\nunderperforming it. So he measured each portfolio based on what percentage of its stocks beat\nthe market.\nThe portfolio manager found himself in an unusual position. While his total portfolio performance\nwas among the best in the group, he was among the worst based on this batting average. After\nhaving fired all of the other \u201cpoor\u201d performing managers, the treasurer called a meeting with this\nportfolio manager to sort out the divergence between the good performance and the \u201cbad\u201d batting\naverage.\nThe portfolio manager\u2019s explanation for the discrepancy underscores a lesson inherent in any\nprobabilistic exercise: the frequency of correctness does not matter; it is the magnitude of\ncorrectness that matters. Say that you own four stocks, and that three of the stocks go down a bit\nbut the fourth rises substantially. The portfolio will perform well even as the majority of the stocks\ndecline.\nBuilding a portfolio that can deliver superior performance requires that you evaluate each\ninvestment using expected value analysis. What is striking is that the leading thinkers across\nvaried fields\u2014including horse betting, casino gambling, and investing\u2014all emphasize the same\npoint.1 We call it the Babe Ruth effect: even though Ruth struck out a lot, he was one of baseball\u2019s\ngreatest hitters.\nThe reason that the lesson about expected value is universal is that all probabilistic exercises\nhave similar features. Internalizing this lesson, on the other hand, is difficult because it runs\nagainst human nature in a very fundamental way. While it\u2019s not hard to show the flaw in the\ntreasurer\u2019s logic, it\u2019s easy to sympathize with his thinking.\nThe Downside of Hard Wiring\nIn 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky outlined prospect theory, which identifies economic\nbehaviors that are inconsistent with rational decision-making.2 One of the most significant insights\nfrom the theory is that people exhibit significant aversion to losses when making choices between\nrisky outcomes, no matter how small the stakes. In fact, Kahneman and Tversky found that a loss\nhas about two and a half times the impact of a gain of the same size. In other words, people feel a\nlot worse about losses of a given size than they feel good about a gain of a similar magnitude.\nMichael J.

      "text": "Page 2\nThis behavioral fact means that people are a lot happier when they are right frequently. What\u2019s interesting is that\nbeing right frequently is not necessarily consistent with an investment portfolio that outperforms its benchmark (as\nthe story above illustrates). The percentage of stocks that go up in a portfolio does not determine its performance, it\nis the dollar change in the portfolio. A few stocks going up or down dramatically will often have a much greater\nimpact on portfolio performance than the batting average.\nBulls, Bears and Odds\nIn his wonderful book, Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Taleb relates an anecdote that beautifully drives home the\nexpected value message.3 In a meeting with his fellow traders, a colleague asked Taleb about his view of the\nmarket. He responded that he thought there was a high probability that the market would go up slightly over the next\nweek. Pressed further, he assigned a 70% probability to the up move. Someone in the meeting then noted that Taleb\nwas short a large quantity of S&P 500 futures\u2014a bet that the market would go down\u2014seemingly in contrast to his\n\u201cbullish\u201d outlook. Taleb then explained his position in expected value terms. He clarified his thought process with the\nfollowing table:\nEvent\nProbability\nOutcome\nExpected value\nMarket goes up\n70%\n+1%\n+0.7%\nMarket goes down\n30%\n-10%\n-3.0%\nTotal\n100%\n-2.3%\nIn this case, the most probable outcome is that the market goes up. But the expected value is negative, because the\noutcomes are asymmetric.4 Now think about it in terms of stocks. Stocks are sometimes priced for perfection. Even if\nthe company makes or slightly exceeds its numbers the majority of the time (frequency), the price doesn\u2019t rise much.\nBut if the company misses its numbers, the downside to the shares is dramatic. The satisfactory result has a high\nfrequency, but the expected value is negative.\nNow consider the downtrodden stock. The majority of the time it disappoints, nudging the stock somewhat lower. But\na positive result leads to a sharp upside move. Here, the probability favors a poor result, but the expected value is\nfavorable.\nInvestors must constantly look past frequencies and consider expected value. As it turns out, this is how the best\nperformers think in all probabilistic fields. Yet in many ways it is unnatural: investors want their stocks to go up, not\ndown. Indeed, the main practical result of prospect theory is that investors tend to sell their winners too early\n(satisfying the desire to be right) and hold their losers too long (in the hope that they don\u2019t have to take a loss). We\nnow turn to three leading practitioners in separate probabilistic fields: investing, pari-mutuel betting, and black jack.\nFrom OTC to OTB\nWarren Buffett, undoubtedly one of the 20th century\u2019s best investors, says that smarts and talent are like a motor\u2019s\nhorsepower, but that the motor\u2019s output depends on rationality. \u201cA lot of people start out with a 400-horsepower\nmotor but only get 100 horsepower of output,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better to have a 200-horsepower motor and get it all\ninto output.\u201d5 And one of the keys is to consider all investment opportunities in terms of expected value. As Buffett\u2019s\npartner Charlie Munger notes, \u201cone of the advantages of a fellow like Buffett is that he automatically thinks in terms\nof decision trees.\u201d6 Says Buffett, \u201cTake the probability of loss times the amount of possible loss from the probability\nof gain times the amount of possible gain. That is what we\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s imperfect, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s all\nabout.\u201d7\nNaturally, coming up with likely outcomes and appropriate probabilities is not an easy task. But the discipline of the\nprocess compels an investor to think through how various changes in expectations for value triggers\u2014sales, costs,\nand investments\u2014affect shareholder value, as well as the likelihood of various outcomes. Such an exercise also\nhelps overcome the risk aversion pitfall.8\nThe expected value mindset is by no means limited to investing. A recently published book, Bet with the Best, offers\nvarious strategies for pari-mutuel bettors. Steven Crist, CEO, editor and publisher of Daily Racing Form, shows the\nreturn on investment, including the track\u2019s take, of a hypothetical race with four horses. To summarize the lesson, he\nwrites, \u201cThe point of this exercise is to illustrate that even a horse with a very high likelihood of winning can be either\na very good or a very bad bet, and that the difference between the two is determined by only one thing: the odds.\u201d\nSo a horse with a 50% probability of winning can be either a good or bad bet based on the payoff, and the same\n"

He is saying, in plain words, it is not the frequency of winning that matters, but the\nfrequency times the magnitude of the payoff.9\nCrist also solicits a confession from his readers, \u201cNow ask yourself: Do you really think this way when you\u2019re\nhandicapping? Or do you find horses you \u2018like\u2019 and hope for the best on price? Most honest players admit they follow\nthe latter path.\u201d Replace the word \u201chandicapping\u201d with \u201cinvesting\u201d and \u201chorses\u201d with \u201cstocks\u201d and Crist could be\ntalking about the stock market.\nYet another domain where expected value thinking is pertinent is black jack, as Edward Thorp\u2019s best-selling book,\nBeat the Dealer, shows. In black jack, the payoffs are set, and the player\u2019s principal task is to assess the probability\nof drawing a favorable hand. Thorp showed how to count cards in order to identify when the probabilities of a\nwinning hand tilt in player\u2019s favor. When the odds favor the player, the ideal strategy is to increase the bet (effectively\nincreasing the payout). Thorp notes that even under ideal circumstances, favorable situations only arise 9.8% of the\ntime; the house has the advantage the other 90.2%.10\nSo we see that the leading thinkers in these three domains\u2014all probabilistic exercises\u2014converge on the same\napproach. We also know that in these activities, the vast majority of the participants don\u2019t think through expected\nvalue as explicitly as they should. That we are risk adverse and avoid losses compounds the challenge for stock\ninvestors, because we shun situations where the probability of upside may be low but the expected value is\nattractive.\nA Useful Analogy\nLong-term success in any of these probabilistic exercises shares some common features.\nWe summarize four of them:\n\u2022 \nFocus. Professional gamblers do not play a multitude of games\u2014they don\u2019t stroll into a casino and play a\nlittle black jack, a little craps, a spend a little time on the slot machine. They focus on a specific game and\nlearn the ins and outs. Similarly, most investors must define a circle of competence\u2014areas of relative\nexpertise. Seeking a competitive edge across a spectrum of industries and companies is a challenge, to say\nthe least. Most great investors stick to their circle of competence.\n\u2022 \nLots of situations. Players of probabilistic games must examine lots of situations, because the \u201cmarket\u201d price\nis usually pretty accurate. Investors, too, must evaluate lots of situations and gather lots of information. For\nexample, the very successful president and CEO of Geico\u2019s capital operations, Lou Simpson, tries to read\n5-8 hours a day, and trades very infrequently.\n\u2022 \nLimited opportunities. As Thorp notes in Beat the Dealer, even when you know what you\u2019re doing and play\nunder ideal circumstances, the odds still favor you less than 10% of the time. And rarely does anyone play\nunder ideal circumstances. The message for investors is even when you are competent, favorable\nsituations\u2014where you have a clear-cut variant perception vis-\u00e0-vis the market\u2014don\u2019t appear very often.\n\u2022 \nAnte. In the casino, you must bet every time to play. Ideally, you can bet a small amount when the odds are\npoor and a large sum when the odds are favorable, but you must ante to play the game. In investing, on the\nother hand, you need not participate when you perceive the expected value as unattractive, and you can bet\naggressively when a situation appears attractive (within the constraints of an investment policy, naturally). In\nthis way, investing is much more favorable than other games of probability.\nConstantly thinking in expected value terms requires discipline and is somewhat unnatural. But the leading thinkers\nand practitioners from somewhat varied fields have converged on the same formula: focus not on the frequency of\ncorrectness, but on the magnitude of correctness.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager or co-manager of a public\noffering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies mentioned.\n1 We are not equating investing to gambling. In fact, long-term investing is really the opposite of gambling. In gambling, the more you play the\ngreater the odds that you lose. In investing, the longer you invest, the greater the odds that you generate positive returns.\n2 Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, \u201cProspect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk\u201d Econometrica, 47: 263-291 (1979).\n3 Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Fooled By Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Markets and in Life (New York: Texere, 2001), pp. 87-88.\n4 Taleb points out that well-known investor Jim Rogers avoids options because \u201c90 percent of all options expire as losses.\u201d Rogers is confusing\nfrequency with how much money is made on average.\n5 Brent Schlender, \u201cThe Bill & Warren Show,\u201d Fortune (July 20, 1998).\n6 Charlie Munger, \u201cA Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom As It Relates to Investment Management & Business\u201d Outstanding Investor Digest,\nMay 5, 1995, p. 50.\n7 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, 1989.\n8 Alfred Rappaport and Michael J.
