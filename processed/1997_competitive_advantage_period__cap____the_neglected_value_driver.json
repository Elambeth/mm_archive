      "text": "Frontiers of Finance\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nIn 1991, a Goldman Sachs limited partner, Barrie Wigmore, released a study that\nattempted to determine what factors drove the stock market\u2019s above-average re-\nturns in the decade of the 1980s. After carefully accounting for earnings growth,\ninterest rate declines, M&A activity and analysts\u2019 \u201ctoo-rosy\u201d forecasts, it appeared\na full 38% of the shareholder value created in the 1980s remained unexplained.\nDubbed the \u201cX\u201d factor, this mysterious driver of value left Wigmore and the Wall\nStreet Journal1, which published a feature article on the study, at a loss. Given\noverwhelming evidence of well-functioning capital markets, it appears completely\nunsatisfactory to attribute such a large component of share price performance to\nsome unidentifiable and seemingly inexplicable force2.\nFortunately, we believe there is an answer to this problem. However, to understand\nthe solution there must be a recognition that share prices are not set by capitalizing\naccounting-based earnings, which are at best flawed and at worst substantially\nmisleading. It appears that this was precisely the paradigm under which both Mr.\nWigmore and the Wall Street Journal were operating. The focus must be on the\neconomic drivers of a business, which can be defined as cash flow (cash-in versus\ncash-out), risk (and appropriate demanded return) and what we have dubbed\n\u201ccompetitive advantage period\u201d\u2014 CAP\u2014 or how long returns above the cost of\ncapital will be earned. CAP is also known as \u201cvalue growth duration\u201d3 and \u201cT\u201d4,5\nin the economic literature. CAP is also similar in concept to \u201cfade rate.\u201d\nIn this context, we believe Mr. Wigmore\u2019s \u201cX\u201d factor can be explained by the\nmarket\u2019s extension of expectations for above-cost-of-capital returns. As Mr.\nWigmore\u2019s analysis suggests, the length and relative change of CAP can have\na substantial impact on the value of a business and the market overall. For\nexample, the revision in expectations of Corporate America\u2019s ability to generate\nreturns above its cost of capital is a powerful indicator that investors believed\nthat America was more competitive at the end of the 1980s than it was entering\nthe decade. This conclusion was later supported by economic analysis.\nIt should be noted that in a well-functioning capital market all assets, including\nbonds and real estate, are valued using similar economic parameters. In the case of\nbonds, for example, the coupon rate (or cash flow) is contractually set, as is the\nmaturity. The bond price is set so that the expected return of the security is com-\nmensurate with its perceived risk. Likewise for most commercial real estate trans-\nactions6. At the end of the day, the process of investing returns to the analysis of\ncash flow, risk and time horizon. Since these drivers are not contractually set for\nequity securities, they are by definition expectational and, in most cases, dynamic.\nRemarkably, in spite of CAP\u2019s importance in the analytical process\u2014 which we\nwill attempt to demonstrate below\u2014 it remains one of the most neglected compo-\nnents of valuation. This lack of focus appears attributable to two main factors.\nFirst, the vast majority of market participants attempt to understand valuation and\nsubsequent stock price changes using an accounting-based formula, which gener-\nally defines value as a price/earnings multiple times earnings. Thus CAP is rarely\nexplicitly addressed, even though most empirical evidence suggests that the stock\nmarket deems cash flow to be more important than earnings, holds true to the\nrisk/reward relationship over time, and recognizes cash flows many years into the\nfuture7.\nWhy CAP Matters\n"

As a\nresult, investor communication is geared more toward internal company-based ex-\npectations rather than external market-based expectations. If the determination of\nstock prices is approached with an economically sound model, as we argue it\nshould be, the concept of CAP becomes immediately relevant, as we show below.\nCompetitive advantage period (CAP) is the time during which a company is ex-\npected to generate returns on incremental investment that exceed its cost of capital.\nEconomic theory suggests that competitive forces will drive returns down to the\ncost of capital over time (and perhaps below it for a period). Said differently, if a\ncompany earns above market required returns, it will attract competitors that will\naccept lower returns, eventually driving industry returns lower.\nThe notion of CAP has been around for some time; nonetheless, not much attention\nhas been paid to it in the valuation literature. The concept of CAP was formalized\nby Miller & Modigliani through their seminal work on valuation (1961). The\nM&M equation can be summarized as follows:\nValue = NOPAT + I(R-WACC)CAP\nValue = WACC  +(WACC) (1+WACC)\nwhere\nNOPAT =  net operating profit after tax\nWACC =  weighted average cost of capital\nI\n=  annualized new investment in working and fixed capital\nR\n=  rate of return on invested capital\nCAP\n=  competitive advantage period\nRearranged, the formula reads:\nCAP = (Value*WACC-NOPAT)(1+WACC)\nCAP =         I(R-WACC)\nThese formulas have some shortcomings that make them limiting in practice, but they\ndemonstrate, with clarity, how CAP can be conceptualized in the valuation process.\nA company\u2019s CAP is determined by a multitude of factors, both internal and external.\nOn a company-specific basis, considerations such as industry structure, the company\u2019s\ncompetitive position within that industry, and management strategies define the\nlength of CAP. The structured competitive analysis framework set out by Michael\nPorter can be particularly useful in this assessment8. Important external factors\ninclude government regulations and antitrust policies. CAP can also reflect inves-\ntor psychology through implied optimism/pessimism regarding a firm\u2019s prospects.\nWe believe that the key determinants of CAP can be largely captured by a handful\nof drivers. The first is a company\u2019s current return on invested capital. Generally\nspeaking, higher ROIC businesses within an industry are the best positioned com-\npetitively (reflecting scale economies, entry barriers and management execution).\nAs a result, it is often costlier and/or more time consuming for competitors to\nwrest competitive advantage away from high-return companies. Second is the rate\nof industry change. High returns in a rapidly changing sector (e.g., technology)\nare unlikely to be valued as generously as high returns in a more prosaic industry\n(e.g., beverages). The final driver is barriers to entry. High barriers to entry\u2014 or in\nsome businesses, \u201clock-in\u201d and increasing returns\u2014 are central to appreciating the\nsustainability of high returns on invested capital.\nCAP Defined\n"

That is, if an implied CAP is \u201ctoo short\u201d (too long) for the shares of a\ngiven company, astute investors will purchase (sell) those shares in an attempt to\ngenerate excess returns. Accordingly, changes in CAP are a critical driver in\nvaluation. Experience shows that CAPs are rarely static, and are usually in the\nprocess of expanding or shrinking.9\nGraphically, CAP can be represented by the accompanying two figures. In Figure\n1, the Y axis represents expected return spread (return on invested capital less the\ncost of capital) while the X axis is time. As time goes on, competitive forces drive\nreturns to a level equal to the cost of capital. The shaded area under the curve,\ntherefore, is what the market is trying to determine, and is the basis for P/E ratios,\ncash flow multiples and various rate of return measures. Figure 1 presents the\ntheoretical decay in excess returns as competitors are drawn into the industry.\nFigure 2, on the other hand, is how we believe the market actually works. Although\nvalue creation may occur beyond the CAP, as shown in this figure, risk-averse\ninvestors are only willing to go so far into the future. This notion has implications\nthat will be explored below.\nFigure 1\nTheoretical Decay in Excess Returns\nFigure 2\nHow the Market Works\nA careful look at these figures also reveals that they capture the three traditional\ncomponents of a discounted cash flow model.

The terminal value is where the \u201cCAP\u201d line intersects the\nX axis.\nFrom a practical standpoint, we find that the discounted cash flow analysis done\nby most analysts and strategic planners has a forecast period, or CAP, that is too\nshort and a terminal value that incorporates too much of the overall value. As a\nresult, the calculation of value becomes highly sensitive to the implicit growth as-\nsumptions beyond the forecast horizon that are imbedded in the terminal value. For\nexample, it is not unusual for 75% or more of a company\u2019s value to be attributable\nto a terminal value. In contrast, a DCF model incorporating CAP usually has a\nlonger forecast horizon, all growth assumptions are explicitly stated, and the ter-\nminal value is usually a modest contributor to overall value.\nIn a theoretical sense, the allocation of intrinsic value among the components is not\nimportant; in real life, valuations vary widely as a result of different CAPs and\nmethods employed to calculate terminal value.11 To paraphrase John Maynard\nKeynes, we would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.\nWe often hear that it is completely unreasonable to forecast beyond two or three\nyears, because \u201canything beyond that is guessing\u201d12. This logic misses the point,\nwhich is that the market often does impound cash flows beyond the near term. Ac-\ncordingly, an analyst must gain an understanding of why cash flows are recognized\nfor so long and whether or not those cash flow expectations are reasonable.13\nOur discussion so far has dwelled on those companies that generate returns above\nthe cost of capital, a universe which represents roughly one-third of corporate\nAmerica (another one-third are estimated to be value-neutral with the last third\nvalue destroying).14 Two points are noteworthy about value-neutral and value-\ndestroying companies. First, the CAP for a value-neutral company is of little con-\nsequence, since returns are assumed to be equal to the cost of capital (i.e., the sec-\nond part of the M&M formula has little or no value). Applying such performance\nto either Figure 1 or Figure 2 would show little area under the curve, thus having a\nminimal impact on value. Second, value-destroying companies are often tricky to\nmodel, because many of them appear to have an \u201cimbedded option\u201d for better per-\nformance. That is, the market is willing to pay more for these companies than one\nwould otherwise expect due to the possibility that the company will restructure,\nand hence generate better returns in the future.15\nThe CAP for the U.S. stock market, as a whole, is estimated to be between 10 and\n15 years. However, within that aggregate, individual company CAPs can vary\nfrom 0-2 years to over 20 years. As a general rule, companies with low multiples\ntend to have shorter CAPs (interestingly, these low multiples are accompanied by\nabove-market-average earnings growth in some industries). Alternatively, compa-\nnies with high multiples typically have long CAPs. For example, companies like\nMicrosoft and Coca-Cola have CAPs well in excess of 20 years, demonstrating\ntheir perceived market dominance, the sustainability of high returns, and the mar-\nket\u2019s willingness to take the long view. If a substantial percentage of the value of a\ncompany can be attributed to cash flows beyond a few years, it is difficult to argue\npersuasively that the market is short-term-oriented. In turn, it follows that the fore-\ncast periods used in most valuation models are not long enough.\nHow Long Are\nCAPs and How\nShould They Be\nDetermined?\n"

As noted earlier, the compo-\nnents of value are all expectational, and therefore must be considered relative to\none another and against the expectations for the business overall.\nThere are a number of ways of estimating CAP, but one of the most useful meth-\nods was developed by Al Rappaport16. We have chosen to borrow and slightly alter\nRappaport\u2019s name for the technique\u2014 market-implied duration\u2014 and call it mar-\nket-implied CAP (MICAP). Determination of the MICAP has a few steps. First,\nthe analyst needs a proxy for unbiased market expectations as the key input into a\ndiscounted cash flow model (we use Value Line long-term estimates). Since, by\ndefinition, there is no value creation assumed after CAP, the model uses a perpe-\ntuity assumption (NOPATCAP/WACC) for the terminal value. Next, the length of\nthe forecast horizon is stretched as many years as necessary to achieve the current\nstock price. This period is the company\u2019s MICAP.\nScrutiny of the MICAP determination process would correctly identify it as a cir-\ncular exercise. That is, if a stock price increases without changes in cash flow\nexpectations and/or risk, the MICAP will necessarily expand. This in no way\nweakens CAP\u2019s value as an analytical tool, however, as the next section will ex-\nplain. In fact, we believe this tight link with valuation highlights the power of in-\ncluding CAP as a key tool in the analytic toolbag.\nWe believe that MICAPs can be key to the analytic process. For instance, a cal-\nculated MICAP can be compared to previous MICAPs for the same company, an\naverage MICAP for the industry (if possible and appropriate), and the company\u2019s\nhistorical cash-on-cash return on invested capital. We have done this analysis for\nthe packaged food industry over the past few years, and have consistently derived\nindustry MICAPs in the range of 14-16 years17.\nThe first use for CAP in security analysis is to help translate the market expecta-\ntions impounded in a share price into value drivers that are easy to understand\nand assess. The value of any asset can be expressed with a limited number of\nvariables\u2014 in particular, cash flow, risk and CAP. As such, the analyst can hold\nconstant one of the three main drivers and consider what the security price is im-\nplying about the other two. For example, consider the shares of the Kellogg\nCompany. With the shares at about $70 and a weighted average cost of capital of\n11%, the market is impounding roughly 10% cash flow growth18 for about 15\nyears. If the analyst lowers his or her projection of CAP to 10 years, the cash flow\ngrowth rate would have to rise just to equal the current share price. Similarly, if\nthe CAP were deemed to be 20 years, the implied cash flow growth rate would\ndecline to a rate under 10%.\nTable 1\nRelation of FCF, WACC and CAP for Kellogg\nEstimated\nEstimated\nCAP Equity Value\nScenario\nFCF Growth\nWACC\n(Years)\nPer Share\nA\n10%\n11%\n15\n$70\nB\n>10\n11\n10\n70\nC\n<10\n11\n20\n70\nSource: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION.\nHow Can CAP Be\nUsed for Security\nAnalysis?\n"

Rappaport uses an analogy of a high jumper. The analyst has a feeling for\nthe future performance of the company\u2014 how \u201chigh\u201d the business can jump\u2014  and\nusing CAP in analysis can help determine how \u201chigh\u201d the bar is set. If the antici-\npated performance of the business is greater (worse) than the implied performance,\nthe stock is a buy (sell).\nA second important concept is that if the CAP for a value-creating company re-\nmains constant, an investor can expect to generate excess returns over time19.\nNote that a constant CAP is contrary to economic theory, but it may be achieved\nthrough outstanding management (i.e., resource allocation, acquisitions). To illus-\ntrate this point, refer to Figure 3. Imagine going from year 0 to year 1. As the\nlength of CAP remains unchanged, a year of value creation is added, and the past\nyear of value creation is lopped off. As the investor purchased the shares expecting\nabove-cost-of-capital returns for the implied period, the additional year of value\ncreation represents a \u201cbonus,\u201d or excess returns.\nIt appears that Warren Buffett has used this concept for years in his investment\nprocess. He buys businesses with \u201chigh returns on capital\u201d (returns in excess of\nthe cost of capital) that have \u201cdeep and wide moats\u201d (sustainable CAPs) and holds\nthem \u201cforever\u201d (hoping that the CAPs stay constant). Although this technique seems\nfairly straightforward, finding businesses with enduring CAPs is not simple.20\nWitness IBM. Although the company is reemerging as a formidable competitor,\nthe company\u2019s CAP shortened dramatically in the early 1990s as the result of\nchanges within the industry and several management missteps. Once considered\nimpenetrable, the company came to be viewed as a weakened giant, and its\nMICAP shortened as a consequence.\nFigure 3\nCAP Remaining Constant Over Time\nFinally, understanding the concept of CAP helps reconcile relationships that ap-\npear counterintuitive when viewed through the accounting-based lens. For exam-\nple, a relatively slow-growth, high-return company in a stable industry may well\ncommand a higher valuation (i.e., higher P/E, price/book value, etc.) than a fast-\ngrowing, high-return company in rapidly changing industry. While part of such a\nmultiple discrepancy could be explained by different risk profiles, we believe that\nthe market implied CAPs would also be justifiably different for the two companies.\nWithout CAP, we believe that it would be difficult to explain the differences in\nvaluation between the companies. Accounting-based valuation techniques are not\nhelpful in resolving these disparities.\nReturns\nWACC\n0\n1\nshaded area = excess returns\n"

Said differently, the tech-\nniques employed by most successful money managers\u2014 no matter how they are\ncharacterized\u2014 collapse into a model that is rooted in the drivers of cash flow, risk\nand CAP.\nThe essence of growth investing, it appears, is to purchase stocks of companies\nwith high returns, and stable or expanding CAPs. We would note that CAP is un-\nlikely to expand if the rate of return on incremental investment is declining sharply\nor is below the cost of capital. Value investing, on the other hand, appears to either\nseek out those value-creating companies that have particularly short CAPs for rea-\nsons that can be identified as transitory, or to identify businesses with improving\nreturns, and hence potential for widening CAPs. Investing that focuses solely on\nstatistically cheap companies often leaves portfolio managers with a number of\nvalue neutral or value-destroying companies that show little potential to improve\ntheir performance.\nIt is generally accepted that discounted cash flow analysis, and therefore the use of\nCAP, is not helpful in valuing fast-growing companies, such as technology busi-\nnesses. These companies, it is asserted, are \u201cearnings driven.\u201d We will argue that\nin fact \u201cearnings-driven\u201d companies are implicitly valued by the market based on\ncash flow projections and that CAP is a very important consideration in the analy-\nsis of these businesses.\nMicrosoft has been one of the most successful companies in Corporate America\nover the past ten years. The company has grown sales from under $200 million in\nfiscal 1986 (the year it went public) to $8.7 billion in the most recent fiscal year.\nThe company has created a phenomenal amount of shareholder value in the proc-\ness. When the company went public on March 13, 1986, it had a market capitali-\nzation of $519 million. The company\u2019s market value was approximately $100\nbillion at year-end 1996. Microsoft created roughly $100 billion in shareholder\nvalue over a decade.\nHow is this possible? We argue that approximately two-thirds of the increase in\nshareholder value was the result of a dramatic lengthening of the company\u2019s im-\nplied CAP. We calculate that Microsoft\u2019s CAP was eight to ten years the day it\nwent public\u2014 using then-prevailing consensus estimates. Interestingly, the actual\nCAP at the time proved to be only about three years, as the company\u2019s actual re-\nsults far exceeded expectations.\nWe calculate that Microsoft\u2019s current implied CAP is 17-20 years. If the company\nstill had an implied CAP of eight to ten years, the current market value would be\nroughly $33 billion. Therefore, we argue that two-thirds of the company\u2019s current\nvaluation is the result of an expansion in its implied CAP. Without the concept\nof CAP, we believe that most of Microsoft\u2019s massive value creation cannot be\nexplained.\nValue versus Growth\nInvesting\u2014 CAP\u2019s\nImportance\nCan CAP Work for\nGrowth Companies?\n"

During calendar 1996, the stock increased\napproximately 135% as investor expectations for the company\u2019s growth and prof-\nitability increased dramatically. Interestingly, once again we think that CAP played\na critical role in the company\u2019s reevaluation. In May 1996, Intel announced that it\nwould not lower pricing in the fall of 1996 as it had in each of the prior years. This\nannouncement proved to be a watershed event as it implied that\u2014 as the result of\nlower production costs and economies of scale\u2014 earnings and returns on invested\ncapital (ROIC) would expand. From the time of this announcement to the end of\nthe year, the stock doubled.\nAgain, we ask the question: How can a stock with such a large capitalization\n(roughly $120 billion at year-end) better than double in one year? We estimate that\nIntel\u2019s market implied CAP was roughly five years at the beginning of 1996, but\nexpanded to about nine years by the end of the year. Expectations of net operating\nprofit after tax (NOPAT) increased during the year as a result of the strategic\nchange in pricing strategy, but we calculate that 65% of the increase in market\ncapitalization\u2014 $45 billion\u2014 was related to a lengthening in the implied CAP.\nOnce again, the dramatic change in market value cannot be explained without\nCAP.\nWe have also used CAP as a heuristic in our analysis. An example is the semicon-\nductor industry in late 1995. At the time, the sector had produced excellent appre-\nciation for three years. Expectations about the future of the industry were generally\nupbeat. However, there was growing evidence that significant new capacity would\nbegin to come onstream during the second half of 1996, negatively affecting the\nprofitability of the industry and causing the industry ROIC to fall. These concerns\nnotwithstanding, industry capacity at the time remained constrained, allowing the\nleading vendors to post impressive financial results.\nHowever, the leading semiconductor stocks were beset with peculiar behavior. The\ncompanies reported record earnings\u2014 easily beating consensus expectations\u2014 but\ntheir stocks failed to rise. In fact, the stocks started to show considerable weakness\n(some dropped as much as 50% in the ensuing three to six months) in the face of\nthe impressive financial performance. How could this have happened? As earnings\nestimates continued to rise, a valuation based solely on price/earnings multiples\nwas clearly of no help.\nWe assert that the market-implied CAPs shortened because of concerns surround-\ning the impending capacity additions. Future expectations for ROICs were effec-\ntively being cut by investors, even as short-term earnings forecasts were rising.\nOnce again, CAP proved to be a critical component in the valuation process.\nIn an effort to demonstrate how changing CAPs can affect stock prices\u2014 and ex-\nplain the \u201cX\u201d factor\u2014 we studied a handful of companies within the packaged food\nindustry in the September 1982 to August 1989 period. As our goal was to identify\napproximate CAPs in each period, we used Value Line long-term forecasts as a\nproxy for consensus cash flows and used then-current risk-free rates, betas and\nequity risk premiums to estimate expectations for the cost of capital. These drivers,\nwhen considered next to the stock price, allowed for an estimate of CAP.

We believe that CAP can play an important\nrole in linking valuation theory and practice.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION has, within the last three years, served as a manager or\nco-manager of a public offering of securities for Coca-Cola, IBM, and Kellogg, and makes a primary market in issues of\nIntel and Microsoft.
