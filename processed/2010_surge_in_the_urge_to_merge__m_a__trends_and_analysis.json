Historically, \nupswings in deal activity have coincided with improvements in the economy and the stock market. \nExhibit 1 shows the relationship between deal volume and the price level of the S&P 500 Index \nover the past 15 years. The strong rally in equities off the March 2009 lows, sharply improved \ncredit conditions, solid non-financial corporate balance sheets, and companies seeking to \nenhance their strategic positions all point to more deals. Notably, research shows that companies \nmaking acquisitions in the early part of the cycle deliver better returns to their shareholders, on \naverage, than those that act toward the end of the cycle. 2 \n \nExhibit 1: M&A Is Heavily Procyclical \nGlobal M&A Volume and S&P 500 Index\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\nVolume ($Trillions)\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n1,800\nS&P 500 Index\n1995 1996\n1997 1998\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\n2004 2005\n2006 2007 2008\n2009\n \nSource: Bloomberg, Reuters, LMCM estimates; data through 2009. \n \nAfter reaching an all-time high in 2007, M&A activity has tumbled in the last year and a half, \nreflecting the financial and economic tumult. While 2008\u2019s deal volume looks respectable given \nthe stock market\u2019s sharp decline, the deals were heavily skewed toward the first half of the year. \nAnnounced activity was weak in 2009, but the fourth quarter was the strongest of the year, \nreflecting the improvement in equity and credit markets. For all of 2009, global M&A volume was \nroughly $2 trillion, about half of the average level over the past five years. 3 \n \nDuring the deep recession of the past two years, falling earnings and limited access to capital \nmade executives more risk averse. As a result, firms slashed expenses, squeezed their balance \nsheets, and reined in growth initiatives. This has allowed companies to generate healthy free \ncash flows and to sustain strong financial positions. While consumer and government debt may \nbe of concern, the balance sheets of many companies are solid. As the recovery gains \nmomentum, companies are again setting their eyes on growth.  \n \nIn recent months, several high-profile M&A deals have been announced. The most notable is \nExxon Mobil\u2019s $31 billion offer for XTO Energy, a leading acquirer and producer of oil and gas. \nKraft\u2019s $16.8 billion bid for Cadbury, a global confectionery producer, is also a large potential \ntransaction. (Hershey has also expressed interest in Cadbury.) While not a clean M&A deal, \nGeneral Electric has agreed to sell its majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast in a complex \ntransaction valuing the unit at about $30 billion. 4 \n \nM&A activity tends to rise and fall along with the stock market, and almost every company is \neither involved in a deal, or affected by one, at some point.

Mergers and acquisitions play a large role in shaping competitive landscapes and can \nhave a large impact on corporate value.  \n \nMany companies and investors do not have a firm grasp on how M&A deals create or destroy \nshareholder value. Companies do deals for a host of reasons, including the pursuit of growth, \ndiversification of their businesses, or to consolidate an industry. And companies often feel \ncompelled to do a deal simply because other companies in their industry are doing them. \nGenerally, companies, investment bankers, and investors assume that deals that add to earnings \nper share are virtuous. But for an acquirer there is ultimately only one test of a deal\u2019s merits: \nwhether it creates shareholder value. Since investors have a strong incentive to properly evaluate \na deal\u2019s economic virtue, the stock price change following an announcement is often an excellent \nbarometer of a deal\u2019s merit. On this point, the evidence is damning.  \n \nResearch shows roughly two-thirds of M&A transactions destroy shareholder value for the \nacquiring companies. In addition, the market\u2019s initial reaction to a deal is a reasonably unbiased \npredictor of long-term value creation. Mark Sirower and Sumit Sahni, consultants versed in M&A \neconomics, looked at the persistence of returns for deals that the market initially deemed \nfavorable or unfavorable (see Exhibit 2). While the initial response wasn\u2019t always the final say, \nabout one-half of deals with positive initial reactions stayed favorable one year later, while roughly \ntwo-thirds of deals with initial negative reactions remained unfavorable. 6 \n \nExhibit 2: Initial Reaction Speaks Volumes \nStock Reaction\nInitial positive\n# of Deals\nAnnouncement \nReturn\nOne-Year \nReturn\nPremium\n33.1%\n5.6%\nPersistent positive\n25.8%\n103\n52\n5.7%\n4.9%\n30.7%\nFull sample\n302\n-4.1%\n-4.3%\n35.7%\nInitial negative\n199\n-9.2%\n-9.0%\n38.4%\nPersistent negative\n133\n-10.3%\n-24.9%\n40.5%\n \nSource: Mark L.

Used with permission. \n \nThe basic reason that most M&A deals fail to create value for buyers is that acquirers tend to pay \ntoo much for targets. A host of factors might explain this tendency, including an overly optimistic \nassessment of market potential, overestimation of synergies, poor due diligence, and hubris. But \nwhile deals are harmful for the shareholders of acquirers on average, some buyers do create \nvalue. Acquirers can increase their chance of success by paying low premiums and executing on \noperational improvement. 7 The research points to another reason some acquirers succeed: good \ntiming.  \n \nA recent study by three professors of management showed that companies that do deals early in \nan acquisition wave generally enjoy share-price rises, while those that buy later tend to suffer \nstock-price declines. Acquirers at the beginning of a wave see their shares increase more than \nfour percent above what would be expected, based on past performance and market trends, over \nthe three weeks following the M&A announcement (see Exhibit 3.) Buyers acting roughly two-\nthirds through the wave see average declines of approximately three percent. Returns actually \nimprove somewhat later in the wave, but are still vastly below those of the early-movers. 8 \n \n"

The sample included over 3,000 companies in a wide range of \nindustries from 1984 through 2004. All returns were adjusted for market factors. \n \nThere are several benefits to acting early in a cycle, including choosing from a greater pool of \npotential targets and the ability to buy assets cheaply. Naturally, the larger the number of \npotential acquisition candidates, the more likely it is that a buyer can find a suitable target. \nFurther, firms that move early can generally do deals at cheaper prices\u2014usually against a \nbackground of economic growth\u2014than companies that act late in the cycle. Finally, benefits to \nmoving early are most pronounced for industries that are growing and stable. \n \nUnderperformance for late movers is generally the result of taking strategic action based on the \nprevious action of other firms. While early movers can scan the landscape for the best targets, \nlate movers act less rationally and with greater haste, often leading them to acquire suboptimal \ntargets at elevated prices. Bandwagon pressures motivate the late movers to focus on social \ncues. As a result, they assume other companies have superior information and plunge into deals \nwithout fully considering the strategic implications.  \n \nBandwagon pressures also explain why returns improve late in the wave. The pressures subside \nas the M&A boom simmers out, allowing firms to complete more rational assessments of \nacquisition targets and their values. Even so, the latest movers still generate shareholders returns \nthat lag those made by early movers. 9 Finally, the form of financing plays a role in determining \nshareholder returns for acquirers later in the cycle. Companies that finance their deals primarily \nwith cash see a smaller decline in their shares than companies that use equity. \n \nSetting the Stage \n \nThere are two types of acquirers: strategic and financial. Strategic buyers are companies that use \nM&A as a tool to implement corporate objectives. The most common rationales for doing deals \ninclude industry capacity reduction, product or market line extension, geographic rollup, industry \nconvergence, and M&A as research and development. 10 Strategic buyers generally assume that \nthey can realize significant operational synergies, which justifies the premium they pay for their \ntargets.  \n"

      "text": " \nPage 5 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nFinancial buyers are typically private equity firms that acquire companies, business units, or \nassets and seek to improve their operating performance. The substantial use of debt\u2014private \nequity firms typically use $3-4 dollars of debt for every $1 of equity they contribute\u2014allows them \nto enhance their cash-on-cash returns. Further, there is a perception that private equity firms, less \nsusceptible to pressure from the public markets, can make more optimal capital allocation \ndecisions. (While I acknowledge this perception, I strongly disagree that public companies are \nhamstrung with their capital allocation decisions.)  \n \nCompanies generally pursue strategic deals in order to expand their core strengths. This may \ninvolve plans to extend their product or geographic scope. Recent instances of this horizontal \nexpansion include Exxon and XTO, Kraft and Cadbury, Stanley Works and Black & Decker, and \nDisney and Marvel. Consider Kraft\u2019s pursuit of Cadbury. With many of its traditional businesses \ngrowing slowly, Kraft seeks to bolster its organic growth through a purchase that offers similar \nproducts, but with much broader geographic reach. 11 \n \nWhile horizontal expansion may be the most popular rationale for doing a deal, there has been a \nnotable increase in deals based on vertical integration. A vertically integrated company controls a \nproduct or service throughout the value chain, from raw materials to the end product. In recent \ndecades the trend has been toward more specialization, as companies increasingly focused on \none part of the value chain. In the last two years\u2014perhaps spurred by the economic downturn\u2014\nsome prominent companies have done deals to become more vertically integrated. These include \nOracle and Sun Microsystems, PepsiCo and Pepsi Bottling Group, and Live Nation and \nTicketmaster. 12 \n \nOne factor slowing the pace of deals is that banks have been hesitant to fund them. In the U.S., \nbank loans for M&A fell sharply in 2009 to approximately $100 billion, about one-third of 2008\u2019s \nvolume and only one-sixth of the volume of 2007.13 After a brutal period in 2008 and early 2009, \nthere are encouraging signs in the credit markets. Deal financing is picking up, interest rates are \nfalling, credit spreads are narrowing, and bond issuance is at record-highs. \n \nFor instance, banks offered nearly $30 billion in loans to fund acquisitions or leveraged buyouts in \nthe month of November 2009, according to Dealogic, exceeding the total of the previous seven \nmonths combined. In addition, the cost of debt is falling rapidly. To illustrate, three- and six-month \nLIBOR\u2014widely used reference rates for borrowing\u2014have moderated from extremely high levels \nin 2008 (see Exhibit 4, left panel). Credit spreads, which reflect the cost of corporate borrowing \nabove the risk-free rate, have receded sharply for all major fixed income products (Exhibit 4, right \npanel).  \n \nExhibit 4: Improvement in Credit Markets \n \nSource: Left: Bloomberg; Right: Barclays; Data through 2009. \n \nHistorical Spreads\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nJune '07\nDecember '07\nJune '08\nDecember '08\nJune '09\nDecember '09\nIndex Value\nHigh-Yield\nGlobal Emerging Markets\nInvestment Grade\nAgency MBS\n3- and 6-Month LIBOR\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nJun-08\nAug-08\nOct-08\nDec-08\nFeb-09\nApr-09\nJun-09\nAug-09\nOct-09\nDec-09\nRate (%)\n6-month LIBOR\n3-month LIBOR\n"

      "text": " \nPage 6 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nAlong with the falling cost of debt, we have also seen a major increase in bond issuance. U.S. \ncorporate bond issuance hit an annual record of $1.2 trillion in 2009, just ahead of the issuance in \n2007 and up nearly 34 percent compared to 2008. 14 Much of this increase is the result of latent \ndemand that built up during the credit freeze in 2008. Government initiatives and low interest \nrates also helped.  \n \nImprovement in the credit markets is encouraging, but banks are not likely to return to pre-crisis \nmode any time soon. Even if the volume of loans recovers, lenders are likely to be more \nconservative on the terms in the future than they were in the past. This might include, for \nexample, insisting on a lower ratio of debt to the company\u2019s operating cash flow or as a \npercentage of total capitalization. Banks remain fearful that another market downturn will leave \nthem with vulnerable debt instruments. Also, banks are operating under the scrutiny of tighter \ncapital requirements, limiting their ability to expand M&A financing. 15 \n \nThese more conservative lending standards have hit the financial buyers especially hard. Private \nequity firms have historically financed buyouts with a ratio of anywhere from 60 to 90 percent debt \nto total capital. 16 During the golden age of 2002-07, investors poured record amounts into the \nprivate equity industry and bankers accommodated deal activity by relaxing standards on credit. \nThe financial crisis changed all that. Investors are now hesitant to invest with private equity firms, \neither because they\u2019re worried about capital calls or because they\u2019ve simply lost faith in the \nindustry. 17  \n \nSome of the largest institutional investors have already begun to cut back on their investments in \nprivate equity. For example, California Public Employees' Retirement System, the biggest \npension plan in the U.S., has reduced its allocation to private equity by more than 60 percent. 18 \nIn addition, over 40 percent of the largest university endowments are currently above their target \nallocations to private equity, suggesting they are also likely to reduce their investments in the \nfuture. 19 These factors have led to the virtual disappearance of private equity deals. Based on \ntrends through the first half of 2009, we estimate private equity M&A to be about $70 billion in \n2009, or 3-4 percent of total deals, much lower than the 15 percent average over the past decade \n(see Exhibit 5). 20 \n \nExhibit 5: Global M&A Volume \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\nVolume ($Trillions)\nPrivate Equity\nCorporate\n \nSource: Bloomberg, Reuters, LMCM estimates.

      "text": " \nPage 7 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nDespite the challenges, several factors suggest private equity M&A could soon be back. The \nindustry currently has roughly $500 billion in capital waiting to be invested, the largest amount in \nhistory. Assuming leverage at a 3-to-1 ratio to equity, this cash hoard represents $2 trillion in \npurchasing power, roughly 20 percent of the market capitalization of the S&P 500. In addition, \nprivate equity firms such as TPG, Blackstone, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are beginning to exit \npast investments. 21 These exits generate cash to disperse to investors and bode well for new \nrounds of fundraising. The sharp contraction in credit spreads provides another reason to expect \na pickup in leveraged buyout (LBO) activity. Over the past decade, LBO activity has been much \ngreater when credit spreads were tight. 22 \n \nPrivate equity may also benefit from an improvement in the market for collateralized loan \nobligations (CLOs), a critical source of financing for LBOs. These specialist funds, which pool \nloans and divide them into securities of varying risk, bought large amounts of LBO loans during \nthe prior M&A boom. In the first half of 2007, CLOs financed nearly two-thirds of the loans \nbacking LBOs. But after peaking at about $100 billion in 2006 and 2007, sales of CLOs virtually \ndisappeared. However, with market conditions improving and the sharp increase in the value of \nleveraged loans, many industry observers expect to see CLOs make a modest comeback over \nthe next year. 23 \n \nFor the foreseeable future, private equity deals will likely be smaller, and will include more upfront \ncash. Lower amounts of leverage may reduce returns, as the use of leverage has accounted for \nbetween one-quarter to one-third of returns. Transaction fees of about 1 to 2 percent will come \nunder pressure as well, as fees this high are hard to justify in an environment of lower expected \nreturns. 24 \n \nImplications for Investors \n \nResurgent M&A activity is by no means inevitable, but the evidence strongly points toward a \nreversal of the 2008-2009 decline. Should deal volume pick up, investors need to be prepared to \nassess these transactions properly. Investors should ask three critical questions when companies \nannounce a deal: \n \n1. Does the deal have material economic consequences for shareholders of the buying and \nselling companies? \n2. Is the buyer sending signals by choosing to pay for the deal with stock instead of cash? \n3. What is the stock market\u2019s likely reaction? \n \nMateriality \n \nThe first question investors must answer is whether or not the deal is likely to have a material \nimpact on shareholder value. Shareholder value at risk\u2014SVAR\u00ae\u2014measures the potential risk to \nshareholders of the acquiring company in the event that synergies do not materialize. SVAR \nprovides an immediate and accurate assessment of how much a deal is likely to affect acquiring-\ncompany shareholders. 25 \n \nSince SVAR is a percentage measure of the acquirer\u2019s potential downside, it quantifies the extent \nto which a company is betting the firm on the success of a deal. Low SVARs suggest limited \nupside or downside for the acquirer. High SVARs may portend larger-scale changes in the \nacquiring company\u2019s stock price. 26 \n \nSVAR is a function of two things: the premium an acquirer pledges and the deal\u2019s funding \nsource\u2014i.e., cash, stock, or some combination. For a cash deal, the SVAR is simply the premium \ndivided by the market capitalization of the acquirer. In a stock-for-stock deal, the SVAR is the \npremium divided by the combined market capitalizations of the acquirer and target (including the \nimplied premium).  \n"

The SVAR is higher in fixed-value stock deals than in fixed-share deals because acquiring \nshareholders bear all the pre-closing risk.

If the market perceives that the buyer is overpaying, it will drive the buyer\u2019s price down, \nreducing the acquisition value proportionately.  \n \nIn cash and fixed-value deals, target company shareholders have no risk (except deal-failure \nrisk). In fixed-value share deals, the buyer must completely absorb any fall in its price following \nthe announcement to assure that the bid value remains intact.

As such, a buyer using cash is signaling to the market that it truly expects \nthe deal to work. Managers who doubt whether a deal will achieve the required synergies are \nbetter off hedging their bets by issuing stock, thereby limiting the risk (and reward) their \nshareholders assume. \n \nThe relatively poor reception to stock deals is also consistent with the hypothesis that managers \nissue stock when they believe that their stock is overvalued. Issuing stock is dilutive for current \nshareholders and indicates that management does not believe its stock is undervalued. 29 \nHowever, investors cannot solely rely on a deal\u2019s funding as an indicator of its value-creation \npotential. An acquirer may have to issue stock because it does not have sufficient cash or debt \ncapacity to fund a very attractive investment. We suggest only that the form of payment often \nprovides an important signal about management\u2019s views of their business and their convictions \nsurrounding a deal\u2019s likely success. \n \nValue Creation \n \nInvestors can assess a deal\u2019s value creation potential in two parts, one largely quantitative and \nthe other mostly qualitative. The first part deals strictly with the deal economics and measures \nvalue creation in an M&A deal with the following formula: \n \nValue change = present value of the synergies \u2013 acquisition premium \n \nInvestors can use this straightforward formula to anticipate the cumulative abnormal price \nchanges for both the buyer and the seller. Cumulative abnormal returns seek to isolate the impact \nof an announcement by measuring a company\u2019s stock price change after adjusting for market and \nindustry moves. Note that earnings per share play no role in this assessment. This approach is \nconsistent with the standard net present value rule, and it is an easy formula to apply.  \n \nTo state the obvious, the higher the premium a buyer pledges, the larger the synergy the \ncombined companies must generate to create value.

As this is a stock-for-stock deal, the SVAR is the premium divided by the combined \nmarket capitalization of Stanley Works and Black & Decker (including the implied premium).  \n \nThe SVAR is 8.7 percent ($615 million premium divided by $7,050 million, the combined market \ncapitalization of the two companies). Note that the SVAR for Stanley Works would have been \neven higher in an all-cash transaction, as the denominator would have excluded Black & Decker\u2019s \nmarket capitalization. Again, SVAR represents the potential downside to Stanley Works \nshareholders in the case that no synergies materialize.  \n \nNext, we calculate premium at risk for Black & Decker shareholders, which determines the \npercentage of the premium that is at risk for Black & Decker shareholders. If no synergies \nmaterialize, Black & Decker shareholders will receive the $3,465 million purchase price minus \n49.5 percent of the $615 million premium, or $3,160 million. In effect, Black & Decker \nshareholders would receive about one-half of the pledged premium in the case of no synergies.  \n \nWe can assess the value creation potential of the deal by looking at the deal economics. We \nbegin with the formula: \n \nValue change = present value of the synergies \u2013 acquisition premium.  \n \nSince we know the premium, the key to solving for the value change is a calculation of the \npresent value of the synergies. We can determine the present value of synergies by capitalizing \nthe after-tax value of the annual synergy target. In this case, there are three steps: \n \n1. Translate synergy from pretax to after-tax (($350 million * (1 \u2013 tax rate) = $227.5 million)) \n2. Capitalize the after-tax synergy by the cost of capital ($227.5 million/11% = $2,070 \nmillion) \n3. Subtract the $400 million one-time cost of achieving synergy ($2,070 million - $400 \nmillion = $1,670 million) \n \nSo the present value of the synergies is $1,670 million. Subtracting the premium of $615 million \nleaves us with total value creation of $1,055 million. With no further analysis, we know that the \nstocks of both companies will rise if the market believes the synergy numbers. \n \nA solid estimate of the value creation potential is useful for a couple of reasons. First, it allows for \na specific prediction of how the acquirer and target stocks will perform upon the deal\u2019s \nannouncement. Second, if the stocks behave differently than the model suggests, it allows you to \nreverse-engineer the market\u2019s expectations.  \n \nWith total value creation of about $1,055 million, how would we expect the stock market to react? \nSince the deal terms call for SWK and BDK shareholders to each own roughly one-half of the \nshares outstanding after the deal, we can split the value creation evenly between them. SWK \nshareholders should expect a price increase of approximately $6.65 per share ($525 million \ndivided by 79 million post-deal shares) while BDK shareholders should expect an increase of \nroughly $18 per share (the $10 premium plus $525 million divided by 77 million shares, or \n$16.80).  \n \nWe can compare these expectations to the post-announcement stock price changes to see the \nextent to which the market believes the expected synergies will be realized. Shares of both \ncompanies rose after the announcement, however not to the extent predicted by the model. This \ncould suggest the market considers the synergy estimates to be too high. But we also must bear \n"

If history is any guide, M&A activity tends to follow the \nstock market with a modest lag. The market\u2019s bounce off of the March 2009 lows, when \ncombined with more amenable credit market conditions, have set the tone for a \nresumption of active deal activity. \n \n\u2022 \nThe early bird gets the worm. Academic research strongly suggests that companies \ndoing deals early in the M&A cycle provide better returns for their shareholders than the \ncompanies that participate later. The reason is straightforward: early in the cycle there \nare more companies to choose from and the targets are cheap. As the cycle matures, \noptions dissolve and valuations rise. \n \n\u2022 \nUse economic, not accounting, measures to evaluate deals. While it stands to reason \nthat executives seek to create shareholder value with the deals they do, the evidence \nshows that most don\u2019t. It appears that executives (and investment bankers) miss the \nmark because they focus on accounting-based measures instead of considering the \nextent to which synergies can exceed the premium. This report provides a sound \napproach to valuing M&A deals. \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpecial thanks to Dan Callahan, who contributed substantially to all aspects of this report. \n"
