He regularly made small amounts of\nmoney trading on that theory. There was a flaw in his approach, however. If there is a\u2026tide...he\ncan be seriously hurt because he doesn\u2019t have a proper fail-safe mechanism.\u201d\nGeorge Soros\nSoros on Soros (1995)1\n\u201cIn statistical terms, I figure I have traded about 2 million contracts\u2026with an average profit of\n$70 per contract. This average profit is approximately 700 standard deviations away from\nrandomness, a departure that that would occur by chance alone about as frequently as the\nspare parts in an automotive salvage lot might spontaneously assemble themselves into a\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurant.\u201d\nVictor Niederhoffer\nThe Education of a Speculator (1997)2\n\u201cOn Wednesday Niederhoffer told investors in three hedge funds he runs that their stakes had\nbeen \u2018wiped out\u2019 Monday by losses that culminated from three days of falling stock prices and\nbig hits earlier this year in Thailand.\u201d\nDavid Henry\nUSA Today (October 30, 1997)\n\u201cMuch of the real world is controlled as much by the \u2018tails\u2019 of distributions as by means or\naverages: by the exceptional, not the mean; by the catastrophe, not the steady drip; by the very\nrich, not the \u2018middle class.\u2019 We need to free ourselves from \u2018average\u2019 thinking.\u201d\nPhilip Anderson\nNobel Prize Recipient, Physics\nSome Thoughts About Distribution in Economics 3\nExperience Versus Exposure\nIn his 2001 letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett distinguishes between experience and\nexposure. Although Buffett\u2019s comments are in the context of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s insurance\nbusiness, his point is valid for any exercise with subjective probabilities. Experience, of course,\nlooks to the past and considers the probability of future outcomes based on occurrence of\nhistorical events. Exposure, on the other hand, considers the likelihood\u2014and potential risk\u2014of\nan event that history (especially recent history) may not reveal. Buffett argues that in 2001 the\ninsurance industry assumed huge terrorism risk without commensurate premium because it was\nfocused on experience, not exposure.\nInvestors, too, must discern between experience and exposure. The high-profile failures of Long\nTerm Capital Management and Victor Niederhoffer give witness to this point. Remarkably,\nhowever, standard finance theory does not easily accommodate extreme events. Financial\neconomists generally assume that stock price changes are random, akin to the motion of pollen\nin water as molecules bombard it.4\nMichael J.

      "text": "Page 2\nIn a triumph of modeling convenience over empirical results, finance theory treats prices changes as independent,\nidentically distributed variables and generally assumes that the distribution of returns is normal, or lognormal. The\nvirtue of these assumptions is that investors can use probability calculus to understand the distribution\u2019s mean and\nvariance, and can therefore anticipate various percentage price changes with statistical accuracy. The good news\nis that these assumptions are reasonable for the most part. The bad news, as physicist Phil Anderson notes\nabove, is that the tails of the distribution often control the world.\nTell Tail\nNormal distributions are the bedrock of finance, including the random walk, capital asset pricing, value-at-risk, and\nBlack-Scholes models. Value-at-risk (VaR) models, for example, attempt to quantify how much loss a portfolio may\nsuffer with a given probability. While there are various forms of VaR models, a basic version relies on standard\ndeviation as a measure of risk. Given a normal distribution, it is relatively straightforward to measure standard\ndeviation, and hence risk. However, if price changes are not normally distributed, standard deviation can be a very\nmisleading proxy for risk.5\nIn fact the research, some done as long as 40 years ago, shows that price changes do not follow a normal\ndistribution. Figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of S&P 500 daily returns from January 1979 to March 2002\nand a normal distribution derived from the data. Figure 2 highlights the difference between the actual returns and\nthe normal distribution. Analysis of different asset classes and time horizons yield similar results. 6 The figures\nshow that:\n\u2022 \nSmall changes appear more frequently than the normal distribution predicts.\n\u2022 \nThere are less medium-sized changes than the model implies (roughly 0.5 to 2.0 standard deviations).\n\u2022 \nThere are fatter tails than what the standard model suggests. This means that there are a greater-\nthan-expected number of large changes.\nFigure 1: Frequency Distribution of the S&P 500 Daily Returns (1979-2002)\nFrequency Distribution of S&P 500 Daily Returns\nJanuary 1, 1979 - March 22, 2002\n0.0%\n1.0%\n2.0%\n3.0%\n4.0%\n5.0%\n6.0%\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nStandard Deviation\nFrequency\n"

These extreme value changes happen considerably more\nfrequently than the standard model suggests, and can have a substantial influence on portfolio performance\u2014\nespecially for leveraged portfolios. For example, during the October 1987 crash, which we excluded from our\nfigures for presentation purposes, the S&P 500 plummeted over 20%, a change that is 19 standard deviations from\nthe mean. Roger Lowenstein notes:\n\u201cEconomists later figured that, on the basis of the market\u2019s historical volatility, had the market\nbeen open every day since the creation of the Universe, the odds would still have been against\nits falling that much in a single day. In fact, had the life of the Universe been repeated one billion\ntimes, such a crash would still have been theoretically \u2018unlikely\u2019.\u201d 7\nThe pattern of many small events and few large events is not unique to asset prices. Indeed it is a signature of\nsystems in the state of \u201cself-organized criticality.\u201d Self-organization is the result of interaction between individual\nagents (in this case investors) and requires no leadership. A critical state is one where small perturbations can\nlead to events of many types. Self-organized criticality marks systems as varied as earthquakes, extinction events,\nand traffic jams.8\nIs there a mechanism that can help explain these episodic lunges? We think so. As we have noted in previous\nreports, markets tend to function well when a sufficient number of diverse investors interact.9 Conversely, markets\ntend to become fragile when this diversity breaks down and investors act in a similar way (this can also result from\nsome investors withdrawing). A burgeoning literature on herding addresses this phenomenon. Herding is when a\nlarge group of investors make the same choice based on the observations of others, independent of the own\nknowledge. Information cascades, another good illustration of a self-organized critical system, are closely linked to\nherding.10\nWhat Fat Tails Mean for Investors\nO.K. Big changes in prices appear more frequently than they are supposed to. What does this mean for investors\nfrom a practical standpoint? We believe there are a few important implications:\n\u2022 \nCause and effect thinking. One of the essential features of self-organized critical systems is that the size of\nthe perturbation and resulting event may not be linearly linked. Sometimes small-scale inputs can lead to\nlarge-scale events. This dashes the hope of finding causes for all effects. For example, in a widely cited\n1989 paper, Cutler, Poterba, and Summers review the 50 largest post-war moves in the S&P 500 Index\nand the \u201ccauses\u201d, as reported by the New York Times the subsequent day. They summarize:\n\u201cOn most of the sizable return days\u2026the information that the press cites as the cause of the market move\nis not particularly important. Press reports on subsequent days also fail to reveal any convincing accounts\nof why future profits or discount rates might have changed.\u201d 11\n"

In contrast, nonlinearity is endogenous to self-organized\ncritical systems like the stock market. Investors must bear in mind that finance theory stylizes the\nreal world data. That the academic and investment community so frequently talk about events five or\nmore standard deviations from the mean should be a sufficient indication that the widely used\nstatistical measures are inappropriate for the markets.\n\u2022 \nPortfolio construction. Investors that design portfolios using standard statistical measures may\nunderstate risk (experience versus exposure). This concern is especially pronounced for portfolios\nthat use leverage to enhance returns. Many of the most spectacular failures in the hedge fund world\nhave been the direct result of fat tail events. Investors need to take these events into consideration\nwhen constructing portfolios.\nA useful means to navigate a fat-tailed world is to first measure the current expectations underlying an asset\nprice, and then contemplate various ranges of value outcomes and their associated probabilities. This\nprocess allows investors to give some weight to potential fat tail events.12\nStandard finance theory has advanced our understanding of markets immensely. But some of the theory\u2019s\nfoundational assumptions are not borne out by market facts. Investors must be aware of the discrepancies\nbetween the theory and reality and adjust their thinking (and portfolios) accordingly.\nN.B.: CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION may have, within the last three years, served as a manager or co-manager of\na public offering of securities for or makes a primary market in issues of any or all of the companies mentioned.\n_____________________________\n1 George Soros, Soros on Soros (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1995), 17.\n2 Victor Niederhoffer, The Education of a Speculator (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), ix.\n3 Philip W.
