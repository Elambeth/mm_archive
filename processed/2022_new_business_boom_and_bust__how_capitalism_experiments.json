Take the acquisition of \nlanguage as an example. Normal children effortlessly acquire the \nlanguage spoken around them without special instruction. Before \nthey can learn to read, kids add a new word to their vocabulary \nevery couple of hours that they are awake. By the time they \ngraduate from high school, Americans know about 60,000 words \nor phrases, or roughly 3 times the number of words in the oeuvre \nof William Shakespeare.1 \nLearning about the environment is crucial to survival. A child must \ndevelop an effective neural network to do so. Nature\u2019s solution to \nthe problem needs to be robust, inexpensive, and efficient. But the \napproach is not intuitive, especially to those who perceive that most \nsolutions are the product of design.2 \nNeurons and synapses are elemental components in your body\u2019s \nneural network. Neurons are cells in the nervous system that \nconnect and communicate with other cells. Synapses provide the \nstructure that allows the neurons to communicate with one another. \nYour neurons are the nodes and your synapses are the \nconnections in the neural network that is you. The challenge is \nfiguring out how to build a network that allows you to speak your \nnative language fluently and to understand it effortlessly, along with \na range of other essential skills. \nExhibit 1 shows the solution that evolution found. The number of \nneurons does not change dramatically throughout life.3 What does \nchange is the number of synaptic connections between the \nneurons. While the timing is different for various brain functions, \nthe pattern is the same: the brain creates a huge number of \nsynaptic connections and then reinforces the ones that are used \nand prunes the ones that are not used. To put some figures to it, at \nthe peak a toddler has about 1 quadrillion synaptic connections \n(one thousand trillion), or about 15,000 per neuron.4 In the pruning \nphase, a child loses about 200 billion connections a day on the way \nto having about one-half as many by the age of 10. It\u2019s \u201cuse it or \nlose it.\u201d \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J. Mauboussin \nmichael.mauboussin@morganstanley.com \n \nDan Callahan, CFA \ndan.callahan1@morganstanley.com \n"

Thompson and Charles A. Nelson, \u201cDevelopmental Science and the Media: Early Brain \nDevelopment,\u201d American Psychologist, Vol. 56, No. 1, January 2001, 5-15. \nThis process of overproduction and pruning appears wasteful, especially considering that the brain uses about \n20 percent of the body\u2019s energy. But scientists have shown that this approach creates a network of neurons that \nfunctions well in a wide range of potential environments.5 In effect, the swell in synaptic connections prepares \nthe child for lots of possible paths, and the pruning matches the mind with the circumstances that prevail in the \nchild\u2019s world.    \nBurgeoning industries commonly follow the same pattern as they develop. The increase in synaptic connections \nis analogous to new companies, each entering the industry with a novel approach or technology to address the \nbusiness challenge. The marketplace is the environment, which \u201cselects\u201d the products or services that best fit \nthe industry\u2019s needs. The decrease in connections is analogous to the exit of companies.  \nWe discuss this pattern for companies, describe why investors should care, and offer some current examples of \nwhere this pattern of entry and exit is playing out. \nPruning for Performance and the Product Life Cycle \nLet\u2019s start with some classic examples of this pattern. Exhibit 2 shows the development of the U.S. automobile \nand personal computer (PC) industries. The auto industry started around 1895, saw a massive rate of net entry \nuntil about 1910, and then saw a substantial rate of net exit through 1941.6 The PC industry started in the mid-\n1970s, climbed to a peak number of companies in 1987, and saw a decline in total companies through the mid-\n1990s.7 Researchers have documented a similar outline of industry evolution for dozens of industries.8 \n \n \n \n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 10 11 12 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nNumber of Synapses\nMonths\nYears\n//\nAge\n"

This pattern of boom and bust \nis known as the product life cycle. Klepper identified and described six regularities in this evolutionary process:9 \n1. As an industry is born it is common for the number of entrants to rise and then fall over time. The total \nnumber of competitors is ultimately small.10 \n2. The output of the industry continues to grow even as the number of producers falls from the peak.  \n3. The market shares of the competitors are unstable at first, but eventually stabilize.11 \n4. The diversity of versions of competing products coincides with the growth of entrants. The number of \ninnovations peaks in the growth phase and falls thereafter. \n5. Product innovation is the focus early in the cycle. Process innovation is the focus late in the cycle. \n6. When the number of entrants is on the upswing, most product innovations come from new entrants.  \nKlepper, along with Michael Gort, an economist, examined 46 industries and measured the average time it took \nto pass through the various stages, including the growth in net entry, low to zero net entry near the peak of \ncompetition, and negative net entry.12 The early phases last longer on average than the late ones. Further, we \ncan observe that the diffusion of new innovations is happening faster today than it did in the past. \nIn his book, Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation, James Utterback, an emeritus professor of management at \nMIT, describes three phases in this recurring pattern.13  \nThe first is the fluid phase where there is a lot of experimentation with product design and the nature of the \nbusiness model. The outcome is unclear, and the emphasis is on the performance of the various competing \nproducts. Companies tend to be led by entrepreneurs. This phase is akin to the rise in synaptic connections \nwhere a wide range of outcomes is possible.  \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n1885\n1889\n1893\n1897\n1901\n1905\n1909\n1913\n1917\n1921\n1925\n1929\n1933\n1937\n1941\nNumber of Companies\nAutomobiles\nEntries\nTotal\nExits\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n1974\n1976\n1978\n1980\n1982\n1984\n1986\n1988\n1990\n1992\n1994\nNumber of Companies\nPersonal Computers\nEntries\nTotal\nExits\n"

All rights reserved. \n5780827 Exp. 6/30/2024 \n4 \n \nThe second is the transitional phase where the market has settled on a product design and the focus shifts to \nprocess innovation. Investors use the term \u201cproduct-market fit\u201d to describe when the product coalesces with the \nneeds of the market. In effect, the customers prune subpar alternatives and reinforce the product that best \nserves their needs. Consideration of complementary assets is also important because new companies are also \nembedded in a business ecosystem. Autos with internal combustion engines need roads, gas stations, and \nmechanics that can fix them. The emphasis is on how best to bring the product to market given the environment. \nFinally, there is the specific phase where the pace of product and process innovation is slow because most \ncompetitors have adopted the industry\u2019s best practices. Companies here may be susceptible to disruptive \ninnovation, where new business models, a form of process innovation, allow for entrants to compete for specific \nsegments of the market.14 \nNeural development and the product life cycle follow a similar pattern because they are effectively addressing \nthe same task of discovering what is useful in a new environment. The solution in both cases is to try out a lot \nof alternatives and winnow down what does not work.  \nInvestor Takeaways from the Pruning Process \nUnderstanding this pattern of innovation can help investors in a number of ways. To begin, it is very useful to \nunderstand which phase an industry is in. One straightforward way to do this is by measuring the number of \nentries, exits, and total number of firms in the industry. This fits with the first of Klepper\u2019s stylized facts. Failure \nrates are high in the early phase and drop substantially once the process is largely complete. Exits are the result \nof going out of business, which is bad for shareholders, or of being acquired by another company, which is often \nnot as bad.  \nInvestors should also be aware of the interplay between financial and technology markets.15 Here\u2019s the basic \nstory. Financial capital tends to flow in as it becomes clear that a potential new industry is emerging. In many \ncases, the companies associated with the innovation receive inflows that lift asset prices to levels that are \nunsupported by the fundamentals. Financial capital then flees, leaving asset prices that are fair to undervalued. \nFinally, the financial and technological markets come into alignment.  \nIn the fluid phase, investments in companies have payoffs similar to options. A financial option is the right but \nnot the obligation to invest in a stock at a set price within a predetermined time. About one third of options expire \nworthless. In the aggregate, these investments in the early phase appear to generate a return similar to, or \nbelow, that of the broader market.16  \nBut similar to the venture capital industry, the distribution of the returns to shareholders is heavily skewed, with \na small number of companies generating outsized gains and the majority losing money for shareholders.17  \nImportantly, the influx of financial capital is essential to developing the industry because it funds experimentation. \nIt appears inefficient in retrospect once the market has sorted the winners and losers. But this evolutionary \nprocess is similar to what happens with the synaptic connections: the generation of options is followed by \nselection for what is most appropriate for the environment.     \nAnother investor takeaway relates to the assessment of competitive advantage. Market share stability is one of \nthe ways to test for competitive advantage.18 The premise is that if an industry\u2019s market shares are highly \nunstable then it is unlikely that one or more companies within the industry have a sustainable competitive \n"

Further, an expanding list of companies that have any share of the market suggests limited barriers \nto entry. A thoughtful assessment of barriers to entry is central to a proper analysis of competitive advantage.19   \nThe degree of market stability tends to mirror the stages of industry development, consistent with the regularities \nthat Klepper identified. Market shares are very unstable in the fluid phase. For example, General Motors, Ford, \nand Chrysler swapped rankings in market share in the U.S. automobile industry multiple times between 1925-\n1935 (see exhibit 3). Market shares settle down in the transitional phase, after the market has separated the \nearly winners from the losers.20  \nA fourth takeaway for investors is that the industry\u2019s output continues to increase even as the total number of \ncompanies decreases. This means that a smaller number of companies are taking a greater share of a larger \nmarket. Exhibit 4 shows this pattern for the U.S. automobile and PC industries. \nExhibit 3: Market Share for the U.S. Automobile Industry, 1911-1937 \n \nSource: \u201cReport on Motor Vehicle Industry,\u201d Federal Trade Commission, June 5, 1939 and Counterpoint Global. \nExhibit 4: Fall in Companies and Rise in Production in the U.S. Automobile and PC Industries \n \n \nSource: Auto companies: Wikipedia contributors (see exhibit 2); Auto production: NBER Macrohistory: I.

As a result, the unit price of the good \noften declines during this period.21 A lower price promotes additional adoption. This can be the sweet spot for \ninvestors, as the market has selected the survivors and growth is in its early phases.    \nPattern recognition is important for investors but often tricky to implement because humans tend to see patterns \neven where none exist.22 This process of overproduction and pruning has played out in billions of brains and \ndozens of industries. And it is happening today.  \nThe Beginning of Boom and Bust \nWe currently see this pattern in a few areas. One example is the electric vehicle market (see exhibit 5). We \ncount a little more than 500 companies in the industry when we include automobile and truck manufacturers \n(both new entrants and traditional manufacturers of vehicles with internal combustion engines diversifying into \nthe electric vehicle industry), makers of batteries and other key components such as powertrains, and companies \nthat provide technology for charging. While the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the entry and exit data, \nwe appear to be in a phase where new entrants exceed exits. \nExhibit 5: Selected Electric Vehicle Companies, 1986-2021 \n \nSource: PitchBook and Counterpoint Global. \nCryptocurrencies also share this form, albeit at an earlier phase than electric vehicles. A cryptocurrency is a \ndigital token that is created and maintained through a computer network via blockchain technology and therefore \ndoes not operate through a centralized authority. Cryptocurrencies are one component of the infrastructure \nnecessary to support decentralized finance, which combines open-source building blocks to reduce friction and \ncentralized control in the traditional financial system. \nExhibit 6 shows that there were just under 9,000 cryptocurrencies at year-end 2021 and that the rate of entry \nremains robust. To date, more than 2,400 cryptocurrencies have exited, either as the result of failure or fraud. \nThe vast majority of the existing cryptocurrencies are likely to fail as well. \nIt is also worth noting that two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, represent almost two-thirds of the total \nmarket value of all cryptocurrencies and that the market capitalizations of cryptocurrencies follow a power law.23 \nBitcoin largely operates now as a store of value and, to a lesser degree, as a payment network. Ethereum \nextends the Bitcoin applications as it allows for smart contracts, which reside on the Ethereum blockchain and \ndefine interactions.24    \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n1986\n1991\n1996\n2001\n2006\n2011\n2016\n2021\nNumber of Companies\nEntries\nTotal\nExits\n"

Much of the capital that will flow into these sectors will earn substandard returns but will \nfacilitate experimentation and product innovation.  \nAs the market sorts the winners from the losers, there should be substantial opportunity for the companies that \nachieve product-market fit. While difficult to handicap, some companies will rise to the top and flourish amid the \nshakeout. \nConclusion \nAn engineer confronted with a problem in a novel environment would be tempted to fashion a specific solution. \nBut studies of the pattern of synaptic connections of children, as well as the emergence of industries, show that \nthe overproduction of options and pruning of those that are not useful is a tried-and-true way to solve the \nproblem.  \nThis pattern is particularly noteworthy in capitalistic economies because of the interaction between financial and \ntechnology markets. Capital flows are often very strong as a new industry develops. This money fuels vital \nexperimentation, but since most ideas fail the investments behind them fare poorly. Capital markets are generally \nless enamored with the industry when exits exceed entrants, but at that juncture fewer companies capture more \nmarket share of a growing industry.  \nInvestors are well served to understand this general pattern and to consider where it is in the process of playing \nout. Examples today include the markets for electric vehicles and cryptocurrencies. \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 10-12  \n \n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\n8,000\n9,000\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nNumber of Cryptocurrencies\nEntries\nTotal\nExits\n"
