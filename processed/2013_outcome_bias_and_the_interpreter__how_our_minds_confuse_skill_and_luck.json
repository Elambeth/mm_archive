      "text": "October 15, 2013  \n \nOutcome Bias and the Interpreter \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nHere is one quote from Monday morning\u2019s media: \n \n\u201cEach and every week we see bad coaching decisions in the NFL, but never, and I mean never, have I seen \none as dumb as the decision Patriots coach Bill Belichick made Sunday night against the Colts.  \n \nHis brain was more frozen than Ted Williams\u2019.\u201d1 \n \nNumerous press accounts echoed this sentiment. Here was the situation that created the stir. On the evening \nof November 15, 2009, the New England Patriots were leading the home team, the Indianapolis Colts, by the \nscore of 34-28. There were just over two minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots had the ball on their \nown 28 yard line, and it was fourth down with 2 yards to go.  \n \nBill Belichick, the head coach of the Patriots, had two choices. He could instruct his team to punt, which \nwould likely give the ball to the talented Colts around their own 35 yard line and force them to march \ndownfield to score the game-winning touchdown in limited time. \n \nOr Belichick could go for it on fourth down. A successful conversion would effectively win the game for the \nPatriots and hand the Colts their first loss of the season. But a failure to convert would turn the ball over to the \nColts at a very attractive position on the field, substantially increasing the probability that the Colts would score \nand win.     \n \nThe Patriots had faced a similar situation seven weeks earlier against the Atlanta Falcons. They went for it, \ngot the first down, and clinched the game. On this night, the Patriots went for it again and were ruled down \njust shy of the marker. Moments later, the Colts scored a touchdown. Final score: Colts 35, Patriots 34.  \n \nBelichick was unapologetic as he addressed his team the next day: \u201cMy decision there at the end was based \non what I felt was best for the football team and our best chance to win. I\u2019m just telling you I did what I \nthought was best. And it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d Later, he added, \u201cThe sign on the door when you walk out says \n\u2018ignore the noise.\u2019 That\u2019s the most important thing. Ignore the noise. I hope you believe it because it\u2019s the \ntruth. I\u2019ll always tell you the truth.\u201d2  \n \nDid Belichick make the correct decision? The sports analytics community quickly rendered its verdict, and the \nconsensus was that he did the right thing. Brian Burke at Advanced NFL Stats summed it up by saying, \u201cThe \nbetter decision would be to go for it, and by a good amount.\u201d While Burke\u2019s analysis relied on numerous \nassumptions, it would have been hard to assign credible probabilities that would have flipped the odds in favor \nof punting.3  \n \nIf Belichick indeed made the right decision from a statistical standpoint, why was he excoriated in the press? \nWe argue that the reason is something called outcome bias, which says that \u201cpeople take outcomes into \naccount in a way that is irrelevant to the true quality of the decision.\u201d4 Outcome bias is rife in the worlds of \nbusiness, investing, sports, and politics. We will discuss the mental processes that underlie outcome bias and \nwill finish with some ideas about how to cope with it. \n \nThat outcome bias is so widespread is not just an interesting psychological observation. It also encourages \npoor decisions. You might imagine the mental process of a coach who is less secure in his job than Belichick. \nThat coach would find the \u201csafe\u201d but inferior choice to punt the ball preferable precisely because it would \nshield him from the wrath of the fans, the press, and perhaps even the team\u2019s owners.  \n"

      "text": "October 15, 2013  \n \nOutcome Bias and the Interpreter \n3 \nEvery day, people who make good decisions with bad short-term outcomes risk losing their jobs. This might \ninclude the head of a studio in Hollywood who failed to deliver a blockbuster, a chief executive officer who \nmade a reasoned investment that soured, or a money manager with poor results for a quarter or two. The \ncareer risk in making better but bolder decisions can be too high for many professionals to handle. Most \nleaders punt.   \n \nOutcomes Dictate Assessments of Decision Quality \n \nOutcome bias only arises when certain conditions are in place. Consider two parties, the person making the \ndecision and the person judging the decision. If the judge knows nothing of the information that decision \nmaker had, it is reasonable to equate poor outcomes with poor decisions. The judge has nothing else to go on.  \n \nBut when the judge has access to the same information as the decision maker and still equates a good \noutcome with good skill and a bad outcome with bad skill, outcome bias is at work. The bias is especially \npronounced for decisions with outcomes that include a healthy dose of luck.  \n \nJonathan Baron and John Hershey, scholars of decision science, ran an experiment to show this bias. In one \nversion, the subjects of the experiment were the judges. They were told that a 25-year-old man won a prize \nand that the man was unmarried and held a steady job. The prize was a choice between winning $200 for \ncertain or an 80 percent chance of winning $300 and a 20 percent chance of winning nothing. The \nresearchers told the subjects that the man selected the gamble.      \n \nThe researchers then showed the subjects two different outcomes. In one the man won $300 and in the other \nhe won nothing. They then asked the subjects to rate the quality of the man\u2019s decision on a scale from 30 \n(clearly correct, the opposite decision would be unacceptable) to -30 (incorrect and inexcusable). Since the \njudges had the same information as the man making the decision, they should have rated the quality based \nsolely on the decision itself, irrespective of the outcome. But that\u2019s not what happened.  \n \nWhen the subjects were told that the man had won the money, they rated the quality of his decision a 7.5. \nWhen the researchers told the subjects that the man had earned nothing, they rated his decision a -6.5. (See \nExhibit 1.) These ratings are clear evidence that the outcomes deeply influenced how the subjects assessed \nthe decision. Somehow, the subjects didn\u2019t distinguish between two independent issues: the quality of the \ndecision and the outcome from the decision.5 \n \nExhibit 1: Outcome Bias Revealed in an Experiment \n \nSource: Jonathan Baron and John C.

      "text": "October 15, 2013  \n \nOutcome Bias and the Interpreter \n4 \nWe can examine the furor around Belichick\u2019s decision in this light. Even though the statistics on \u201cgoing for it\u201d \nwere widely available before the decision, most people assessing the quality of the decision did not have the \nnumbers at their fingertips. Had there been no information from any source, it would have been very difficult to \njudge the quality of the choice objectively. So while the criticism of Belichick\u2019s decision appears misplaced, it \nis at least understandable given that few knew what he did at the moment he decided.  \n \nBaron and Hershey\u2019s experiment is even more powerful, as it suggests that even those who have that \ninformation struggle to disentangle it from the outcome. How could judges place a different rating on the \nidentical decision given only a different outcome? We\u2019ll now explore why it\u2019s so hard to distinguish between \nthe quality of the process of making decisions and the outcomes that appear.    \n \nA Look Under the Hood: How the Interpreter Rules the Day \n \nMichael Gazzaniga is a neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who is best known for his \nfascinating study of split-brain patients. These are people who at one point suffered from debilitating epileptic \nseizures. A doctor observed that one of his patients got relief after he developed a tumor on his corpus \ncallosum, the bundle of nerves connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain.   \n \nSo for the first time in 1940, doctors started treating these patients by surgically severing the corpus callosum, \neffectively stunting communication between the brain\u2019s hemispheres. The treatment was very successful as \nthe number of seizures decreased sharply and the patients all reported feeling fine after the operation. But for \nour purpose, the fascinating part of this procedure is that it created an extraordinary experimental condition \nthat allowed neuroscientists to determine what happens in each of the hemispheres.6   \n \nOne of the most remarkable findings from this research is that there is a module in the left hemisphere that \nGazzaniga calls \u201cthe interpreter.\u201d This part of the brain takes any effect that it sees and creates, effortlessly \nand rapidly, a cause to explain it. The interpreter \u201ccontinually explains the world using inputs that it has from \nthe current cognitive state and cues from the surroundings\u201d and doesn\u2019t consider the source or completeness \nof the information. Further, the interpreter is \u201cdriven to infer cause and effect.\u201d It knows nothing of probability, \nrandomness, or luck.7 \n \nGazzaniga figured out the location and function of the interpreter through experiments with split-brain patients. \nHere\u2019s an example. The scientists showed the left hemisphere a picture of a bird\u2019s foot and the right \nhemisphere a picture of a snowy scene. Because the corpus callosum is cut, neither hemisphere has access \nto the image flashed to the other one.  \n \nThe researchers then asked the patient to point to an object that was consistent with the picture they saw. \nThe hand affiliated with the left hemisphere selected a chicken, a match with the bird\u2019s foot, and the hand \naffiliated with the right hemisphere picked a shovel\u2014again, the correct choice given the image of the snowy \nscene. The patients made these accurate choices with ease. But the left hemisphere, where the capacity for \nlanguage resides, now confronted discordant information. It could observe the hand pointing to the shovel, but \nhad no access to the image of the snowy scene.  \n \nThe researcher asked the patient why he was pointing at the shovel. The correct answer would have been, \u201cI \ndon\u2019t know.\u201d But the interpreter didn\u2019t miss a beat, informing the scientist that he needed a shovel to clean \nout the chicken shed.8 Note what\u2019s going on here. The interpreter sees an effect (pointing to the shovel) and \ncreates a story (a shovel to clean the shed) to explain the cause. More often than not, the story the interpreter \ntells is true and follows the facts closely. But the essential point is that facts do not constrain the interpreter. It \noperates even if it only gathers the gist of a situation. \n"

      "text": "October 15, 2013  \n \nOutcome Bias and the Interpreter \n5 \nGazzaniga and his colleagues ran another test, called the probability guessing experiment, to understand how \nthe left and right hemispheres operate. In this experiment, the subject sees lights that flash either at the top or \nthe bottom of the computer screen. The subject\u2019s objective is to guess whether the light will flash above or \nbelow the midpoint. The scientists set the flashes so that they appeared at the top 80 percent of the time.  \n \nResearchers have done a version of this experiment with pigeons, rats, and children under the age of four. \nThe scientists give the animal and young human subjects rewards for correct guesses. Each of them behaves \nas a \u201cmaximizer.\u201d Once they figure out that the flashes are predominantly on the top, they select the top every \ntime and are correct 80 percent of the time. They maximize their reward. \n \nBut humans older than four are pattern seekers, and try to determine the order in which the random lights \nflash. As a result, they answer correctly only about two-thirds of the time. Scientists call those who try to \nguess the pattern \u201cfrequency matchers.\u201d While frequency matchers recognize that 80 percent of the flashes \nare above the midpoint, they are not content to guess the top every time but rather attempt to discern a \npattern. \n \nWith split-brain patients, Gazzaniga could see where this tendency to search for patterns resides. When the \nresearchers presented the probability guessing experiment to the right hemisphere, they found that it was a \nmaximizer just as the pigeons, rats, and little kids were. But with the same experiment the left hemisphere \nacted as a frequency matcher. It is the part of your brain that is responsible for finding patterns.  \n \nWhere does all of this leave us? We know that when we see an outcome and don\u2019t know what information the \ndecision maker had, our minds assume that good outcomes are associated with good decisions and bad \noutcomes are linked to poor skill. Further, we know that there is a part of our brain that does this fluently and \nautomatically. The interpreter will come up with a correct story if it has the proper information. But it is willing \nto make up a story, imposing order on the world, even if it doesn\u2019t have all of the proper information. \nResearchers have isolated the function of the interpreter in split-brain patients, but it runs in all of our heads \nevery day. And this leads us to make poor decisions ourselves and to craft faulty assessments of the \njudgments of others.  \n \nLuck Throws the Interpreter for a Loop \n \nThe interpreter tends to be particularly poorly calibrated when randomness and luck play a large role in \ndetermining results. The interpreter sees the effect but has a difficult time seeing a clear-cut cause, so it has \nto infer some skill or other causal mechanism. \n \nA recent experiment shows just how hard it is for us to accept the role of randomness.9 The researchers \nseparated their subjects into two groups. Group A had 20 players and group B had 28. In phase I of the \nexperiment, members of group A were asked to call five coin tosses and received \u20ac2 for every correct call and \nnothing for a wrong call. Those in group B simply observed the action. \n \nThe researchers then asked six members of group A, representing a range of success rates from all correct \n(5-of-5) to all incorrect (0-of-5), to leave the room.  \n \nIn Phase II, the researchers told the members of group B that two players from group A, the individual who \ngot the most calls right and the individual who got the most wrong in Phase I, would engage in an additional \nround of calling five coin tosses. Group B members were given \u20ac10 and were told that the calls of one of the \nplayers would determine their payoff\u2014they would receive \u20ac4 for a correct call and lose \u20ac2 for an incorrect call. \n"

They could either stick with the \ndefault assignment, the bad coin toss caller, or offer to pay some amount of their \u20ac10 to switch to the student \nwho called the most right. At this point, the group B players indicated how much they would be willing to pay \nto switch.    \n \nThe subjects in this experiment were students of finance who were explicitly taught about randomness. Given \nthat the coin tosses were truly left to chance, the subjects had no basis to switch. This was especially true if \nthey had to pay a price to do so. Yet 82 percent of group B (23 of 28) provided a price representing their \nwillingness to pay to switch. The players in group B who switched stated an average price of almost \u20ac3 to \nswitch from a person who called none correct to one who called all five (see Exhibit 2).10  \n \nWe can interpret the result of this experiment as outcome bias.

      "text": "October 15, 2013  \n \nOutcome Bias and the Interpreter \n7 \nTake, for instance, the evidence that individual and institutional investors have a clear tendency to shed funds \nor asset classes that have done poorly and buy those that have done well. Individuals have such a proclivity to \nbuy what\u2019s hot that academics have a name for it: \u201cthe dumb money effect.\u201d This research shows that \nindividual investors, on average, would have earned one percentage point more in returns if they had simply \nstayed put with their prior investments versus switching to new ones. Similar to the subjects who were willing \nto pay to have access to the good coin toss caller, investors are willing to incur costs to switch to hot funds.11    \n \nInstitutional investors, despite their ostensibly greater sophistication, are not immune to the bias. Analysis of \nasset allocation decisions, both from one asset class to another and from one manager to another within an \nasset class, show that institutions generally fail to add value. The institutions buy products that underperform \nthe ones they sell. One estimate places the foregone value at $170 billion, a sizeable sum even considering \nthe trillions of assets under management.12   \n \nAnother example is the decision to hire a star from another company. Boris Groysberg, a professor of \norganizational behavior at Harvard Business School, has examined this topic in detail. One of his studies was \nof top-rated sell-side analysts, as determined by Institutional Investor, who switched from one firm to another. \nOutcome bias would suggest that the excellent performance of the analysts was perceived to be solely a \nreflection of their skill. That skill, as a result, should be portable to another company.  \n \nGroysberg found that the performance of analysts who switched firms \u201cplunged sharply.\u201d Successful analysts \nbenefit from the organization in which they work and likely a large dose of good luck. Neither of those \ntransfers from one firm to the next. This is the hiring version of the \u201cdumb money effect.\u201d13 \n \nHow to Keep the Interpreter in Check \n \nGiven the prevalence of outcome bias and the poor decisions that it spawns, the question is what to do about \nit. Here are two steps you can take to help keep the interpreter in check: \n \uf402\n Measure the amount of luck in the activity. There are few sure things in life. Most events only \nhappen with some probability. The first step is determining how much room there is for the interpreter to \nrun. Where there is randomness, there is ample opportunity for the interpreter to get into mischief. For \nrealms where causality is hard to pinpoint and experts are poor at predicting outcomes, the interpreter \nrequires close monitoring. In certain fields, there are reasonably precise methods for estimating the \nrelative contributions of skill and luck.14 \n \uf402\n Where there is luck, focus on the process. When skill exclusively determines results, outcomes \nalone are an accurate measure of skill. Think of the sprinter in a 100-meter dash or a concert pianist on \nstage. The link from cause to effect is clear, and there is no reason to worry about outcome bias. \n \nWhen luck contributes to results, you must consider the process by which the decision was made. While \na good process leads to the highest probability of good results over time, the link between process and \noutcome is loose in the short run. This is the realm where you must diligently fend off outcome bias. The \nresults should not color your assessment of the quality of the decision. Note that if you don\u2019t have full \naccess to the decision maker\u2019s process, your mind will associate poor results with poor skill. \n \nA related point is that you should not assume that good results are a reflection of a good process. This is \nan important topic in ethics. For instance, research shows that \u201cpeople blame others too harshly for \nmaking sensible decisions that have unlucky outcomes,\u201d and \u201cwe let ethically-questionable decisions slide \nfor a long time until they result in negative outcomes, even in cases in which such outcomes are easily \n"

A substantial amount of research shows \nthat it is difficult for auditors to remain objective if they are also engaged as a firm\u2019s consultant. A handful \nof high-profile failures, including Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco, revealed the downside of these conflicts. \nYet while these companies generated what appeared to be satisfactory outcomes, their processes were \nrarely questioned. \n \nOur minds are wondrous. The interpreter, in particular, is amazing at associating cause and effect.
