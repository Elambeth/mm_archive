Mauboussin\nmmauboussin@ lmcm.com\nLEGG MASON\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n \n \nDecember 20, 2007 \n \nFat Tails and Nonlinearity \n \nDiversity Breakdowns and Invisible Vulnerability \n \nFor he who is acquainted with the paths of nature, will more readily observe her \ndeviations; and, vice versa, he who has learned her deviations will be able more \naccurately to describe her paths. \n \nFrancis Bacon \nNovum Organum 1 \n \nThe Memo Went Out \n \nIf you are involved in financial markets, you have gotten the memo about fat tails \nby now. \n \nBut awareness of extreme events is not enough. Thoughtful investors must \nunderstand two interrelated aspects of the market. The first is the statistical \nproperties of price movements, including important deviations from the bell-shaped \ndistribution. Academics, risk managers, and quantitative investors have explored \nthis aspect extensively. Researchers recognized decades ago that the distribution \nof price changes includes fat tails. 2   \n \nThe second aspect, and one often overlooked or misunderstood, is the mechanism \nthat leads to the statistical imprint. Much of the work on the market\u2019s statistical \nproperties is divorced from the propagating mechanism, while traditional theories of \nmarket efficiency assume the mechanisms. 3 Crucially, understanding the \nmechanism provides insight into how and why markets fail.   \n \nOur focus here is on nonlinearity. Many complex systems, including markets, have \ncritical points where small incremental condition changes lead to large-scale \neffects. Researchers in both the physical and social sciences have known about \nthese critical points for a long time; so much so that terms like phase transition and \ntipping point have slipped into our day-to-day language. Still, critical points throw a \nmonkey wrench into our mostly linear cause-and-effect thinking. \n \nCritical points help explain our perpetual surprise at fat-tail events: We don\u2019t see \nthem coming because the state change is much greater than the perturbation \nsuggests. Water does not undergo a dramatic change as it drops from 35 to 33 \ndegrees Fahrenheit, but two degrees of additional cooling changes its state from \nliquid to solid. Likewise, large changes can occur in markets without visible \nmanifestation in asset price change, while small additional changes can flip the \nprice switch. \n \nCritical points are also important for proper counterfactual thinking. 4 For every \ncritical point we do see, how many were lurking but never triggered? Like water \ntemperature dropping to 33 degrees and again rising, there are likely many near-\nmisses in the markets that elude our detection. \n"

      "text": " \nPage 2 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nWe survey three ideas: black swans and why patterns set us up for surprise; the conditions for \ncrowds to be wise and the role of nonlinearity; and, finally, three examples of nonlinearity, \nincluding a physical system, an agent-based model, and a recent market dislocation. \n \nDon\u2019t Feed the Turkey \n \nNassim Taleb uses the black swan metaphor to help popularize the fat-tail idea. He defines a \nblack swan as an outlier event that has an extreme impact and that humans seek to explain after \nthe fact. Recent market turmoil fits the definition well. \n \nThe black swan reference reflects Karl Popper\u2019s criticism of induction. Popper\u2019s point is that to \nunderstand a phenomenon, we\u2019re better off focusing on falsification than on verification. Seeing \nlots of white swans doesn\u2019t prove the theory that all swans are white, but seeing one black swan \ndoes disprove it.  \n \nTaleb relates the story of a turkey that is fed 1,000 days in a row. 5 The feedings reinforce the \nturkey\u2019s sense of security and well-being, until one day before Thanksgiving an unexpected and \nuninvited bad event occurs. All of the turkey\u2019s experience and feedback is positive until fortune \ntakes a turn for the worse. Recent comments by a senior executive at one of the world\u2019s largest \nbanks evoke the turkey story: \u201cOur losses [from instruments based on U.S. subprime mortgages] \ngreatly exceeded the profits we made in this field over several years.\u201d 6   \n \nHere\u2019s the point: rising asset prices provide investors confirming evidence that their strategy is \ngood and everything is fine. This induction problem lulls investors into a sense of confidence, and \nsets the stage for the shock when events turn down. That nonlinearity causes sudden change \nonly adds to the confusion. \n \nRivets, Redundancy, and Diversity Breakdowns \n \nAs we and others have argued, investors should recognize the market as a complex adaptive \nsystem. Complex means there are lots of investors within the system. Adaptive means investors \nchange their decision rules in response to market conditions. And system means the whole is \ngreater than the sum of the parts\u2014prices emerge from the interaction of the investors within it. \nComplex adaptive systems are everywhere in natural and social systems. \n \nThe \"wisdom of crowds\" is a colloquial way of describing the market as a complex system. The \nwork on wisdom of crowds shows that when certain conditions are met\u2014diversity, aggregation, \nand incentives\u2014markets tend to be efficient. Conversely, when one or more of those conditions \nare violated, markets can and do become inefficient (i.e., price is no longer an unbiased reflection \nof value).  \n \nFor a host of social psychological and sociological reasons, diversity is the most likely condition to \nbe violated. Here, too, market observers have recognized the importance of diversity. 7 But what\u2019s \nessential to recognize is the relationship between diversity breakdowns and asset price \nperformance is nonlinear. Diversity can be on the decline as the asset price rises, which makes \nthe market fragile. Like a rubber band that\u2019s stretched, the tension builds and the inevitable \nsnapback is often painful.  \n \nConsidering the market as a complex adaptive system allows us to understand the mechanism by \nwhich prices are set. While many questions remain unanswered, we can look to the three \nconditions for guidance for how well the market is functioning. Further, we can see why most \nlarge market moves are internal to the system (endogenous) versus external factors imposed on \nthe market (exogenous). Our estimate is 80 percent of the market\u2019s largest moves in the past 60 \nyears are attributable to endogenous activity.  \n \n"

      "text": " \nPage 3 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nOne virtue of viewing the market as a complex adaptive system is that it allows us to study similar \nsystems in order to draw parallels. One example is the rivet-popper hypothesis, proposed by Paul \nEhrlich. The idea is you can remove some rivets from an airplane\u2019s wing without consequence \nbecause the engineers designed the wing with redundance in mind. But at a certain point the \nplane becomes unsafe.  \n \nEhrlich used this metaphor to consider the removal of species from an ecosystem. While another \nspecies may step in to serve the functional role of the extinct species, beyond a point there are \nnot enough species to go around, and the system collapses. As with markets, the relationship \nbetween the species population (biodiversity) and the ecosystem performance is nonlinear. 8    \n \nWe\u2019ll now turn to three examples of nonlinearity in complex systems. We start with a physical \nsystem and move toward today\u2019s environment. \n \nLondon Bridge Is Swaying \u2018Round \n \nOn June 10, 2000, the Millennium Bridge opened to the public with great fanfare. London\u2019s first \nbridge across the Thames in over a century, it had a sleek design\u2014the architect wanted it to look \nlike a \u201cblade of light.\u201d 9 However, when thousands of people stepped on the bridge that day, it \nstarted to sway from side to side so much that people had to stop or hold on to the rails. Fearing \nfor the public\u2019s safety, officials closed the bridge two days later and, following a retrofitting, it \nreopened in February 2002. \n \nWhat led to this high-profile failure? People exert a small amount of lateral excitation when they \nwalk. Normally, these excitations cancel out when a group crosses a bridge. However, the \nMillennium Bridge initially had insufficient lateral dampeners, which allowed a little swaying when \na sufficient number of people were on the bridge. That swaying forced people to change their gait \nby widening their steps, leading to greater lateral excitation and more swaying. The wobbling and \ncrowd synchrony emerged simultaneously. 10 \n \nThe crucial insight is the existence of a critical point. Simulations show that roughly 165 people \ncan walk on the bridge with little impact on the wobble amplitude (see Exhibit 1). But adding just a \nfew more pedestrians causes the amplitude to change dramatically, especially as the feedback \nbetween gait adjustment and wobble amplitude kicks in (see the dashed line in Exhibit 1). For the \nfirst 165 bridge crossers, there\u2019s little wobble and no sense of any potential hazard even though \nthe bridge is on the cusp of a state change.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Abrams, Allan \nMcRobbie, Bruno Eckhardt, and Edward Ott, \u201cCrowd Synchrony on the Millennium Bridge,\u201d Nature, Vol. 483, 3, November 2005, 43. \n \nYou can imagine testing the bridge with 50, 100, or even 150 people. The harmful wobble lies in \nthe wait, outside of your awareness. The large-scale outcome is due to the internal workings of \nthe system\u2014people walking\u2014not from some external shock. But it is a real risk.   \n \nSecret Agent Man Reveals All \n \nOur next example, based on the work of economist Blake LeBaron, is much closer to the real \nworld of markets. 11 LeBaron is a leader in creating agent-based models to analyze economic \nproblems, including asset pricing. These models treat the market as a complex adaptive system \nwith diverse agents, a well-functioning aggregation function, and proper incentives. What makes \nthis work so exciting is that by studying various facets of the system, we can gain insight into how \nthe pricing mechanism works. \n \nLeBaron\u2019s model has 1,000 agents, each with well-defined portfolio objectives. He provides the \nagents with a menu of strategies, which evolve over time. He then lets agents trade, resulting in \nan asset price. While quite simple, LeBaron\u2019s model replicates many empirical features of real \nmarkets, including fat-tailed return distributions, volatility patterns, and persistence.  \n \nOne of the model\u2019s most striking findings is the relationship between diversity and asset price. \nThe bottom panel of Exhibit 2 shows a measure of diversity\u2014the degree of rule dispersion. Lower \ndispersion means less diversity. The top panel shows the asset price.  \n \n \n \n"

Used with \npermission. \n \nStudy the first 80 periods for a moment. Diversity declines steadily, even as the asset price rises. \nAs the asset reaches a short-term price peak, diversity is at its lowest. This is an example of \ninvisible vulnerability, similar to what we saw with the bridge.   \n \nLeBaron discusses how crashes happen: 12 \n \nDuring the run-up to a crash, population diversity falls. Agents begin to use very similar \ntrading strategies as their common good performance begins to self-reinforce. This \nmakes the population very brittle, in that a small reduction in the demand for shares could \nhave a strong destabilizing impact on the market. The economic mechanism here is \nclear. Traders have a hard time finding anyone to sell to in a falling market since \neveryone else is following very similar strategies. In the Walrasian setup used here, this \nforces the price to drop by a large magnitude to clear the market. The population \nhomogeneity translates into a reduction in market liquidity. \n \nLeBaron\u2019s model captures many important themes of real-world markets. Add to this model the \nuse of leverage to enhance the performance of diminishing-return strategies, and the stage is set \nfor large-scale change. This model reveals a concrete link between diversity reduction and asset \nprice changes. 13 \n \n \n"

      "text": " \nPage 6 \n \nLegg Mason Capital Management \nThe Pain of 2007 \n \nWe\u2019ll end our tour with a contemporary example of a market-neutral hedge fund. We selected a \nmarket-neutral fund in large part because such funds seek to do well in any market environment \n(i.e., not to be correlated with the market). Exhibit 3 shows the performance of one of these funds \nfor most of 2007. Visually compare Exhibit 3 with the first 100 periods in the top panel of Exhibit \n2. Certainly the pattern is similar. \n \nExhibit 3: Performance of a Market-Neutral Fund, Summer 2007 \n \n \nSource: LMCM analysis.  \n \nThis process has developed numerous times in 2007, leading to some high-profile fund failures. \nIn reality, nothing is really unique about 2007, as we have seen similar events unfold in the past. \n \nHere are the three central points: \n \n\u2022 \nAvoid the problem of induction. Humans like to generalize about a system based on a \nlimited sample. The problem of induction reminds us that falsification serves us better \nthan verification. When an asset price is going up, the natural assumption is it will \ncontinue to do so. Indeed, prosperity can breed an unhealthy sense of security. \n \n\u2022 \nBe mindful of diversity breakdowns. There is no simple way to measure the degree of \ndiversity in the real world. But if a large group of investors seem to all be doing well \npursuing a similar strategy, chances are there is a great deal of invisible vulnerability. We \nsaw this in the first quarter of 2000 when many mutual funds were strongly overweight \ntechnology shares. More recently, it has been some quantitative trading strategies. But \ndiversity breakdowns do not reveal themselves a little at a time, it is closer to binary. \n \n\u2022 \nWatch for the nonlinear reaction. Critical points exist in markets as they do in most \ncomplex systems. When diversity levels are low, small perturbations lead to outcomes \ncompletely out of proportion with their size. Critical points are endogenous to financial \nmarkets, and they can be enhanced through leverage and government policy.   \n14.5\n15.0\n15.5\n16.0\n16.5\n12/08/06\n1/03/07\n1/25/07\n2/15/07\n3/09/07\n3/30/07\n4/23/07\n5/14/07\n6/05/07\n6/26/07\n7/18/07\n8/08/07\n8/29/07\n9/20/07\n10/11/07\n11/01/07\n11/23/07\nPrice ($)\n"
