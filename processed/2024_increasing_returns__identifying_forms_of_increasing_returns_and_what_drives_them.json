The story of the pin factory shows how \nthe division of labor can lead to a cost advantage and, ultimately, \nincreasing returns. The invisible hand metaphor suggests that \neconomic participants acting in their own interests will drive the \nmarket toward equilibrium, suggesting decreasing returns.2    \nAssessing when and how increasing or decreasing returns are \ndominant is a key task of economic observers, policy makers, and \ninvestors. The concept of increasing returns describes the case \nwhen a marginal investment generates an output above the \naverage. Decreasing returns prevails when a marginal investment \nproduces an output below the average.  \nDecreasing returns is the default condition because it is the \nnatural result of competition. For example, a firm earning a high \nmarkup, where the price of the good is above the marginal cost, \nwill entice competitors to enter the market and sell the product at \na lower price.  \nThe back and forth between competitors will drive the price toward \nthe marginal cost. George Stigler, an economist and winner of the \nNobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, stated flatly, \u201cThere \nis no more important proposition in economic theory than that, \nunder competition, the rate of return on investment tends toward \nequality in all industries.\u201d3 \nTwo empirical findings support Stigler\u2019s point. The first is the well-\ndocumented evidence that businesses with a high return on \ninvested capital (ROIC), a measure of profit divided by invested \ncapital, see their ROICs regress toward the opportunity cost of \ncapital.4 Although the rate at which ROICs regress varies by \nindustry and company, the broad pattern is a constant.5 \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J.

This indicates a price above the marginal cost but also a limited ability to earn an ROIC substantially \nabove the cost of capital. Decreasing returns documents that firms struggle to earn and sustain economic profits \nabove the cost of capital. \nThe hallmarks of increasing returns for a business are rising ROICs and a high market share. Right around 1980, \nROICs and markups started to rise in the U.S. as measured using standard accounting. For example, one \nmeasure of return on investment for U.S. companies doubled from 1980 to 2023, and markups rose steadily \nfrom roughly 1.2 in 1980 to about 1.5 today.6  \nThis picture is not quite right for reasons that are central to this report. Traditional measures of ROIC and markup \ndo not accurately reflect intangible investments, which are not physical but can still create value. Research that \nproperly reflects the impact of intangibles shows that the rise of ROICs and markups is much more muted than \nwhat the unadjusted figures suggest.7 \nIncreasing returns clearly plays a role in industry formation, market structure, international trade, and economic \ngrowth. Informed investors benefit from an understanding of increasing returns as they assess both macro- and \nmicroeconomic developments. \nThis report discusses where increasing returns is relevant. The review is non-technical but seeks to highlight the \nimportant ideas. Increasing returns is a deep topic that is the subject of dozens of academic papers and books.8 \nOne of those books, Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations by David Warsh, a journalist, provides the framework \nfor much of this discussion. Further, a number of businesspeople and investors learned about increasing returns \nthrough researchers affiliated with the Santa Fe Institute (SFI).9 SFI, founded in 1984, does basic science across \ndisciplines to search \u201cfor order in the complexity of evolving worlds.\u201d \nIdeas are an important ingredient in economic growth. As the foundation for economic activity shifts from being \nbased on tangible to intangible assets, understanding the characteristics of intangible assets is becoming more \nrelevant by the day. Some of these characteristics are favorable, including the ability to share ideas and to use \nthem as the building blocks for innovation. Others create challenges, such as the protection of intellectual capital \nand the risk of obsolescence. \nWe review five areas of economic analysis where the concept of increasing returns applies. This simple \ntaxonomy belies substantial overlap between the parts. We describe these areas and attempt to show where \nand why they may be relevant to investors today. \nAlthough Adam Smith pointed out increasing returns two and a half centuries ago, much of economic theory \nover time has featured perfect competition and decreasing returns. However, Kenneth Arrow, an economist and \nalso a Nobel Prize winner, noted that a review of economic studies over time reveals that, \u201c[the theory of \nincreasing returns] acts like an underground river, springing to the surface only every few decades.\u201d10 Research \nover the past 50 years has allowed the river to flow to the surface, and it is time to see what it has to say and \nwhat it means. \n \n \n \n"

The first source of increasing returns is economies of scale, very much what Adam Smith \nhad in mind when he described the pin factory. Economies of scale exist when a company \u201ccan perform essential \ntasks . . . at a lower cost per unit as volume increases.\u201d11 \nSmith illustrates the benefits of the specialization of skills as the result of the division of labor. He argues that a \nsingle person executing all of the manufacturing steps would struggle to make one pin and \u201ccertainly could not \nmake twenty\u201d in a day. But by breaking down the task of making a pin into 18 steps, 10 workers would be able \nto produce 48,000 pins in a day, a massive increase in output. \nSmith knew that the extent of the division of labor is a function of the size of the market. When markets are \nsmall, division of labor does not pay off and workers have to do many tasks. Think of a startup. But division of \nlabor does work for large markets because it makes sense to disaggregate activities so that workers are more \nefficient. \nEconomists depict economies of scale with a cost curve placed on a chart where the horizontal (X) axis \nrepresents output and the vertical (Y) axis is cost per unit (see exhibit 1). The curve starts in the upper left corner \nand drops, before bottoming and then moving back up. Minimum efficient scale is the level of output a company \nmust achieve to exhaust economies of scale.12   \nExhibit 1: Average Cost Curve  \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global. \nThe curve moves up again, reflecting higher average cost per unit, as a consequence of diseconomies of scale. \nThe sources of diseconomies of scale include complexity, bureaucracy, and coordination costs.  \nNote that operating leverage is distinct but related to economies of scale. Operating leverage leads to lower cost \nper unit as the result of spreading preproduction costs over a larger volume of output. Preproduction costs \ncapture the money a company spends before it can launch a good or service. Instances of preproduction costs \ninclude writing the software code for a new operating system or building a factory to manufacture shoes.  \nOutput\nCost per \nUnit\nMinimum \nEfficient \nScale\n"

A fixed cost, generally linked to an \nasset that is not sold or used up in the normal course of business, occurs independent of output. A variable cost, \nsuch as commissions based on sales, rises and falls with output. Companies have high operating leverage when \na small change in sales leads to a relatively large change in operating profit. For example, the operating leverage \nfor the materials sector is roughly double that of the consumer staples sector.13  \nEconomies of scale as a source of increasing returns is based on the idea that one company can gain scale at \nthe expense of its competitors and expand until it becomes a monopoly. Empirically, we see some cases of \nwinner-take-most markets, for example internet search, but more commonly we see market shares that are more \ndispersed. Ultimately, the success of economies of scale is conditional on the size and growth of the market, the \nnature of the cost structure of a business, and the ability to fend off the drivers of diseconomies of scale.  \nInternational Trade. Paul Krugman, an economist who also won the Nobel Prize, mentioned to a colleague in \n1977 that he was working on international trade. The other professor said, \u201cTrade is such a monolithic field. It\u2019s \na finished structure, with nothing interesting left to do.\u201d14 Krugman is probably better known today as a contributor \nof opinion columns at The New York Times, but his contributions to new trade theory proved that there was still \na lot left to do. \nIn 1817, David Ricardo, a political economist, had come up with the idea of comparative advantage.15 The \nconcept is somewhat counterintuitive. It shows that if two countries produce two commodities, they are better \noff trading even if one country has a cost disadvantage in producing both commodities. The key is to focus on \ncomparative advantage: if the country with the higher cost produces the good where its comparative cost gap is \nlower and the countries trade, both are better off.16  \nRicardo\u2019s theory was and is hugely valuable but fails to address what Krugman calls \u201csimilar-similar\u201d trade. \nComparative advantage explained well the trade between dissimilar goods and dissimilar countries in the first \nwave of globalization. Krugman notes that in 1910 the vast majority of British exports were in what the country \ndid well, manufactured goods, and the vast majority of the imports were in what the country lacked, raw materials. \nBy 1990, manufactured goods still dominated exports but were also three-quarters of the imports.  \nKrugman was then exposed to models of \u201cmonopolistic competition,\u201d most notably the Dixit-Stiglitz model, that \nhe saw as a \u201cgadget\u201d that provides insight into international trade.17 Monopolistic competition describes a \ncondition when companies compete against one another but produce goods that are somewhat different. For \nexample, France and Germany might trade automobiles as the comfort of French cars is appealing to some \nGerman customers and the performance of German cars is attractive to a subset of French buyers.  \nKrugman\u2019s insight was \u201ccountries that were identical in resources and technology would nonetheless specialize \nin producing different products, giving rise to trade as consumers sought variety.\u201d18 This explains intra-industry \nspecialization and increasing returns. \nHe then reintroduced comparative advantage, inter-industry specialization, to round out the picture.19 By doing \nso, he created a framework that accommodated both competition and increasing returns.20  \nKrugman also contributed to the field of \u201ceconomic geography.\u201d He lays out a very simple model where a \ncompany has two markets with fixed demand and one is larger than the other. Shipping product from one market \nto the other incurs an expense and opening a second facility creates an extra fixed cost.  \n \n"

But it will open a second facility if its \nadditional fixed cost is less than the transportation costs. \nThis basic model leaves out a number of salient considerations related to industry structure and the nature of \nconsumer demand. Alfred Marshall, an economist known for his opus, Principles of Economics, offers factors to \nexplain industry concentration including specialized suppliers, a robust market for capable labor, and knowledge \nsharing.21 The Dixit-Stiglitz model helped explain the first and Krugman and his contemporaries set out to explain \nthe others. \nInternational trade is an important topic today given current geopolitical dynamics. Over the last 150 years, there \nhave been distinct phases in international trade (see exhibit 2). The late 1800s through the beginning of World \nWar I was a period of steady trade growth driven by industrialization. This was \u201cdissimilar-dissimilar\u201d trade that \nthe comparative advantage model explained well. From World War I to the end of World War II, trade dropped \nas a reflection of the conflicts and rising protectionism. After World War II, trade again climbed steadily until the \nglobal financial crisis of 2007 to 2009.  \nSince then, we have seen trade plateau in what economists at the International Monetary Fund call \n\u201cslowbalization,\u201d which reflects \u201ca prolonged slowdown in the pace of trade reform, and weakening political \nsupport for open trade amid rising geopolitical tensions.\u201d22  \nExhibit 2: Regimes in International Trade, 1874-2021 \n \nSource: Douglas A.

Kenneth Arrow\u2019s Nobel Prize was awarded for his work on general equilibrium theory, \nwhich is the study of supply, demand, and prices across multiple markets. But his most cited paper is on the \ntopic of learning by doing, which he wrote in 1962.24 \nEconomists knew that the inputs of labor and capital did not explain economic output well before Arrow wrote \nthat paper. Another factor, often simply called \u201ctechnology,\u201d was contributing to output. Technology is \u201cthe way \ninputs to the production process are transformed into output.\u201d25 The paper sought to make technology an \nendogenous part of economic growth and required that workers could learn.26  \nArrow\u2019s non-technical setup was straightforward. He argued that learning comes from experience and that \nrepetition contributes to learning. The more experience you have in doing something, the better you can do it.  \nOne example that economists commonly cite to demonstrate this idea is the ironworks at Horndal, Sweden, a \ntown about 175 kilometers northwest of Stockholm. From 1935 to 1950, the owner decided to keep the facility \nopen but to invest no incremental capital. During that time, output per worker hour grew two percent per year. \nArrow chalked up those gains to learning by doing.27   \nScientists, including a trio affiliated with the Santa Fe Institute, sought to figure out which of six models most \naccurately explain the drop in the cost of producing one unit of a good. They adjusted all of the figures for \ninflation. To evaluate the models, they examined the cost and production data for more than 60 technologies.28 \nMoore\u2019s Law, which says that cost reductions are a function of time as the result of technological improvement, \nis the best known of the models. Created in 1965 by Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, the law said \nthe number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every year.29 Ten years later, he revised the time \nto double to two years.30 \nThe researchers found that Wright\u2019s Law performed the best. T. P. Wright was an engineer and a naval aircraft \ninspector during World War I. After the war, he joined Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company and, knowing that \nthe cost of planes would have to come down sharply to be commercially viable, kept track of industry capacity \nand labor efficiency.  \nWright\u2019s Law is based on his finding, published in 1936, that the number of hours of labor required to produce \nan airframe declined as a function of the cumulative number fabricated. The precise formula says the amount of \nlabor hours per unit equals N-1/3. Translated into everyday language, this says that the labor hours per unit \ndecline 20 percent for each doubling of cumulative output.31  \nWright\u2019s Law and Moore\u2019s Law were both good at explaining cost reductions for the technologies the researchers \nexamined. But note the difference: Moore\u2019s Law is about improvement in technology and therefore is a function \nof time. Wright\u2019s Law is based on experience and is therefore a function of cumulative output. Wright\u2019s Law is \nlargely about learning by doing. \nIn practice, it is difficult to discern whether lower costs per unit are the result of technological improvement, \neconomies of scale, or learning by doing.32 Both economies of scale and learning by doing can support \nincreasing returns, especially if one company gets ahead of its competitors. \nSolar panel production is an industry where learning by doing may be an important driver of costs. Exhibit 3 \nshows the decline in the price of solar photovoltaic technology, or solar panels, as a function of cumulative \ninstalled capacity from 1976 to 2022. Note that both axes are on a logarithmic scale. For each doubling of \ncapacity, prices declined by just under 20 percent.33 This is essentially what Wright\u2019s Law predicts. \n"

The learning curve has led to a price \ndecline of 18 percent for every doubling of cumulative output.34 Tesla, a company that designs and manufactures \nelectric vehicles, has benefitted from lower battery costs and also operates the most productive automobile plant \nin the U.S.35 In the cases of batteries and electric vehicle production, cumulative output has moved Tesla down \nthe cost curve faster than its competitors.  \nPositive Feedback and Network Effects. Negative feedback is associated with decreasing returns. Positive \nfeedback is associated with increasing returns. Positive feedback is a key mechanism in markets where one \nwinner takes all or most of the economic profits. \nA thermostat is a good metaphor for negative feedback and corporate results. You set your thermostat to a \nparticular temperature. If the temperature rises too much, the thermostat signals the cooling system to turn on \nand return the temperature back to the setting. Likewise, if the temperature drops too much the thermostat \nactivates the heating system. The system is designed to maintain the temperature near the level set. \nFor companies, the set temperature is the cost of capital and the thermometer measures ROIC. If a company\u2019s \nROIC gets too high, or hot, competitors act like the switch in the thermostat and attempt to enter the market and \npush the returns lower. If the ROIC gets too low, or cold, there is disinvestment or consolidation that allows \nreturns to improve. This is all consistent with regression toward the mean for ROIC.  \nBut there are cases where positive feedback dominates. One example is competition between multiple formats \nthat are different but serve the same purpose. Classic examples include track gauge (the distance between the \nrails on a railway track), driving on the left or right side of the street, and Betamax and Video Home System \n(VHS) videocassettes. In these cases, the formats compete until one reaches a tipping point, beyond which \npositive feedback takes over and establishes that format as the standard.  \n0\n1\n10\n100\n0\n1\n10\n100\n1,000\n10,000\n100,000\n1,000,000\n10,000,000\nPrice Per Watt in 2022 U.S. Dollars (Log)\nCumulative Installed Capacity in Megawatts (Log)\n"

But by the late 1980s VHS reached a tipping point and Betamax was discontinued. \nExplanations for VHS\u2019s success after the fact include a longer recording time than Betamax, which allowed for \nshare gains that led to economies of scale and ultimately the support of movie studios and rental outlets that \npreferred to work with a sole standard.36    \nExplaining why one format won is easy after the battle is over. But uncertainty and luck can play enormous roles \nin shaping the outcome.37 One famous, albeit disputed, story is about the QWERTY keyboard.38 Developed in \nthe 1870s and designed to reduce the jamming of the keys of physical typewriters, QWERTY\u2019s rights were sold \nto E. Remington & Sons, an early and successful typewriter manufacturer.  \nUsers then learned to use a QWERTY keyboard, which increased switching costs, propelled demand, and \nlocked in the popularity of the format. In the 1930s, a professor named August Dvorak developed an alternative \nkeyboard that was ergonomically superior and purportedly allowed for faster typing. But the market had already \ntipped in favor of the QWERTY over the Dvorak. \nThis pattern of runaway success extends to social systems as well, including who becomes famous, what song \nis a hit, and which books reach the bestseller list. Robert K. Merton, a professor of sociology, called it the \n\u201cMatthew Effect\u201d after a verse in the Gospel of Matthew (13:12) that says, essentially, the rich get richer and the \npoor get poorer.39    \nAn indicator of positive feedback is that one competitor has an extremely high market share. Examples include \nMicrosoft\u2019s share in operating systems for desktop personal computers and Google\u2019s in internet search. But it is \ncrucial to acknowledge that anticipating which technology will win is a challenge early on. Exhibit 4 shows the \nmarket share for the internet search industry from 1994-2023. In the late 1990s, the market shares changed \nsignificantly, and it was not until the early 2000s that Google\u2019s position was established.     \nExhibit 4: Market Share for the Internet Search Industry, 1994-2023  \n \nSource: Statcounter; www.dailymotion.com/video/x81fzhm; Counterpoint Global. \nNote: Includes search engines that were among the top five at any point during this period.  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nMarket Share (Percent)\nGoogle\n"

All rights reserved. \n6270554 Exp. 1/31/2025 \n9\n \n \nIn 1987, Kenneth Arrow and Philip Anderson, a professor of physics and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, \nconvened a workshop at the Santa Fe Institute called \u201cEvolutionary Paths of the Global Economy.\u201d40 The idea \nwas that Arrow would invite economists and Anderson would invite researchers in the physical sciences, \nincluding physicists.41 Arrow invited his colleague at Stanford University, W. Brian Arthur, an economist who had \ndone early work on the mechanisms that generate increasing returns.42 Arthur would go on to be the first director \nof the economic program at SFI. Lots of the investors who were early to appreciate increasing returns heard \nabout the concept from Arthur at SFI.43     \nIn many cases, positive feedback leads to one format winning over others but does not translate into economic \nprofit. The width of track gauge, driving on the left side of the road, or typing on a QWERTY keyboard do not \nconfer competitive advantage to railroads, automobile manufacturers, or producers of keyboards. But there are \ninstances where positive feedback leads to the formation of networks that are extremely valuable. \nIn Principles of Economics, Alfred Marshall, one of history\u2019s most influential economists, said costs can go down \nfor two reasons. The first is \u201cinternal economies,\u201d which are \u201cthose dependent on the resources of the individual \nhouses of business.\u201d The second is \u201cexternal economies,\u201d which are \u201cdependent on the general development of \nthe industry.\u201d44 These external economies, or \u201cexternalities,\u201d are costs or benefits that the market does not price. \nAs with platform battles, positive feedback tends to lead to one network becoming dominant. For example, \nFacebook, part of Meta Platforms, Inc., is the world\u2019s largest social media business today with three billion \nmonthly active users. But Facebook had to beat out rival networks to ascend to its dominant position. These \nincluded Friendster and MySpace, sites that launched before Facebook did.  \nNetwork effects exist when the value of a good or service increases as more people use the good or service. \nOne way to measure changes in the value of the network is through willingness to pay (WTP), the most a \nconsumer is willing to pay to use a good or service. Once a network becomes dominant, WTP rises because \nusers are locked in and face substantial switching costs if they move to a smaller network. The sum of these \ncosts is a substantial barrier to entry for a fledgling network seeking to topple an incumbent.45    \nThere are different types of networks. In a direct network, users connect without an agent in the middle. A \ntelephone network is a classic example. In an indirect network, value comes from the presence of complements, \nor goods or services that are consumed with other goods or services. The WTP of one good or service goes up \nif the cost of its complement goes down. Electric vehicles and charging stations are a good case of \ncomplementary products. The growth and value of the network depends on the co-evolution of electric vehicles \nand charging stations.    \nPlatform businesses that match two sides of a market can also have strong network effects. The rideshare \nindustry is a good illustration. More drivers attract more riders, and more riders attract more drivers. If two \nnetworks compete and one reaches a tipping point, the other will have a tough time competing profitably. \nCompanies that benefit from positive feedback and network effects can create a substantial amount of \nshareholder value because they draw on two forms of increasing returns. The first is classic economies of scale, \nwhere demand for additional supply leads to lower costs per unit. But the benefits of economies of scale can be \nlimited as companies grow and factors creep in that lead to diseconomies of scale.  \nThe second is based on network effects, where WTP continues to increase as the product remains in demand. \nUnlike economies of scale from the supply side, economies of scale from the demand side do not dissipate as \nlong as a network remains healthy. Many of the world\u2019s most valuable companies have enjoyed increasing \nreturns through positive feedback and network effects.  \n"

Matt Ridley, a journalist and businessman, is fond of saying that innovation comes \nfrom \u201cideas having sex.\u201d By that he means that humans have prospered, especially in the last 250 years, by \ncombining ideas and sharing the successful output with others. Innovation, ideas that create something new or \nimprove on current processes, raise the standard of living.46  \nRidley\u2019s phase is catchy but John Holland had formalized the concept years before with his development of the \ngenetic algorithm. Holland was a professor of engineering, psychology, and computer science at the University \nof Michigan. He was the first recipient of a Ph.D. in computer science and one of the intellectual founders of the \nSanta Fe Institute.  \nA genetic algorithm uses evolutionary processes to solve a problem. The inputs are a population of individuals, \nin this case computer programs, and a fitness function that determines how well each individual solves the \nproblem. The individuals can be random to start. The next step is to take the individuals with the highest fitness, \npair them, and let them have \u201csex\u201d by recombining their parts and allowing for some rate of mutation.  \nThe pairs generate sufficient progeny to create a population as large as the original one, and the process repeats \nuntil the programs achieve sufficient fitness to solve the problem. The method is similar to breeders seeking \nparticular traits in animals.47 \nLabor and capital are the classic inputs into a production function to describe economic output.48 But economists \nobserved that the rate of growth in output was faster than the rate of growth in inputs and therefore knew that \ntechnology is important. Ideas are what improve technology. \nRobert Solow, an economist who received the Nobel Prize, wrote a paper in 1956 that featured an equation that \nshowed that the growth of output was a function of classic inputs, labor and capital, plus a constant to reflect \naccumulated knowledge.49 The difference between the growth attributable to labor and capital and the actual \ngrowth is known as Solow\u2019s residual or the more elaborate \u201ctotal factor productivity.\u201d While Solow\u2019s model \nallowed for increasing returns, he worked within the classic framework of perfect competition and treated \naccumulated knowledge as a public good that could be accessed by all without cost.50 \nIn the old theory, economic growth is a function of labor and capital with knowledge as an external, or exogenous, \nsource of growth. In the new theory, economic growth is a function of people, things, and ideas. But the important \npoint is that ideas are an internal, or endogenous, source of growth.51 \nRestating both Ridley and Holland, innovation comes from combining building blocks of ideas. An increase in \nthe number of building blocks and improvements in the ability to manipulate them computationally lead to the \npotential for faster growth. In other words, increasing returns. We see this, for example, with the superlinear \nscaling of innovation in cities. Larger cities, where ideas have more opportunity to interact, produce more \ninnovation per capita than do smaller cities.52  \nPaul Romer, an economist, put these pieces together in a formal framework that led to him winning the Nobel \nPrize. The analysis in his most famous paper is based on three premises. First, technological change, which is \na set of instructions for reshaping the physical world, is core to economic growth. Second, actors who respond \nto market incentives pursue this change intentionally. And third, these instructions are distinct from other goods \nin that they can be costly to develop but are essentially free to share.  \nRomer added some critical elements to the growth model that made it more realistic and, as it turns out, more \nrelevant to investors.53 \n"

The first is \u201crivalry.\u201d A rival good is one that \nonly one person can use at a time. The clothing you are wearing and the pen in your hand are rival goods. These \nare tangible assets. A nonrival good is one that many can use at the same time, and include recipes, algorithms, \nor sets of instructions. The operating system on your smartphone or favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies \nare nonrival goods. These are intangible assets. Companies have rival and nonrival assets.  \nThe second concept is \u201cexcludability.\u201d An excludable good is one that the owner can prevent others from using. \nExcludability is established through the legal system, including patents and copyrights, as well as technology. \nNonexcludable goods are those that anyone can use. Romer recognized that some nonrival goods can be \n\u201cpartially excludable,\u201d permitting firms to profit from their intangible investments.  \nThink of a pharmaceutical company. The recipe for a drug is a nonrival good and the factory that produces the \npills is a rival good. The formula for the drug that the pharmaceutical company produces is partially excludable \nuntil its patent runs out.  \nExhibit 5 summarizes the potential combinations of rivalry and excludability. Understanding these possibilities is \nimportant because of the substantial shift in how companies invest. As recently as 1990, tangible investments \nmeaningfully exceeded intangible investments.54 Tangible assets are generally rival and intangible assets are \ncommonly nonrival. This evolution presents businesses with positives and negatives for value creation.55 \nExhibit 5: Rivalry and Excludability  \n \nSource: Counterpoint Global based on Paul M. Romer, \u201cEndogenous Technological Change,\u201d Journal of Political Economy, \nVol. 98, No. 5, Pt. 2, October 1990, S71-S102. \nRomer emphasizes that there are two aspects to driving growth. The first is the discovery of instructions to \nrearrange the physical world to be more valuable. The second is the implementation of the instructions. Over \ntime, the point of emphasis has shifted to discovery from implementation. A steel factory from 1900 had \ninstructions but the vast majority of the effort was in implementation. A biotechnology company today has \nimplementation but dedicates most of its resources to discovery.56    \nExcludable\nRival\nNonrival\nNon-\nExcludable\nHouse\nPatent\nFish in the \nocean\nGovernment \nR&D\nTangible\nIntangible\n"

When successful, these lead to \ngreater scalability and opportunity for recombination. Scalability addresses upfront fixed costs versus \nincremental variable costs. Think of a nonrival good such as a new drug. It is common for companies to spend \n$1 billion or more developing and testing a new drug. But producing the drug tends to be cheap after it has \nproven to be safe and efficacious.  \nInnovators can also use successful products as building blocks for future recombination. Some of the world\u2019s \nmost valuable companies did not exist 30 years ago because the building blocks, such as the internet and \nsufficient computing power, were not around and the problems they solved were yet to appear on the horizon. \nBusinesses come and go because of change in the available building blocks and in problems in need of a \nsolution. \nBut intangible assets have downsides as well. To start, intangible assets are much easier to steal than tangible \nones even if a company tries to make an intangible asset excludable through intellectual property rights. For \nexample, a Chinese entrepreneur named Wang Xing recreated Facebook\u2019s website, down to adding \u201cA Mark \nZuckerberg Production\u201d on each page, and he later cloned Twitter (now called X) and Groupon.57 \nThat said, the gap in productivity between the best and worst companies within industries is large. For instance, \neconomists measured the productivity of U.S. manufacturing plants and found that the output at the 90th \npercentile was nearly double that of those at the 10th percentile. Economists do not fully understand why that \ndifference is so large, but they commonly attribute it to management talent.58 Organizations do not always \nidentify and implement best practices. \nIntangible assets also face the risk of obsolescence. Consider software that has been replaced by a new and \nimproved version, the brand name of a bankrupt business, or a patent on a product that is no longer desired by \nthe market. Further, many tangible assets have salvage value while some intangible assets do not.   \nJames Bessen, Executive Director of the Technology & Policy Research Initiative at Boston University, is an \neconomist who has been studying \u201csuperstar\u201d technology companies.59 These are firms with economic profits \nthat are higher than those of their peers and a profitability gap that is widening. He outlines three things these \nfirms are doing that allow them to sustain a competitive advantage. Romer\u2019s framework provides a useful way \nto assess their actions. \nTo start, superstar firms substantially outspend their competitors on intangible assets. They are spending big on \n\u201cideas\u201d: software, training, and research and development (R&D).60 Bessen documents that spending for \nproprietary software has grown substantially faster than that for R&D, acquisitions, advertising, and lobbying.61 \nU.S. firms spend more than $200 billion per year on proprietary software and the big firms represent the bulk of \nthat outlay. They are investing heavily in nonrival goods. \nBessen then makes the case that proprietary software enables superstar firms to capture classic economies of \nscale and to offer differentiated products. Think of a company such as Amazon potentially benefitting from scale \nas a function of its size as well as being able to understand, based on data, what products to sell to whom. This \nknowledge makes it possible for modern superstar firms to create scale and benefit from complexity in a way \nthat companies simply could not do in the past. \nBessen\u2019s last point has to do with excludability. He tells the story of the automatic transmission on an automobile, \nwhich General Motors (GM) developed in 1940. While protected by patents, the transmission technology diffused \n"

The ideas \nthat led to GM\u2019s transmission ended up as nonrival and nonexcludable goods. \nBy contrast, Bessen argues, the businesses of leading companies today are based on custom software and the \nfirms lack an incentive to license their technology because they do not want to lose their source of differentiation. \nThey are investing heavily in nonrival and excludable goods, which has allowed them to grow with high ROICs. \nExhibit 6 provides a brief summary of the various forms of increasing returns and includes some of the thinkers \nwho contributed to each, the key idea, and why they are relevant. \nExhibit 6: Forms of Increasing Returns \nForm \nPeople \nKey Idea \nRelevance \nEconomies of \nScale \nAdam Smith \nAlfred Marshall \nJohn Stuart Mill \nA company can perform \nessential tasks at a lower cost \nper unit as volume increases. \nOne company gains scale at the \nexpense of its competitors and keeps \nexpanding until it becomes a monopoly. \nInternational \nTrade \nDavid Ricardo \nPaul Krugman \nFirms create many products that \nare differentiated and achieve \neconomies of scale through \ntrade. \nThis combines traditional comparative \nadvantage with monopolistic \ncompetition to explain increasing \nreturns. \nLearning by \nDoing \nKen Arrow  \nPaul Romer \nRobert Lucas Jr. \nT.P.

All rights reserved. \n6270554 Exp. 1/31/2025 \n14\n \n \nConclusion \nOver time, the emphasis of economics has been on how returns decrease toward an equilibrium between price \nand marginal cost. There is a great deal of empirical evidence for decreasing returns. Businesses with high \nROICs tend to see their returns revert toward the opportunity cost of capital over time. This is especially relevant \nfor sectors that rely predominantly on tangible assets. \nBut even Adam Smith, writing in 1776, recognized the potential for increasing returns. Economists faced the \nchallenge of identifying different forms of increasing returns and understanding the mechanisms that drive them. \nMuch of this work has occurred following World War II. \nThis research is more important than ever as our global economy shifts from a reliance on tangible to intangible \nassets. Physical things are becoming less important and non-physical instructions on how to rearrange the world \nprofitably are more important.    \nThis report discusses five forms of increasing returns. They tend to overlap and are useful to understand in the \ncontext of industry formation, market structure, international trade, and economic growth. All of them have \nrelevance in the investment process. Increasing returns shows up as rising ROICs and high market share. \nThe importance of most forms of increasing returns is deeply intertwined with the rise of intangible assets. Some \nof the characteristics of tangible and intangible assets are notably different. Intangible assets can scale faster \nthan tangible ones but are also harder to protect. Intangible assets can lead to a faster rate of innovation but are \nsubject to obsolescence. \nThis discussion of increasing returns is relevant for a number of key issues that investors are grappling with, \nincluding what is happening in global trade, discussions about antitrust policy, the rise of superstar firms, the \nevolution of industry structure for relatively new industries, and the overall rate of economic growth.   \n \nPlease see Important Disclosures on pages 23-25 \n     \n \n"
