If you do believe that, you recognize that you have to \ngrapple with an assessment of the magnitude and timing of cash flows \nas well as the appropriate rate at which to discount them. \nFor a company, the relevant definition of cash flow is the money that \ncan be returned to claimholders, including the owners of the bonds \nand the stock. Cash flow is the profit the business earns after paying \ntaxes minus the investments the company makes. Investments are \noutlays today with the expectation of profits tomorrow that make the \ninvestments worthwhile.  \nThe magnitude of cash flows is a function of opportunity and \neconomics. You can think of opportunity as the total addressable \nmarket (TAM), defined as the revenue a company would realize if it had \n100 percent share of a market it could serve while creating shareholder \nvalue.1 Many investors use the concept of TAM to gauge a company\u2019s \npotential size. \nThe second part of the definition is equally important and attends \nto the economics. A company\u2019s objective should not be simply to \ngrow; it should be to grow such that it creates value. A company \ncreates value when its investments earn a return higher than the \nopportunity cost of capital.  \nYou can imagine that there are some very large addressable \nmarkets with poor prospects for value creation and some small \nmarkets with excellent economic prospects. The holy grail is large \nmarkets with attractive economics. \nAUTHORS \n \nMichael J. Mauboussin \nmichael.mauboussin@morganstanley.com \n \nDan Callahan, CFA \ndan.callahan1@morganstanley.com \n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3113422 Exp. 06/30/2021 \n2 \n \nNaturally, opportunities that are big and lucrative attract a lot of attention from current and potential \ncompetitors. Barriers to entry are crucial. Bruce Greenwald, a renowned professor at Columbia Business \nSchool, goes so far as to say that \u201ccompetitive advantages are actually barriers to entry.\u201d2 So investors have to \nthink hard about how leading companies in large markets can sustain their positions. \nUnderstanding the magnitude and return on investments is crucial. Investments have traditionally been in the \nform of tangible assets that show up on the balance sheet. Examples include increases in working capital or \ncapital expenditures. But in recent decades investments have shifted in form to intangible assets, which are \nexpensed on the income statement and are typically absent on the balance sheet (except for when one \ncompany acquires another).3  \nThis is important because companies that invest heavily in intangible assets and have high returns on those \ninvestments often produce poor profits, or may even lose money. As an investor, you want that kind of \ncompany to invest as much as it can. The income statement looks bad, the balance sheet looks better, and the \nvalue creation looks great.  \nContrast this to generations past when tangible investments were captured on the balance sheet. In those \ndays, the income statement looked good but the balance sheet looked bad.  \nSaying this differently, two companies can have the same level of investment and return on investment but \nvery different financial statements based on where accountants record investments. Free cash flow, the \nnumber we care about, may be the same but the path to get there is different. \nThere\u2019s another important aspect about companies that make large investments today. They are telling their \nshareholders, \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you little or no money today but expect to give you a lot more money in the \nfuture.\u201d That means the cash investors can put in their pockets is both a bigger amount and further in the \nfuture. \nThat leads to the concept of a discount rate. The rate at which you discount future cash flows is the \nopportunity cost of capital. An estimate of the cost of capital is the answer to the question, \u201cWhat could I \nreasonably expect to earn for an asset of similar risk?\u201d Asset pricing models attempt to address this question, \nbut the details are less important than the concept. \nInvestors generally \u201cvalue\u201d businesses using multiples. The most common are price/earnings (P/E) and \nenterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA).4 Multiples are \nnot valuation. They are a shorthand for the valuation process. Importantly, multiples obscure the value drivers \nthat investors most care about. These include growth, return on incremental invested capital, and the discount \nrate. As a consequence, investors who do not think in first principles will not understand the justified changes \nin multiples as the result of changes in these value drivers.5 \nLet\u2019s start with the basic example of the commodity P/E multiple. This is the multiple you should pay for $1 of \nearnings into perpetuity assuming no value creation. You calculate the multiple by taking the inverse of the \ncost of equity capital. For example, if the cost of equity is 8 percent, the commodity P/E multiple is 12.5 (1/.08 \n= 12.5).  \nThe classic way to calculate the cost of equity is to start with a risk-free rate and add an equity risk premium \n(ERP). In the U.S., the risk-free rate is typically the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, and the ERP is the \nreturn you expect given the additional risk you assume to own stocks.  \n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3113422 Exp. 06/30/2021 \n3 \n \nThe cost of equity and hence the commodity P/E multiple move around because the risk-free rate and ERP \nmove around. Exhibit 1 shows the commodity P/E multiple from 1961 through May 2020. The multiples are \nbased on estimates of the equity risk premium by Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern \nSchool of Business at New York University and a leading expert in valuation. \nExhibit 1: The Commodity P/E Multiple, 1961-2020 \n \nSource: Aswath Damodaran and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: 2020 as of May 31/June 1 using COVID-adjusted ERP. \nYou can see that the commodity P/E multiple got as low as 5.1 in 1981 when interest rates hit their \ngenerational peak and that the multiple as of June 1, 2020 is 16.7.6 The baseline multiple, which assumes no \nvalue creation, has averaged 10.7 for the full period but has varied quite a bit over this time. The actual P/E \nmultiple for the S&P 500 has been about 35 percent higher than the commodity P/E multiple since 1961, with \nmost observations between 20 and 65 percent higher. \nThe goal of this report is to show how valuations change as we vary assumptions about growth, return on \nincremental invested capital, and the discount rate. We will discuss these changes in terms of P/E multiples, \nbut a discounted cash flow model drives the calculations. We can measure the impact of various assumptions \nbecause we can control the value drivers in the model.  \nA few more thoughts before we turn to the analysis. First, the distinction between value and growth investing is \nhollow. Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, correctly called it \u201cfuzzy \nthinking.\u201d  \nBuffett went on to say, \u201cGrowth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable \nwhose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as \npositive.\u201d He then added, \u201cThe very term \u2018value investing\u2019 is redundant. What is \u2018investing\u2019 if it is not the act of \nseeking value at least sufficient to justify the amount paid?\u201d7  \nThe fundamental principle is that growth only adds value when the company earns a return on its investment \nthat is above its cost of capital. The higher the return, the more sensitive the business is to growth. Growth is \nof no economic significance if a company\u2019s returns are equivalent to the firm\u2019s cost of capital. As a \nconsequence, companies should focus not on growth per se but on value-creating growth. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n1961\n1963\n1965\n1967\n1969\n1971\n1973\n1975\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\n2019\nP/E Multiple (x)\nAverage\n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3113422 Exp. 06/30/2021 \n4 \n \nGrowth destroys value if investments earn a return below the cost of capital. This frequently occurs with \nacquisitions. The buyer proclaims that sales and earnings will be higher than before the deal was announced \neven as it sees its stock sag.   \nBuffett wrote about growth and value in 1992, which is also the year Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, \nprofessors of finance, published a highly influential paper showing that consideration of size and value along \nwith the capital asset pricing model explained stock price returns better than the capital asset pricing model did \nby itself.8 \nThis work popularized the value factor, which is essentially a screen for statistically \u201ccheap\u201d stocks as \nmeasured by multiples such as price/earnings and price/book.9 This in turn led to the categorization of \ninvestment managers as \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201cgrowth\u201d based on this factor, which further reinforced the false dichotomy \nthat Buffett sought to redress.  \nA second thought relates to the concept of duration. More familiar to bond investors than stock investors, \nduration measures the weighted average time investors should expect to wait before they receive cash flows. \nFor example, the duration of a zero-coupon bond is the same as its maturity. All else being equal, bonds that \nmature further into the future have longer durations than bonds that mature sooner.  \nSimilarly, the stocks of companies that have opportunities to make value-creating investments in the short run \nin order to generate higher cash flows in the long run have longer durations than the stocks of companies that \nlack those opportunities. Research shows that lots of investment opportunity is linked to long duration, and \nscant investment opportunity is associated with short duration.10     \nDuration also provides crucial insight into the sensitivity of the asset price to changes in interest rates, or the \ndiscount rate. Long-duration assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than are short-duration \nassets. Keep this in mind: companies that can invest a lot today at high returns on capital will not only grow \nfaster than the average company, their stocks will have valuations that are more sensitive to changes in the \ndiscount rate. \nThe final thought is that low interest rates are commonly associated with slow real earnings growth and below-\naverage business dynamism. This sets up a tug of war where on the one hand low interest rates imply high \nvalues for a stream of cash flows, but on the other hand the prospects are dampened by slower expected cash \nflow growth.  \nThe data suggest that slow growth wins the war. As a result, the P/E multiple for the market has historically \nfollowed an inverted \u201cU\u201d (see exhibit 2). Consistent with the Goldilocks principle, low median P/E multiples are \nassociated with very low and very high interest rates (adjusted for inflation), and high median P/E multiples are \nassociated with real interest rates in the middle of the range.11      \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Shiller, see: www.econ.yale.edu//~shiller/data.htm and Counterpoint Global. \nNote: CAPE ratio is the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio; through March 31, 2020. \nThere\u2019s a part of this story that deserves special scrutiny today. Research shows that low Treasury yields \nallow industry leaders to generate excess returns and that the magnitude of those returns increases as yields \napproach zero.12 While the median P/E may come under pressure as a result of slower growth prospects, a \nhandful of companies may continue to generate strong growth and return on incremental investment.  \nThe Math \nWe start by calibrating our discounted cash flow model with inputs that yield a P/E multiple in the low 30s. \nHere are the definitions and the initial assumptions: \n\uf0b7 We assume net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) will grow 10 percent per annum. NOPAT represents \nthe cash profits a company would earn if it had no financial leverage. \n\uf0b7 We assume a return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) of 20 percent. ROIIC is defined as the \nchange in NOPAT from this year to next year divided by this year\u2019s investment. For example, if NOPAT \ngrows by $10 next year and the company invests $50 this year, the ROIIC is 20 percent (10/50). Note \nthat it does not matter if the investment is expensed or capitalized, save for some effect on taxes. \n\uf0b7 We assume the cost of equity capital to be 6.7 percent, which was Aswath Damodaran\u2019s estimate as of \nFebruary 1, 2020. The cost of equity measures the return an investor expects to earn given the assumed \nrisk. As such, the figure is the sum of the risk-free rate of 1.5 percent and an estimated equity risk \npremium of 5.2 percent. We assume the company is financed solely with equity for simplicity. Adding \ndebt makes the calculations slightly more cumbersome but does not change the story. \n\uf0b7 The model values explicit cash flows for 15 years after which it uses a perpetuity to estimate the residual \nvalue. Specifically, the model takes NOPAT in year 16, which reflects the benefit of the investment made \nin year 15, and capitalizes it by the cost of equity. That figure is then discounted to a present value. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nBelow -1% -1% to 0%\n0%-1%\n1%-2%\n2%-3%\n3%-4%\n4%-5%\n5%-6%\nAbove 6%\nMedian CAPE Ratio (x)\nReal Yield on 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note\n"

Let\u2019s start by reducing the growth rate from 10 percent to 7 percent.

Investors often calculate the P/E multiple using the current \nprice and next year\u2019s earnings. As a result, they sometimes believe that the market overreacts to what appear \nto be modest changes in the near-term earnings. But if expectations for the trajectory of growth really do shift \ndown, the large apparent drop in the P/E multiple is completely justified. \nNow let\u2019s look at how a 300 basis point reduction in expected growth affects the business that is expected to \ngrow 15 percent:    \n \n    Next year\u2019s earnings \n         P/E \nGrowth \n         Before     After \nBefore     After \n15% \u2192 12% \n          $115      $112 \n  52.2       39.0 \nHere, next year\u2019s earnings are revised down by just 2.6 percent, but the warranted P/E multiple is 25.3 percent \nlower. When ROIIC\u2019s are well above the cost of capital, the value of the business is highly sensitive to \nchanges in the growth rate of NOPAT. \nExhibit 3 shows that the relationship between growth and the P/E is convex. Small changes in growth \nexpectations can lead to large changes in the P/E, especially when growth rates are high. \n \n \n \n \n \n"

In that case, a company is spending $1 worth of capital to attain less than \n$1 of value. The faster the company grows the more wealth it destroys.  \nThe exhibit shows that an ROIIC below the cost of capital of 6.7 percent yields a P/E multiple below the \ncommodity multiple. Acquisitions are again a case in point. For buyers, M&A deals commonly add to earnings \ngrowth but subtract from value. You can think of low-ROIIC investments as pushing down the P/E multiple of a \ncompany\u2019s stock toward the commodity multiple.      \nDiscount rate. As of June 1, 2020, Aswath Damodaran\u2019s estimate of the cost of equity dropped to 6.0 percent \nas the result of the market rally in April and May. Investors need to consider the discount rate carefully for a \nfew reasons. \nFirst, the composition of expected returns is markedly different than it was as recently as late 2019. \nSpecifically, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a proxy for the risk-free rate, has declined from 1.9 \npercent at year-end 2019 to about 0.7 percent on June 1, 2020. The equity risk premium, on the other hand, is \nroughly at the same level as year-end after having gone up when the market fell and down when the market \nrose. Nearly 90 percent of the expected return from equities now comes from the risk premium, up from about \n75 percent at the beginning of the year.  \nSecond, this mix shift has implications for asset allocation. Returns for an asset class over a particular period \nare sensitive to the starting and ending valuations. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note today suggests that \nfuture returns for the risk-free rate will be less than those of the past.  \nFinally, and most important to our discussion, long-duration assets are very sensitive to changes in the \ndiscount rate. Those companies that can invest a lot while earning high ROIICs will achieve above-average \ngrowth. In today\u2019s environment of low expected returns, the stocks of these companies are worth substantially \nmore than they were in an environment of higher expected returns.  \nNo one knows where interest rates or the ERP are headed, but everyone should take a moment to appreciate \nthe relationship between the discount rate and long-duration assets. The connection is not intuitive to those \nwho do not deal with the ideas all of the time. \nConclusion \nMost investors value stocks using multiples, which tend to obscure the underlying drivers of value. Many \ninvestors also seek to distinguish between value and growth stocks, which are commonly sorted based on \nmultiples of earnings or book value. The important drivers of value are opaque with these practices, and very \nfew investors have a clear sense of how revisions in expectations for those drivers change multiples.  \nIn particular, we focused on how changes in growth rates can affect P/E multiples, the idea that companies \nwith substantial current investment opportunities that are attractive lengthen their duration, and why the \ndistinction between growth and value is muddled. \nWhile our core hypothetical examples assumed a business with very attractive economics, it is important to \nbear in mind that ROIICs eventually drift lower as a consequence of factors such as competition, maturation, \nobsolescence, and disruption.  \n"

Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. \n3113422 Exp. 06/30/2021 \n11 \n \nRisk Considerations \n \nThere is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, \nwhich is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value \nof Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to \neconomic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect \nmarkets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse \neffects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be \naware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also \nfluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks \nsuch as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market \ncountries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Privately placed \nand restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, \nwhich will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk). \nDerivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. \nThey also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities \nmay be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). \n \nDISTRIBUTION \nThis communication is only intended for and will only be distributed to persons resident in jurisdictions where \nsuch distribution or availability would not be contrary to local laws or regulations. \nIreland: Morgan Stanley Investment Management (Ireland) Limited.
