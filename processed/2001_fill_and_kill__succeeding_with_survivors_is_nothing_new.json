But the\nfundamental question at hand is a simple one: what should investors do today?\nWe should note at the outset that the Internet is a general-purpose, or enabling,\ntechnology. The Internet is not a substitute for a business model, and does not\nconstitute a strategy in and of itself.\n1 By the same token, the boom/bust of the\nInternet is by no means a unique phenomenon\u2014we can document the same\npattern in the biological record as well as the annals of American business.\nThis report contains three main points:\n1. The biological record shows that when conditions are suitable, there is a\nsharp increase in speciation\u2014that is, the number of species\u2014generally\nfollowed by significant extinction. As ecological opportunities arise, species\nrush to fill them. Only after the space is filled does the methodical force of\nevolution winnow the population. One of the best-documented examples is\nthe Cambrian Explosion, which took place roughly 550 million years ago.\nBusiness, like biology, is a messy affair: In the absence of the \u201cgreat capital\nallocator in the sky\u201d, the path to long-term efficient capital allocation is littered\nwith excesses and inefficiencies.\n2. The boom/bust cycle has played out many times in American business. The\nautomobile, television, disk drive and personal computer industries are but a\nfew examples. Here again, a new industry spawned substantial variation and\ninnovation, but only the \u201cfit\u201d, or lucky, companies survived. The Internet has\nfollowed this pattern almost perfectly.\n3. Investors that purchased baskets of \u201csurvivors\u201d have fared reasonably well.\nThe essential point for investors is that buying companies that have survived\na major extinction event increases the odds of investment success even in\nindustries with enormous ongoing competitive pressures.\n"

It's the time when single-celled life first\ntransitioned into multi-celled life, and every experiment of life \u2014 in every form and shape\n\u2014 was tried. What you had was the greatest rate of speciation ever seen, but it was also\nthe greatest rate of extinction the planet has ever seen. I think that's exactly what you see\ngoing on here. Every experiment [on the Internet] is getting tried. Many of them are\ngoing to succeed, and many of them are going to fail.\u201d\n-Jeff Bezos2\nBiology\nWant to get a good sense of the boom/bust cycle in business? Gain some insight\ninto the recent Internet bubble? Our prescription is simple: set up an appointment\nwith your favorite paleontologist. As it turns out, there is a lot we can learn by\nstudying the fossil record, where increases in the number of species and\nsubsequent extinction are commonplace. In fact, this pattern provides an\nimportant lesson: Business, like biology, is a messy process. In the absence of\nthe \u201cgreat capital allocator in the sky\u201d, the path to long-term efficient capital\nallocation is littered with excesses and inefficiencies.\n3\nOne of the most vivid and well-documented examples of boom/bust in the\nevolutionary record is the Cambrian Era. What we know is that an enormous\nincrease in the biodiversity of life occurred roughly 550 million years ago\n(scientists still debate the exact enabling factor) followed by a large-scale\nextinction event. And this cycle of increasing diversity and extinction has\npersisted over the last half a billion years, resulting in dramatic evolutionary\nswings.\n4 Figure 1 shows the pattern of boom and bust during the Cambrian,\nillustrating an enormous increase in genera followed by high extinction.\nFigure 1\nSpeciation & Extinction\nCambrian Extinction\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\nGenera (Archaeocyatha)\n550\n525\n500\nGeologic Time (Cambrian 000,000 years)\nSource: A. Hallam & P.B. Wignall, \u201cMass Extinctions And Their Aftermath\u201d\nThe pattern plays out time and time again. Either an external force (e.g., change\nin the environment) or an autocatalytic process prompt an explosion in the\nnumber of biological forms.\n5 These new species fill a previously empty space\u2014\nthey are biological innovations.

It is undoubtedly a bit of both.\n7\nBusiness\nAs it turns out, the business record smacks of the paleontological record. An\nenabling, or general-purpose technology, comes along and spawns a period of\nsubstantial innovation. In turn, the different \u201cbody types\u201d compete and the less\neffective ones go out of business. The resulting pattern is a sharp upswing in the\nnumber of companies in the industry, following by a sharp downswing.\nThis pattern has played out over and over in the business world. Take two giants\nin the annals of American industry\u2014the automobile and television (see Figure 2).\nIn both cases investors allocated capital liberally in the early phases, as each\nindustry\u2019s growth potential was positive but uncertain. But both saw steep\ndeclines in the number of competing firms over time, especially when the industry\ngravitated around major design innovations.\n8\nFigure 2\nThe Decline of Firms\nU.S. Automobile Industry\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1890\n1900\n1910\n1920\n1930\n1940\n1950\n1960\n1970\nYear\nNumber of Firms\nU.S. Television Industry\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n1940\n1950\n1960\n1970\n1980\n1990\nYear\nNumber of Firms\nSource: James M.

This provides some hint about the\npotential success of those companies that survive. Figure 4 shows the same\nextinction patterns in Figure 3, but superimposed on industry sales figures.\nFigure 4\nThe Personal Computer and Disk Drive Industry\nPersonal Computer\n0\n2,000\n4,000\n6,000\n8,000\n10,000\n12,000\n14,000\n16,000\n1974\nYear\nRevenue\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nManufacturers\nRevenue\nFirms\nDisk Drive Industry\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\n30,000\n35,000\n1984\nYear\nRevenue\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nManufacturers\nRevenue\nFirms\n1978\n1982\n1986\n1990\n1988\n1992\n1996\nSource: DISK/TREND reports and Management Science.\nWith this pattern in mind, we turn to the Internet. The Internet, arguably the\ngreatest enabling technology that has come along, spawned a huge number of\n\u201cinventions\u201d\u2014most of them questionable. But in the business landscape just as\nthe biological landscape, it is difficult to know, a priori, which companies (species)\nwill succeed or fail. While \u201cinefficient\u201d, the biological and business solution is to try\nout lots of alternatives and see which ones survive.\nThe population of Internet companies is following the same pattern that we\u2019ve\nseen in industry time and time again. At the very least, 210 Internet companies\nfailed last year, with an additional 49 failing in January of 2001 (see Figure 5).\n10 If\nthis latest capital allocation cycle was indeed a mania\u2014as many observers\ncontend\u2014then it\u2019s a pattern that occurs consistently and often in American\neconomic history.\n 11 Investor sentiment has mirrored this phenomenon: the initial\neuphoria that surrounded the industry has yielded to the prevailing pessimism.\n"

To illustrate, Figure 6 shows the remarkable similarity in price to sales\nratios for the illustrated biotechnology and Internet indexes.\n12\nBoth industries had uncertain adoption rates and impact on their end markets. In\nthe early phases, every company seemed a potential winner, with large yet\nuncertain market growth. Only the time frame is different: it was 1990-1991 for\nthe biotechnology companies, and August 1999 to the present for the Internet\ncompanies.\nBoth indexes swooned as the industry\u2019s financial statements failed to show\ndemonstrable progress, dimming the initial tide of enthusiasm. The reality of the\ndrug discovery and distribution process sobered biotech investors, while Internet\nexpectations for Internet enthusiasts were tempered by the dubious traction of\nnew business models. However, for most investors the Internet \u201cmania\u201d is a more\nvivid example of excess not only because it was more recent, but also because\nits rise came faster and its fall came harder than previous boom/busts.\n"

However, at the end of the process a\nhandful of super competitors emerge, which continue to dominate the industry.\nFor example, both the disk drive and personal computer saw brutal competition\nas they matured, but the select few that managed to survive went on to create\nsatisfactory, if not significant, shareholder value.\n14\nLeading companies emerge from the crucible of intense competition equipped\nwith products and processes that can keep them a step ahead of their\ncompetition. These companies often prosper for many years following the critical\npoint in the industry shakeout.\nSurvivors\u2014Shareholder Benefit\nInvestors are wise to look around for survivors at the end of a bust, because it is\npossible to generate attractive shareholder returns by holding a portfolio of\nsurviving companies.\nFor instance, an investment in the twelve hard disk drive original equipment\nmanufacturers that survived at the beginning of 1985 (after the first drop-off in\ncompetitors), held until June of 2000, resulted in an annual compound return of\n11%. In 1994 many thought that disk drive companies were the untouchables of\nthe investment world.\n15 Although not a market beating performance, the stocks\nachieved the return despite the fact that only 25% of the 12 firms survived in their\noriginal form over the investment period!\n"

It is never truly in \u201cbalance\u201d\nbut is organized in a poised state \u2014the critical state\u2014 where nonlinear outcomes are the norm. Nonlinearity simply\nmeans that effect is not proportional to cause. Such a system is not optimal in terms of resource allocation, as evidenced\nby the sheer number of phyla that emerged during the Cambrian period. In similar fashion, the economy is a self-\norganizing system.\n6 See Biodiversity Dynamics by M. Mckinney and J. Drake, Columbia University Press, 1998.\n7 See \u201cSpecies, Speciation and the Environment,\u201d by Niles Eldredge:\nhttp://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/eldredge.html. Although not specifically addressed by Eldredge, one\ninteresting consequence of the self-organized criticality seen in nature is that catastrophes (including massive\nextinction) can occur for no reason whatsoever.\n8 Detroit began to manufacture all steel enclosed bodies and large color picture tubes were the catalyst for the demise of\nmany competitors in the television business.\n9 See \u201cInnovation and Markets,\u201d by Michael Mauboussin and Alex Schay, Credit Suisse First Boston, December, 2000.\n10 See Webmergers.com \u201cWebmergers Special Report IIX-Dot Com Shutdowns,\u201d January 3, 2001.\n11 See Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation by James M.
