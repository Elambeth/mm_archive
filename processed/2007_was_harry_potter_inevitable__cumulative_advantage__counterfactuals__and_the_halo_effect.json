Or is it? \n \nOur society often associates success with quality. In a fiercely competitive market, the thinking goes, \nonly the best products rise to the surface. Once a product is a hit, whether a blockbuster movie or a \nbestselling book, we readily point to the attributes that make it so appealing. And the stakes are high: \nstudies show a small minority of winners reap the vast majority of the sales. 3   \n \nThe link between success and quality is clear and legitimate in many domains. For example, consistent \ntournament winners in tennis or golf must have the skill to beat a large field of hungry challengers. But \nwhat happens if factors other than quality shape success? Might we draw the wrong lessons from the \nsuccesses and failures we see and make ill-informed decisions as a result? \n \nThree ideas, each individually underappreciated, inform the answers to these questions: \n \n\u2022 \nFirst is a failure of experts to predict winners in culturally driven products, including books, \nmusic, and movies. 4 Notwithstanding this, studios routinely sack their chiefs due to a lack of \nhits. 5  \n\u2022 \nSecond is counterfactual thinking, a careful consideration of what could have happened but \ndidn\u2019t.  \u201cWhat if\u201d questions are natural, but investors must use them with caution.  \n\u2022 \nThird is the halo effect, our proclivity to attach attributes to what has succeeded, solely because \nof the success. The halo effect creates substantial distortion in our thinking. 6 \n \nTaken together, these ideas can help investors think more critically about the past, present, and future \nand shed light on what is knowable and unknowable in specific domains. Notwithstanding the voices of \nsome critics, chances are Harry Potter is great. 7 But plenty of products, fashions, and ideas have \nsucceeded without being objectively meritorious. For market participants who see ideas come in and \nout of vogue, this observation is both disconcerting and potentially liberating. \n \nDon\u2019t Lock Down on \"Lockdown\" \n \nOurs is the only world we know. But it is tantalizing to ask whether the outcomes would be \ndifferent if we went back in time and replayed the tape. 8 While models of how people adopt ideas \nand innovations certainly suggest a role for serendipity, there is no way to test theories about \nwhat could have been. That is, until very recently.  \n \nIn a landmark study of social influence, a trio of Columbia University sociology researchers \nconducted a large-scale study of how people behave in a social setting. 9 One of the study\u2019s most \nimportant features is the creation of what are essentially separate worlds. We may not be able to \nreplay the tape of our world, but these researchers effectively created alternative worlds within \ntheir study. The findings give pause to anyone in the prediction business. \n \nHere\u2019s what they did. They created a website called Music Lab (see Exhibit 1) and invited \nsubjects to participate in a study of musical tastes. The site invited subjects to listen to 48 songs \nby unknown bands and to rate the songs. The subjects also had the option to download the \nsongs they liked. Over 14,000 people participated, and most of the subjects resided in the United \nStates and were younger than 25 years old. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

A top-five song in the independent \nworld had about a 50 percent chance of finishing in the top five for a social influence world. And \nthe worst songs rarely topped the charts. Beyond that, the scientists found social influence played \na huge part in success and failure. In the eight social worlds, the songs downloaded early in the \nexperiment affected the songs downloaded later. Since the patterns of download were different in \neach social world, so were the outcomes.  \n \nOne song, \"Lockdown\" by 52metro, illustrates the point. The tune was ranked 26 in quality in the \nindependent world, effectively average. Yet it was the number 1 song in one of the social \ninfluence worlds, and number 40 in another. Social influence catapulted an average song to hit \nstatus in one world and delegated it to the cellar in another. \n \nThe Polya urn process is a simple model that offers insight into how these varied outcomes \narise.10 Imagine a large urn with two balls inside, one red and one blue. You reach in and \nrandomly select a ball. Say you pick the blue one. You then introduce one matching blue ball and \nreturn both balls to the urn (the urn now contains one red ball and two blue balls). You repeat the \nprocess, randomly selecting a ball, matching, and replacing until the urn is full. You then calculate \nthe ratio of red to blue balls.  \n \nThe Polya urn process has features that fit nicely with Music Lab\u2019s results: \n \n\u2022 \nFor any individual trial run, you have no way to know the outcome ahead of time. The \nratio can be skewed toward red or blue, and multiple trials will likely yield different ratios.  \n\u2022 \nIn any one trial, the ratio moves toward equilibrium over time. Once the urn is nearly full, \nadding new balls does not change the ratio much. \n\u2022 \nThe early selections strongly influence the ultimate outcome. Even though the process is \nrandom, the luck of the initial draw is crucial. \n \nThe combination of the Music Lab experiment and the Polya urn process offers a few crucial \nlessons. First, it is really hard to predict winners. While it is true that better quality products have a \nbetter probability of success, there is no assured link between commercial success and quality. \nFurther, in the Music Lab experiment the inequality of outcomes was substantially greater in the \nsocial worlds than in the independent world, meaning social influence exacerbates product \nsuccesses and failures.  \n \nSecond, flexibility decreases over time. While the eventual outcomes were unclear early on in the \nMusic Lab experiment, the results were sticky once established. For the social worlds, the \noutcomes stabilized after about one-third of the subjects participated. \n \nFinally, there is a memory effect. The set of early downloads influences the pattern of later \ndownloads. Our world represents one of many possible outcomes, and small changes in initial \nconditions lead to a big difference in outcomes. A scan of the ranking differences in the various \nsocial influence worlds attests to this. \n \nTo be clear, the Polya urn process is too simple to fully represent the Music Lab experiment and \nmost social processes. 11 For example, the urn process is limited to two choices, while the \nexperiment and real world are vastly more complicated. But the urn process does show how \npositive feedback leads to lopsided, unpredictable outcomes. Social influence can be the engine \nfor positive feedback. \n \nImagining the role of social influence in other realms is not difficult. Researchers have \ndemonstrated the importance of cumulative advantage in the success of technologies, behaviors, \nand ideas. 12 Each realm faces the same lack of predictability and loose correlation between \nsuccess and quality. In cases where cause and effect are not clear, learning from history is a \nchallenge. \n \n \n \n"

Many historians, for \ninstance, believe that consideration of what could have been is outside their purview.   \n \nPsychologists, however, are more open to studying counterfactuals, if for no other reason than \nwe are all natural counterfactual thinkers. If something bad happens to us, we quickly consider \nhow things could have been better had we acted differently. For example, if you go out in the \nmorning without your umbrella and get caught in the rain, you immediately think you would have \nremained dry had you brought your umbrella. \n \nThe main challenge to counterfactual thinking is the issue of causality. In some situations, cause \nand effect is clear. You are wet because you didn\u2019t bring your umbrella. But in many social \nsystems, indeed in all complex adaptive systems, cause and effect are frequently difficult to link.16 \nSo considering what the world would look like if Kennedy hadn\u2019t been assassinated, or if the \nSoviet Union had won the Cold War, is inherently challenging and potentially nonproductive. 17  \n \nAs a result, historians are extremely careful about how they use counterfactuals. They only \nchange one variable at a time, holding others constant to preserve as much of the context as \npossible; they weigh only plausible actions; and they consider only the knowledge available to \ndecision makers at the time. Most decision makers are not so disciplined.  \n \nPsychologists distinguish between upward (things could have been better) and downward (things \ncould have been worse) counterfactuals. Upward counterfactuals are much more common in our \nday-to-day thoughts. Considering how different decisions would have led to better outcomes  \noften leads to regret (e.g., \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been speeding, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten the ticket\u201d). Less \nfrequently, we think of downward counterfactuals (e.g., \u201cThe wedding was more fun because the \nrain held off\u201d). Both counterfactual types are important for investors. \n \nPsychologists suggest counterfactual thinking serves two main purposes. The first is preparation \nfor the future. By considering alternatives to past actions and spurred by a feeling of regret, \nindividuals come up with prescriptions for future actions. Second, individuals use counterfactuals \nto help them feel better about a situation. In weighing a worse outcome, people feel better about \nthemselves. 18 \n \nClose calls and abnormal situations are particularly strong catalysts for counterfactual thinking. 19 \nIn a demonstration of the close-call phenomenon, subjects were asked to consider a case where \nMr. A and Mr. B share a taxi to the airport to catch two separate flights leaving at the same time. \nCaught in traffic, they arrive at the airport 30 minutes late and both miss their flights. The gate \nagents inform Mr. A that his flight left on time, and tell Mr. B his flight was delayed and he missed \nit by a few moments. Who is more upset? Subjects nearly unanimously felt Mr. B would be more \nupset, even though both men suffered the same plight. \n \nAbnormal situations also generate strong counterfactual thoughts. Indeed, abnormality \nsometimes leads observers to blame crime victims in cases where the victims were doing \nsomething outside their routine. In a test of the abnormality concept, researchers described the \ncase of Mr. C, who was involved in an accident while driving home along his normal route. Mr. D \ngot into a similar accident while driving home on an alternative route that offered better scenery. \nWho is more upset? Four to one, subjects believed Mr. D would be more upset. \n \nAwareness of counterfactual thinking can be very useful for investors, if only to illuminate \ncommon biases and errors. Here are some ideas investors may find useful: \n \nAvoid inaction inertia. Inaction inertia arises when an investor initially fails to take advantage of an \nattractive investment opportunity and subsequently passes over the same, albeit somewhat less \nattractive, opportunity in the future. 20 For example, an investor who considers but fails to buy a \n"

Experiments confirm this behavior. 21   \n \nPsychologists suggest individuals suffering from inaction inertia consider an upward \ncounterfactual (\u201cif only I had bought the stock at $15\u201d) and hence feel regret. Rejecting the \nsecond purchase opportunity, perceived as less attractive than the first, may limit or end that \nregret and allows the investor to avoid thinking about the initial lost opportunity. \n \nWhile economic theory emphasizes investors should evaluate all investments based on future \nprospects, inaction inertia demonstrates that we all tend to carry psychological baggage that may \nprevent proper decisions. Counterfactual thinking helps describe the baggage. \n \nErrors of action versus inaction. Counterfactual thinking often generates regret, which may seem \nlike a bad thing. But the research shows that some regret is good for you because it encourages \nfuture changes in behavior. Since most counterfactual thoughts focus on how you could have \navoided a problem, they encourage positive measures to sidestep similar problems going \nforward. When your mind is working well, you feel the sting of regret in the short-term and correct \nyour behavior the next time, and you\u2019re better off for the experience.  \n \nLingering regrets, on the other hand, are more troublesome. Psychologists have come to a \nfascinating finding: most of our short-term regrets relate to actions (commission), while our long-\nterm regrets relate to inaction (omission). When mentally healthy individuals make mistakes in \ntheir actions, they regret, change, and move on. In contrast, lingering regrets surround what \npeople failed to do. 22 Studies show the top two regrets of adult Americans are education (either \nnot enough of it or insufficient effort while pursuing it) and career (failure to pursue a passion or \nworking too hard).  23 \n \nWarren Buffett is a good example of the regret associated with inaction. When asked about his \nmain investing mistakes over time, Buffett points to inactions rather than actions. For instance, he \noften points to the stocks he almost bought and quantifies the profits that have escaped Berkshire \nHathaway due to his inaction. 24 \n     \nWhy do we regret the things we don\u2019t do more than the things we do? The answer leads to the \nnext point, which describes how our minds compensate for our poor actions.  \n \nPsychological immune system. Mentally healthy people employ a host of tricks to make bad \nsituations seem better. Psychologists have dubbed this the psychological immune system. 25 Just \nas our immune system fends off disease, the psychological immune system keeps us going by \ndefending against, and removing, negative thoughts. This mental immune system is most likely to \nkick in when we have an intense experience or find ourselves in inescapable circumstances.  \n \nWhat kind of things does our mind do? First, we tend to explain away situations in a way that \nmakes us feel better. For example, someone who fails to get a job offer after an interview may \nmake up a story to shed a more favorable light on the situation (e.g., \u201cThe interviewer didn\u2019t \nappreciate my skills\u201d).  \n \nNext, we seek facts that support our views and disavow or dismiss facts that don\u2019t back us up. \nThis is known as the confirmation bias. The confirmation bias allows us to be consistent in our \nviews and removes the need to think or act as the consequence of reason.  \n \nWe also exhibit hindsight bias. Once an event has passed, we tend to believe we had better \nknowledge of the outcome before the event than we actually did. For example, after a game is \nover, sports fans believe they assigned a higher probability to the game\u2019s outcome before the \ngame than they actually did. Hindsight bias is a memory update that makes us look and feel \nbetter, and confers an illusory sense of control.  \n \nFinally, when we make a prediction or take an action that doesn\u2019t work out, we believe we were \nalmost right\u2014the close-call counterfactual. 26 This effect is particularly acute for individuals who \n"

Both hindsight bias and close-call \ncounterfactuals bend reality to make individuals feel better. \n \nBeyond theory, researchers argue that counterfactual thinking can also explain a couple of \nempirically observed investor behaviors. 27 Importantly, neither behavior benefits investors.  \n \nThe first is a tendency to repurchase a stock that has declined following a prior sale for a profit. \nTo illustrate, the investor initially buys at $30 per share, sells at $50, and repurchases at $40. In \nthis case, the downward counterfactual is the investor could have held the stock throughout (net \ngain of $10 per share) versus the reality of a $20 gain and the opportunity to own the stock again. \nInvestors feel good about this counterfactual because no matter what happens, they can cherish \nthe thought that selling made them better off than holding. \n \nAnother tendency is for an investor to purchase additional shares of a stock when it goes down \nfollowing the initial purchase. The downward counterfactual here is buying the whole stake at the \nhigher price. For instance, the investor who buys 100 shares at $50 and an additional 100 shares \nat $40 is better off than the possible alternative of purchasing all 200 shares at $50.  \n \nSo what should an investor do with counterfactual thinking? To start, it is crucial to recognize the \nvalue of counterfactual thinking diminishes as causality becomes less clear. As we saw with \nMusic Lab, linking cause and effect can be difficult in socially driven processes. As company \nprospects and stock prices are often the result of these processes, predicting stock price \nperformance is inherently difficult.  \n \nNext, be aware of how the mind works and the suboptimal behaviors that may ensue. For \ninstance, inaction inertia may cause an investor to miss a very attractive investment opportunity \nbecause of an upward counterfactual.   \n \nFinally, be careful not to kid yourself. Hindsight bias and close-call counterfactual thinking may \nhelp preserve your belief system, but may not give you a clear view of the world. Research shows \nthat experts who use counterfactuals parsimoniously are better predictors. 28        \n \nIf It\u2019s Doing Well, It Must Be Good \n \nEvery now and then an idea comes along that is simple, powerful, ubiquitous, and yet poorly \nunderstood. The halo effect is such an idea.  \n \nFirst noted by psychologist Edward Thorndike over 80 years ago, the halo effect is the human \nproclivity to make specific inferences based on general impressions. 29 Thorndike found when \nsuperiors in the military were asked to rate their subordinate officers on specific qualities (e.g., \nintelligence, physique, leadership), the correlations between the qualities were impossibly high. In \neffect, the overall impression the officer made on his superior overwhelmed the details. \n \nPhil Rosenzweig\u2019s must-read book, The Halo Effect, shows this idea is alive and well in the \nbusiness world. Rosenzweig\u2019s basic point is simple: we tend to observe success, attach attributes \nto that success, and recommend others embrace these attributes to achieve their own success. \nManagement researchers frequently use substantial data to support their argument, which is all \nfor naught if they fall into the halo effect trap.  \n \nFor example, Rosenzweig suggests a company doing well will be praised for having \u201ca sound \nstrategy, a visionary leader, motivated employees, and excellent customer orientation, a vibrant \nculture, and so on.\u201d 30 But if the company\u2019s performance subsequently suffers, onlookers will \nconclude all of those features went wrong, when in reality nothing of the sort happened. Company \nperformance shapes perception. \n \nThe halo effect is important for investors for a couple of reasons. First, Rosenzweig shows in \ndevastating fashion that most of the thinking from best-selling business books falls prey to the \nhalo effect. These books are commercially successful, he suggests, because they tell managers \n"

The answer is close to 80 percent.  \n \nExhibit 3: Tradesports Contract of WMD (April \u2013 September, 2003) \n \n \nSource: Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz, \u201cPrediction Markets,\u201d Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 18, 2, Spring 2004, 107-126. \n \nNo political commentary is necessary to see the lesson from psychology, called hindsight bias and \nthe curse of knowledge. Once information has been revealed, we impose our knowledge as we \nevaluate past decisions. So we think we assigned higher probabilities to certain outcomes than we \nreally did, and we criticize decisions based on the outcomes we see versus the quality of the \ndecision process. \n \nTo properly evaluate past decisions, be mindful to recreate the available information as it existed, \navoiding polluting the decision audit with after-the-fact disclosure.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
