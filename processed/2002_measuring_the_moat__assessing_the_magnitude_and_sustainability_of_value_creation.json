Both are of prime interest to \ninvestors and corporate executives. \n\u2022 Sustainable value creation is rare. Competitive forces\u2014including innovation\u2014drive \nreturns toward the cost of capital. Investors should be careful about how much they \npay for future value creation.   \n\u2022 Warren Buffett consistently emphasizes that he wants to buy businesses with \nprospects for sustainable value creation. He suggests that buying a business is like \nbuying a castle surrounded by a moat\u2014a moat that he wants to be deep and wide to \nfend off all competition. According to Buffett, economic moats are almost never stable; \ncompetitive forces assure that they\u2019re either getting a little bit wider or a little bit \nnarrower every day. This report seeks to develop a systematic way to explain the \nfactors that determine a company\u2019s moat. \n\u2022 Companies and investors use competitive strategy analysis for two very different \npurposes. Companies try to generate returns above the cost of capital, while investors \ntry to anticipate revisions in expectations for financial performance that enable them to \nearn returns above their opportunity cost of capital. If a company\u2019s share price already \ncaptures its prospects for sustainable value creation, investors should expect to earn \na risk-adjusted market return. \n\u2022 Studies suggest that industry factors dictate about 10-20% of the variation of a firm\u2019s \neconomic profitability, and that firm-specific effects represent another 20-40%. So a \nfirm\u2019s strategic positioning has a significant influence on the long-term level of its \neconomic profits. \n\u2022 Industry analysis is the appropriate place to start an investigation into sustainable \nvalue creation. We recommend getting a lay of the land\u2014understanding the players, a \nreview of profit pools, and industry stability\u2014followed by a five-forces analysis and an \nassessment of the likelihood of disruptive technologies.  \n\u2022 A clear understanding of how a company creates shareholder value is core to \nunderstanding sustainable value creation. We define three broad sources of added \nvalue: production advantages, consumer advantages, and external (i.e., government) \nadvantages. \n\u2022 How firms interact with one another plays an important role in shaping sustainable \nvalue creation. We not only consider how companies interact with their competitors \nthrough game theory, but also how companies can co-evolve as complementors. \n\u2022 Brands do not confer competitive advantage in and of themselves. Brands only add \nvalue if they increase customer willingness to pay or if they reduce the cost to provide \nthe good or service.   \n\u2022 We provide a complete checklist of questions to guide the strategic analysis (see \nAppendix A). \n"

      "text": "Measuring the Moat \n16 December 2002 \n \n3 \n \n \nIntroduction \nIdeally, corporate managers try to allocate resources so as to generate attractive long-\nterm returns on investment. Similarly, investors try to buy the stocks of companies that \nare likely to exceed embedded financial expectations. In both cases, sustainable value \ncreation is of prime interest.  \nWhat exactly is sustainable value creation? We can think of it across two dimensions. \nFirst is the magnitude of returns in excess of the cost of capital that a company can, or \nwill, generate. Magnitude considers not only the return on investment but also how \nmuch a company can invest at an above-cost-of-capital rate. Corporate growth only \ncreates value when a company generates returns on investment that exceed the cost of \ncapital. \nThe second dimension of sustainable value creation is how long a company can earn \nreturns in excess of the cost of capital. This concept is also known as fade rate, \ncompetitive advantage period (CAP), value growth duration, and T.1 Despite the \nunquestionable significance of this longevity dimension, researchers and investors give \nit scant attention. \nHow does sustainable value creation differ from the more popular sustainable \ncompetitive advantage? A company must have two characteristics to claim that it has a \ncompetitive advantage. The first is that it must generate, or have an ability to generate, \nreturns in excess of the cost of capital. Second, the company must earn a higher rate of \neconomic profit than the average of its competitors.2 \nAs our focus is on sustainable value creation, we want to understand a company\u2019s \neconomic performance relative to the cost of capital, not relative to its competitors \n(although these are intimately linked, as we will see). If sustainable value creation is \nrare, then sustainable competitive advantage is even more rare, given that it requires a \ncompany to perform better than its peers. \nWe can visualize sustainable value creation by looking at a company\u2019s competitive life \ncycle. (See Exhibit 1.) Companies are generally in one of four phases (see Appendix B \nfor a breakdown by industry): \n\u2022 \nInnovation. Young companies typically see sharp increases in return on \ninvestment and significant investment opportunities. This is a period of rising \nreturns and heavy investment. \n\u2022 \nFading returns. High returns attract competition, generally causing economic \nreturns to gravitate toward the cost of capital. In this phase, companies still earn \nexcess returns, but the return trajectory is down, not up. Investment needs also \nmoderate. \n\u2022 \nMature. In this phase, the product markets are in competitive equilibrium. As a \nresult, companies here earn their cost of capital on average, but competition \nwithin the industry assures that aggregate returns are no higher. Investment \nneeds continue to moderate. \n\u2022 \nSubpar. Competitive forces often drive returns below the cost of capital, \nrequiring companies to restructure. These companies often improve returns by \nshedding assets, shifting their business model, reducing investment levels, or \nputting themselves up for sale. Alternatively, these companies can distribute \ntheir assets through a bankruptcy filing. \n"

This theme is based on \nmicroeconomic theory and is quite intuitive. It predicts that companies generating high \neconomic returns will attract competitors willing to take a lesser, albeit still attractive, \nreturn which will drive down aggregate industry returns to the opportunity cost of capital. \nResearchers have empirically documented this prediction.3 To achieve sustainable \nvalue creation, companies must defy the very powerful force of reversion to the mean. \nRecent research on the rate of mean reversion reveals a couple of important points. \nFirst, the time that an average company can sustain excess returns is shrinking.4 This \nreduction in sustainable value creation reflects the greater pace of innovation and a shift \nin the composition of public companies (i.e., today there are more young public \ncompanies than 25 years ago). Second, reinvestment rates and the variability of \neconomic returns help explain the rate of fade.5 For example, a company that generates \nhigh returns while investing heavily signals an attractive opportunity to both existent and \npotential competitors. Success sows the seeds of competition. \nWhy is sustainable value creation so important for investors? To start, investors pay for \nvalue creation. Exhibit 2 provides a very simple proxy for how much value creation \ninvestors have anticipated for the S&P 500 since 1980. We establish a baseline value \nby simply capitalizing the last four quarters of operating net income for the S&P 500 by \nan estimate of the cost of equity capital.6 We attribute any value above and beyond this \nbaseline value to future expected value creation. The exhibit shows that over one-third \nof the value of the S&P 500 reflects anticipated value creation, a ratio that has \nincreased in recent decades. \n"

At this point, we must draw a critical distinction between product \nmarkets\u2014the markets for the goods and services that companies produce\u2014and capital \nmarkets. Companies seek to understand the industry and competitive landscape so as \nto make decisions and allocate resources in a way that maximizes long-term economic \nprofits. In contrast, investors seek to understand whether or not the expectations \nreflected in today\u2019s price are likely to be revised up or down. \nSo companies and investors both use competitive strategy analysis, but for two very \ndifferent purposes. Companies try to generate returns above the cost of capital, while \ninvestors try to anticipate revisions in expectations. If a company\u2019s share price already \ncaptures its prospects for sustainable value creation, investors should expect to earn a \nrisk-adjusted market return.7 \nWe will spend most of our time trying to understand how and why companies attain \nsustainable value creation in product markets. But we should never lose sight of the fact \nthat our goal as investors is to anticipate expectations revisions. Exhibit 3 shows the \nprocess and emphasizes the goal of finding and exploiting expectations mismatches. \n"

Note that we are not \nasking what determines a company\u2019s share price performance (which we know is a \nfunction of expectations revisions), but rather its economic profitability.9 \nBefore we answer the question, we can make some empirical observations. Exhibit 4 \nshows the spread between cash flow return on investment and the cost of capital for \nover 90 industries in the United States. Our sample includes in excess of 1,500 \ncompanies. We see that some industries have positive economic return spreads, some \nare neutral, and some don\u2019t earn the cost of capital. \nExhibit 4: Industry Returns Vary from Value-Creating to Value-Destroying \n(15.00)\n(10.00)\n(5.00)\n0.00\n5.00\n10.00\n15.00\n20.00\nReturns minus Opportunity Cost\nSource: CSFB HOLT estimates. \nNext, we analyze the companies that make up a value-creating industry (Exhibit 5), a \nvalue-neutral industry (Exhibit 6), and a value-destroying industry (Exhibit 7). The \nimportant observation is that even the best industries include value-destroying \ncompanies, while the worst industries have value-creating companies. That some \ncompanies buck the economics of their industry provides some insight about potential \nsources of economic performance. \n"

Porter, Competitive Strategy (New York: The Free Press, 1980), 4. \nWhile analysts often treat Porter\u2019s five forces with equal emphasis, we believe that two \nof them\u2014threat of entry and rivalry\u2014are so important that they warrant special, in-depth \ntreatment. Further, our firm-specific analysis will make a finer point on some of the other \nforces. But for now, here\u2019s a quick look at supplier power, buyer power, and substitution \nthreat:13 \n\u2022 \nSupplier power is the degree of leverage a supplier has with its customers in \nareas like price, quality, and service. An industry that cannot pass on to its \ncustomers price increases from its powerful suppliers is destined to be \nunattractive. Suppliers are well positioned if they are more concentrated than \nthe industry they sell to, if substitute products do not burden them, or if their \nproducts have significant switching costs. They are also in a good position if the \nindustry they serve represents a relatively small percentage of their sales \nvolume, or if the product is critical to the buyer. Sellers of commodity goods to a \nconcentrated number of buyers are in a much more difficult position than sellers \nof differentiated products to a diverse buyer base. \n\u2022 \nBuyer power is the bargaining strength of the buyers of a product or service. It is \na function of buyer concentration, switching costs, levels of information, \nsubstitute products, and the offering\u2019s importance to the buyer. Informed, large \nbuyers have much more leverage over their suppliers than do uninformed, \ndiffused buyers. \n"

Substitute products limit \nthe prices that companies can charge, placing a ceiling on potential returns. \nBarriers to entry is arguably the most important of Porter\u2019s five forces. Before we delve \ninto the factors that help determine impediments to entry, we believe it is worthwhile to \nreview the empirical research on entry and exit.  \nTimothy Dunne, Mark Roberts, and Larry Samuelson (DRS) did the most widely cited \nstudy of entry and exit rates.14 DRS studied in excess of 250,000 U.S. manufacturing \nfirms over a 20-year span ended in the early 1980s. \nA fascinating way to summarize the DRS findings is to imagine a hypothetical industry in \nthe year 2002 that has 100 firms with sales of $1 million each. If the historical patterns \nof entry and exit in U.S. industries held true, the following would be true:15 \n\u2022 \nEntry and exit will be pervasive. After five years, between 30 and 40 new firms \nwill have entered the industry, and will have combined annual sales of $12-20 \nmillion. Half of these entrants will be diversified firms competing in other \nmarkets, and half new firms. Simultaneously, 30 to 40 firms with aggregate \nsales of $12-20 million will leave the industry. So the industry will experience a \n30-40% turnover in firms, with the entering and exiting firms representing 12-\n20% of the industry\u2019s volume.  \n\u2022 \nCompanies entering and exiting tend to be smaller than the established firms. A \ntypical entrant is only about one-third the size of an incumbent, with the \nexception of diversifying firms that build new plants. These diversifying firms, \nwhich represent less than 10% of total new entrants, tend to be the same size \nas the incumbents. \n\u2022 \nMost entrants do not survive ten years, but those that do thrive. Of the 30 to 40 \nfirms that enter between 2002 and 2007, roughly 60% will exit by 2012. But the \nsurvivors will nearly double their size by 2012. \n\u2022 \nEntry and exit rates vary substantially by industry. DRS research shows that low \nbarriers to entry and low barriers to exit tend to go together \nYou should first review the history of entry and exit in an industry. If there has been a lot \nof entry and exit\u2014suggesting entry and exit barriers are low\u2014 sustainable value \ncreation will be elusive.  \nBut what influences the entry decision in the first place? On a broad level, potential \nentrants weigh the expected incumbent reactions, the anticipated payoff size, and the \nmagnitude of exit costs. We\u2019ll explore each of these in more detail.16 \nLet\u2019s first take a look at the expectations of incumbent reaction to a potential new entry. \nFour specific factors indicate the likely veracity of incumbent reaction: asset specificity, \nthe level of the minimum efficient production scale, excess capacity, and incumbent \nreputation. \nFor a long time, economists thought that a firm\u2019s commitment to a market was a function \nof the amount of assets it had dedicated to the market. More recently, though, \neconomists have realized it\u2019s not the amount of assets that matters, but rather the \n"

If a firm\u2019s assets are only \nvaluable in a specific market, that firm is likely to fight harder to maintain its position. \nA classic illustration is a railroad versus an airline. Say a company builds a railroad track \nfrom New York to Chicago. That asset can only be used for one thing: to move a train \nback and forth between those two cities. That firm, as a result, will go to great lengths to \nprotect its position.17 Now consider an airline that has a flight from New York to Chicago. \nIf that route proves uneconomic for any reason, the airline can reroute that plane. \nAsset specificity can take a number of forms, including site (assets located next to one \nanother for efficiency); physical (assets tailored to a specific transaction); dedicated \n(assets that satisfy a particular buyer); and human (workers that develop skills, \nknowledge, or know-how).18 \nThe next factor is production scale. For many industries, especially high-fixed-cost \nindustries, unit costs decline as output rises\u2014to a point. A firm enjoys economies of \nscale when its unit costs decline as the result of its volume gains. At some point, \nhowever, companies no longer see lower unit costs with incremental output (constant \nreturns to scale). The minimum efficient scale of production is the smallest amount of \nvolume a company must produce to minimize its unit costs. \nThe minimum efficient scale of production tells a potential entrant what market share it \nmust gain to be able to price its goods competitively. It also sizes an entrant\u2019s upfront \ncapital commitment. So when the minimum efficient scale of production is high relative \nto the size of the total market, a potential entrant is looking at the not-so-enticing \nprospects of having to price its products way below its average cost for some time just \nto get to scale. And the steeper the decline in the cost curve, the less likely the entry. \nThe main way an entrant can try to offset its production cost disadvantage is to \ndifferentiate its product, allowing the firm to charge a price premium versus the rest of \nthe industry. \nExhibit 14: Minimum Efficient Scale as a Barrier to Entry \nCost per unit\nAverage\nCost\nQ\nOutput\nMinimum\nEfficient\nScale\nCost per unit\nAverage\nCost\nQ\nOutput\nMinimum\nEfficient\nScale\n \nSource: Sharon M.

      "text": "Measuring the Moat \n16 December 2002 \n \n21 \n \nA third factor in weighing incumbent reaction is excess capacity. The logic here is quite \nstraightforward. Assuming that demand remains stable, an entrant that comes into an \nindustry with too much capacity increases the excess capacity of each of the \nincumbents. If the industry has economies of scale in production, the cost of idle \ncapacity rises. As a result, incumbents work hard to maintain their market share. So a \nnew entrant will spur a drop in prices. This prospect deters entry. \nThe final factor is incumbent reputation. Firms usually compete across various markets \nover an extended time. As a result, they gain reputations as being tough\u2014ready to fight \nat the least provocation\u2014or as more accommodating. A firm\u2019s reputation, readily \nbacked by actions as well as words, can seriously color an entrant\u2019s decision. \nAnother important shaper of barriers to entry is the magnitude of the entrant\u2019s \nanticipated payoff. There is no assurance that an entrant will capture attractive \neconomic profits if the incumbent has a sufficient advantage. Incumbent advantages \ncome in a number of forms, including precommitment contracts, licenses and patents, \nlearning curve benefits, and network effects. \nThe first incumbent advantage is precommitment contracts. Often, companies secure \nimportant future transactions using long-term contracts. These contracts are often \nefficient and reduce a company\u2019s search costs. An incumbent with a contract in place is \ndaunting for a potential entrant. \nPrecommitment contracts can take a number of forms. One is if an incumbent has \nfavorable access to an essential raw material. For example, after World War II \naluminum producer Alcoa (AA, $23.25, Outperform, $29.40) signed exclusive contracts \nwith all of the producers of high-grade bauxite, a key material in aluminum production. \nPotential entrants were deterred by an inability to access bauxite on the same favorable \nterms as Alcoa. \nAnother form of precommitment contract is a long-term deal with customers. In the mid-\n1980s, there were two producers of the sweetener aspartame, Monsanto (NutraSweet) \nand Holland Sweetener Company. Following the 1987 patent expiration of aspartame in \nEurope, Holland entered that market. The competition did drive down the price of \naspartame 60%, but Holland lost money. Holland Sweetener had its eye on the U.S. \nmarket, where patent expiration was set for 1992. But in a classic precommitment move, \nMonsanto signed long-term contracts to supply both Coca-Cola (KO, $45.87, \nOutperform, $57.00) and PepsiCo (PEP, $43.18, Neutral, $43.00), effectively shutting \nHolland out of the U.S.19 \nPrecommitment can also include quasi-contracts, like a pledge to always provide a good \nor service at the lowest cost. Since new entrants rarely have the scale to compete with \nincumbents, such pledges, if credible, deter entry. \nLicenses and patents also shape a potential entrant\u2019s payoff for common-sense \nreasons. A number of industries require a license or certification from the government to \ndo business. Acquiring licenses or certifications is costly, hence creating a barrier for an \nentrant. \nPatents are also an important entry barrier. But the spirit of a patent is somewhat \ndifferent than that of a license. The intent of a patent is to allow the innovator to receive \nan appropriate return on investment. Most innovations require substantial upfront costs. \nSo a free-market system needs a means to compensate innovators to encourage their \nactivities. Patents do not discourage innovation, but they do deter entry for a limited time \ninto protected activities. \n"

      "text": "Measuring the Moat \n16 December 2002 \n \n22 \n \nLearning curves can also serve as a barrier to entry. The learning curve refers to an \nability to reduce unit costs as a function of cumulative experience. Researchers have \nstudied the learning curve for hundreds of products. The data show that for the median \nfirm, a doubling of cumulative output reduces unit costs by about 20%.20 A company can \nenjoy learning curve benefits without enjoying economies of scale, and vice versa. But \nfrequently, the two go hand in hand. \nAnother important incumbent advantage that can weigh on an entrant\u2019s payoff is \nnetwork effects. Network effects exist when the value of a product or service increases \nas more members use that product. As an example, online auctioneer eBay (EBAY, \n$68.73, Outperform, $80.00) is attractive to the user precisely because so many buyers \nand sellers congregate there. In a particular category, positive feedback often assures \nthat one network becomes dominant: eBay has not only weathered competitive \nonslaughts, but has also strengthened its position. These winner-take-most markets \ndeter entry.21 \nThe last point, to reiterate a point from DRS\u2019s analysis of entry and exit, is that a link \nexists between barriers to entry and barriers to exit. High exit costs discourage entry. \nThe magnitude of investment an entrant requires and the specificity of the assets \ngenerally defines exit barriers. Low investment needs and general assets are consistent \nwith low barriers to entry. \nSo how do companies actually deter entry? Robert Smiley surveyed product managers \nabout their strategies.22 While his sample was limited to consumer products companies, \nand there may be other biases in the sample, the results are instructive nonetheless. \n(See Exhibit 15.) The first three strategies\u2014learning curve, advertising, and \nR&D/patents\u2014create high entry costs. The last three\u2014reputation, limit pricing, and \nexcess capacity\u2014shape judgments of post-entry payoffs. Virtually all managers \nreported use of one or more entry-deterring strategies. \nExhibit 15: Reported Use of Entry-Deterring Strategy \nLearning\nCurve\nAdvertising\nR&D/\nPatents\nReputation\nLimit\nPricing\nExcess\nCapacity\nNew Products\nFrequently\nOccasionally\nSeldom\nExisting Products\nFrequently\nOccasionally\nSeldom\n26%\n29\n45\n62%\n16\n22\n52%\n26\n21\n56%\n15\n29\n31%\n16\n54\n27%\n27\n47\n27%\n22\n52\n8%\n19\n73\n21%\n21\n58\n22%\n20\n48\n21%\n17\n62\nLearning\nCurve\nAdvertising\nR&D/\nPatents\nReputation\nLimit\nPricing\nExcess\nCapacity\nNew Products\nFrequently\nOccasionally\nSeldom\nExisting Products\nFrequently\nOccasionally\nSeldom\n26%\n29\n45\n62%\n16\n22\n52%\n26\n21\n56%\n15\n29\n31%\n16\n54\n27%\n27\n47\n27%\n22\n52\n8%\n19\n73\n21%\n21\n58\n22%\n20\n48\n21%\n17\n62\nSource: Robert Smiley, \u201cEmpirical Evidence on Strategic Entry Deterrence\u201d, International Journal of Industrial \nOrganization, Vol. 6, June 1988, 172. \nRivalry among firms addresses how fiercely companies compete with one another along \ndimensions such as price, service, new-product introductions, and advertising.

Intense rivalry makes it difficult for firms to generate \nhigh returns. \nCoordination is difficult if there are lots of competitors. In this case, each firm considers \nitself a minor player and is more likely to think individualistically.

To reinforce this point, empirical studies show that most of the price-fixing \ncases that the government prosecutes involve industries with fewer-than-average \nfirms.23 \nTaking this analysis one step further, it\u2019s not only the number of firms that matter, but \nalso the size distribution of those firms. A dominant firm in an otherwise fragmented \nindustry may be able to impose discipline on the other firms. In industries with several \nsimilar-size firms, rivalry tends to be significant. \nA widely used measure of industry balance is the Herfindahl-Hirschman index.

In these industries, companies often add too much capacity at points of peak \ndemand.

The condition of variable demand and \nhigh fixed costs describes many commodity industries, which is why their rivalry is so \nbitter and consistent excess economic returns are so rare. \nA final consideration in rivalry is industry growth. When the pie of potential excess \neconomic profits grows, companies can create shareholder value without undermining \ntheir competitors. The game is not zero-sum. In contrast, stagnant industries are zero-\nsum games, and the only way to increase value is to take it from others. So a \ndecelerating industry growth rate is often concomitant with a rise in rivalry. \nDisruption and Disintegration \nWhile the strategy literature has historically been effective at identifying the \ndeterminants of industry attractiveness, it has been lacking in its treatment of the \ninnovation process. In recent years, Clayton Christensen\u2019s disruptive technology \nframework has filled that gap. Christensen\u2019s work exposes a pattern by which great \ncompanies fail and new innovations take hold. Ironically, he notes that many companies \nfail to retain their leadership positions, even though great managers are making sound \ndecisions based on widely accepted management principles.24 \nChristensen starts by distinguishing between sustaining and disruptive technologies. \nSustaining technologies foster product improvement. They can be incremental, \ndiscontinuous, or even radical. But sustaining technologies operate within a defined \nvalue network\u2014the \u201ccontext within which a firm identifies and responds to customers\u2019 \nneeds, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors, and strives for profit.\u201d 25  \nIn direct contrast, disruptive technologies offer the market a very different value \nproposition. Products based on disruptive technologies may initially appeal only to \nrelatively few customers who value features such as low price, smaller size, or greater \nconvenience. Furthermore, Christensen finds that these technologies generally \nunderperform established products in the near term.  \nFor example, the personal computer disrupted the minicomputer in the early 1980s. But \na minicomputer user couldn\u2019t switch to a PC, because a PC wasn\u2019t good enough to \nsupport the necessary applications when it was first launched. Thus it is not surprising \nthat leading companies (like Digital Equipment in the case of the PC) often overlook, \nignore, or dismiss disruptive technologies in the early phases of the technology. \nTechnologies often progress faster than the market demands. (See Exhibit 18.) \nEstablished companies commonly provide customers with more than they need or more \nthan they are ultimately willing to pay for. This allows disruptive technologies to emerge, \nbecause even if they do not meet the demands of users today, they could become fully \nperformance-competitive tomorrow. \n"

Christensen, The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1997), \nxvi. \nPassing over disruptive technologies may appear rational for established companies, \nbecause disruptive products generally offer low margins, operate in insignificant or \nemerging markets, and are not in demand by the company\u2019s most profitable customers. \nAs a result, companies that listen to their customers and practice conventional financial \ndiscipline are apt to disregard disruptive technologies. \nThe disruptive technology framework offers other important insights as well. The first is \nthat when the performance of a sustaining technology exceeds the high end of the \nconsumer\u2019s threshold, it not only allows for the emergence of disruptive technology, but \nalso shifts the basis of competition away from performance toward speed-to-market and \ndelivery flexibility.26 So the basis of competition in the more traditional segments of a \nmarket could change quite significantly. An analysis of the personal computer industry \nreveals that as performance became less important, business models based on delivery \nefficiency became more prominent. Dell was ideally positioned to take advantage of this \nshift. \nAnother critical insight is that while industries are developing (i.e., while they are at the \nlow end of the required performance band), vertically integrated firms tend to dominate \nbecause of the high coordination costs. Examples include automobiles and computers. \nBut as the industry approaches the point where product performance outstrips \nconsumer demand, the industry tends to standardize and \u201cdis-integrate\u201d into horizontal \nsegments. (See Exhibit 19.) Christensen\u2019s work offers a useful way to understand and \nanticipate when an industry is likely to flip from vertical to horizontal. Further, \nChristensen argues that as the industry migrates from vertical to horizontal, the value \noften migrates to the suppliers. \n"

      "text": "Measuring the Moat \n16 December 2002 \n \n28 \n \n \nFirm-Specific Analysis \nCore to understanding sustainable value creation is a clear understanding of how a \ncompany creates shareholder value. A company\u2019s ability to create value is a function of \nthe strategies it pursues, as well as how it chooses to interact with competitors and \nimportant noncompetitors. \nWe first provide a fundamental framework for value creation. We then consider the \nvarious ways a company can add value. Finally, we delve into firm interaction using \ngame theory and principles of co-evolution. \nA Framework for Added-Value Analysis \nAdam Brandenburger and Harbourne Stuart offer a very concrete and sound definition \nof how a firm adds value.27 Their equation is deceptively simple: \nValue created = willingness-to-pay of the buyer \u2013 opportunity cost of the supplier \nThe equation basically says that the value a company creates is the difference between \nwhat it gets for its product or service and what it costs to produce that product (including \nthe opportunity cost of capital). The key to the equation is thinking through what the \nterms mean. \nLet\u2019s start with willingness to pay. Imagine that someone handed you a brand new \ntennis racket. Clearly, that would be good for you. Now imagine that the same person \nstarted withdrawing money from you bank account, starting with small sums. The \namount of money at which you are indifferent to having the racket or having the cash is \nthe definition of willingness to pay. \nThe flip side describes opportunity cost. A firm takes some resources away from its \nsupplier. Opportunity cost is the cash amount that makes the supplier perceive the new \nsituation (cash) as equivalent to the old situation (resources). \nBrandenburger and Stuart then go on to define four simple strategies to create more \nvalue: increase the willingness to pay of your customers; reduce the willingness to pay \nof your competitors; reduce the opportunity cost of your suppliers; and increase the \nopportunity cost of suppliers to your competitors. This framework also fits well with \nPorter\u2019s generic strategies to achieve competitive advantage\u2014low-cost producer \n(production advantage) and differentiation (consumer advantage). \nBrandenburger teamed up with colleague Barry Nalebuff to create what they call a \n\u201cvalue net.\u201d 28 We present the value net slightly differently than the authors do, but the \ncomponents and configuration are identical. (See Exhibit 20.) On the left are the firm\u2019s \nsuppliers. On the right are the firm\u2019s customers. Between the suppliers and customers \nare the company, its competitors, and its complementors\u2014a term we will define in much \nmore detail below. For now, the point is that companies beyond a firm\u2019s suppliers, \ncustomers, and competitors can affect the amount of added value that it can capture. \n"

Brandenburger and Barry J. Nalebuff, Co-opetition (New York: Doubleday, \n1996), 17. \nThe value net fits comfortably into Michael Porter\u2019s traditional five-forces and value-\nchain analysis, but adds an important element: Strategy is not only about risk and \ndownside, it\u2019s also about opportunity and upside. Industrial organization economics has \nhistorically stressed non-cooperative game theory, a reasonable framework in well-\nestablished industries near product price equilibrium. In contrast, cooperative game \ntheory recognizes that many industries are more dynamic and offer opportunities to \ncooperate as well as to compete. \nSources of Added Value \nWe can define three broad sources for added value: production advantages, consumer \nadvantages, and external (i.e., government) issues. Note that there is substantial \noverlap between this analysis and the industry analysis, but here we are zooming in on \nthe firm. \nFirms with production advantages create value by delivering products that have a larger \nspread between perceived consumer benefit and cost than their competitors, primarily \nby outperforming them on the cost side. We distill production advantages into two parts: \nprocess and scale economies. \nHere are some issues to think through to determine whether or not a firm has a process \nadvantage: \n\u2022 \nIndivisibility. Economies of scale are particularly important in high-fixed-cost \nbusinesses. Fixed costs are associated with indivisibility in the production \nprocess. Indivisibility means that a company can\u2019t scale down its production \ncosts beyond a minimum level even if output is low. Bakery distribution routes \nare an example. If a bakery wants to service a region, it must have a bakery, \ntrucks, and drivers. These parts are indivisible, and a firm must bear their cost \nno matter what bread demand looks like. At the same time, if the trucks go from \nhalf to completely full, fixed costs don\u2019t change much. \n"

      "text": "Measuring the Moat \n16 December 2002 \n \n30 \n \n\u2022 \nComplexity. Simple processes are easy to imitate and are unlikely to be a \nsource of advantage. More complex processes, in contrast, require more know-\nhow or coordination capabilities and can be a source of advantage. For \nexample, Gillette spent over $200 million to develop the Sensor shaving system. \nMost of the spending went to technology breakthroughs, and the company \nearned 29 patents to protect the process.  \n\u2022 \nRate of change in process cost. For some industries, the production costs \ndecline over time as a result of technological advances. For example, the \nprocess-related cost of building a distribution company today is less than in the \npast because of technology, but the cost in the future is likely to be lower than \ntoday for the same reason. For industries with declining process costs, the \nincumbent has learning curve advantages while the challenger has the \nadvantage of potentially lower future cost. So the analysis must focus on the \ntrade-off between learning advantages and future cost advantages. \n\u2022 \nProtection. Look for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and operating rights that \nprotect a firm\u2019s process. Research suggests that patent-protected products as a \ngroup generated higher economic returns than any single industry.29 \n\u2022 \nResource uniqueness. The example of Alcoa\u2019s bauxite contract is a good \nillustration of access to a unique resource. \nEconomies of scale are the second category of potential production advantage. We start \nby noting that economies of scale are hard to achieve, and the bigger the domain, the \nharder it is. For example, global economies of scale are significantly more difficult to \nattain than regional economies of scale. \nMcKinsey analysis suggests that currently about one-third of all industries are global, \none-third are national, and one-third are regional. (See Exhibit 21.) Their analysis also \nsuggests that industries are becoming increasingly global over time. Since global scale \neconomies are hard to achieve the implication is that sustainable value creation is, and \nwill continue to be, hard to achieve as well. \n"

Does the firm have local, regional, or national distribution scale? \nWe would note that very few firms have national distribution scale. Most \nbusinesses have, at best, regional distribution advantages. One good example \nis retail. Wal-Mart (WMT, $51.38, Outperform, $65.00) built its business in the \n1970s and 1980s through regional distribution advantages. Most retailers have \nonly regional advantages, and often fail to generate economic profitability \noutside their core markets. \nOne useful way to assess distribution strength is to look at the firm\u2019s operations \nand revenues on a map. Firms likely have some advantages where assets and \nrevenue are clustered. \n\u2022 \nPurchasing. Some firms can purchase raw materials at lower prices as the \nresult of scale. For instance, Home Depot (HD, $27.29, Outperform, $40.00) \nwas able to tack over 200 basis points on to its gross margins in the late 1990s. \nThe company attributed its margin expansion to a lower cost of merchandising \nresulting from product line reviews and increased sales of imported products.

Increasingly, large firms are lowering their supplier\u2019s opportunity cost \nby providing the supplier with better information about demand. \n\u2022 \nResearch and development. Economies of scope, related to economies of \nscale, exist when a company lowers its unit costs as it pursues a variety of \nactivities. A significant example is research-and-development spillovers, in \nwhich the ideas that arise in one research project transfer to other projects. \nCompanies that increase the diversification of their research portfolios can often \nfind applications for their ideas better than they could when their research \nportfolios were smaller.30 \n\u2022 \nAdvertising. The advertising cost per consumer for a product is a function of the \ncost per consumer of sending the message and the reach. If the fixed costs in \nadvertising (e.g., ad preparation, negotiating with the broadcaster) are roughly \nthe same for small and large companies, the larger company will have a cost \nper potential consumer advantage because it can spread its costs over a much \nlarger base. \nEven if two companies can advertise on a national scale, the larger one has an \nadvantage. Say both McDonald\u2019s (MCD, $17.40, Neutral, $21.00) and Wendy\u2019s \n(WEN, $28.18, Outperform, $40.00) have equally effective national advertising \ncampaigns. That McDonald\u2019s has many more stores than Wendy\u2019s lowers \nMcDonald\u2019s per store advertising cost, giving it an advantage. \nIf you suspect a firm has production advantages, carefully think through why its costs \nare relatively lower than its competitors. Also, practical experience suggests that firms \nwith production advantages often have lower gross margins than companies with \nconsumer advantages. \nConsumer advantage is the second broad source of added-value. Firms with consumer \nadvantages also create value by delivering products that have a larger spread between \nperceived consumer benefit and cost than its competitors, but it does that primarily by \noutperforming competitors on the benefit side. \nHere are some characteristic features of companies with consumer advantages:31 \n\u2022 \nHabit and high horizontal differentiation. A product is horizontally differentiated \nwhen some consumers prefer it to competing products. This source of \nadvantage is particularly significant if consumers use the product habitually. The \nproduct need not be unambiguously better than competing products, it just has \nfeatures that some consumers find attractive, and other consumers may not. \nSoft drinks are an example. Competing with Coca-Cola is hard because many \nconsumers habitually drink Coke and are fiercely attached to the product. 32  \n\u2022 \nExperience goods. An experience good is a product that consumers can assess \nonly when they\u2019ve tried it. Search goods, in contrast, are products that a \nconsumer can easily assess at the time of purchase (e.g., hockey pucks or \noffice furniture). With experience goods, a company can enjoy differentiation \nbased on image, reputation, or credibility. Experience goods are often \ntechnologically complex. \n\u2022 \nHigh switching costs (lock-in). Customers must bear costs when they switch \nfrom one information system to another.

Game theory forces \nmanagers to put themselves in the shoes of other players rather than viewing games \nsolely from their own perspective. \nThe classic two-player example of game theory is the prisoner\u2019s dilemma.36 We can \nrecast the prisoner\u2019s dilemma in a business context by considering a simple case of \ncapacity addition. Say two competitors, A and B, are considering adding capacity. If \ncompetitor A adds capacity and B doesn\u2019t, A gets an outsized payoff. Likewise, if B adds \ncapacity and A doesn\u2019t, B gets the large payoff. If neither expands, A and B aren\u2019t as \nwell-off as if one alone had added capacity. But if both add capacity, they\u2019re worse-off of \nthan if they had done nothing.

The incumbent\u2019s challenge is to \ndetermine the pricing strategy that maximizes the value of it\u2019s established product. \nExhibit 26 shows the payoffs given various assumptions.

In reality, companies interact with one another all the time. So \nwe can enhance our perspective by considering repeated games. \nSocial scientist Robert Axelrod ran a tournament to see which strategy was most \nsuccessful in an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma.38 The winner was tit for tat. Tit for tat starts \nby cooperating, but then mimics its competitor\u2019s last move. So if a competitor cuts price, \na company employing tit for tat would cut price as well. If the competitor then raises \nprices, tit for tat immediately follows. In practice, tit for tat is effective only if companies \ncan judge clearly the intentions of their competitors. \nWe have found game theory particularly useful in considering pricing strategies and \ncapacity additions.39 A thorough review of a firm\u2019s pricing actions and capacity shifts, as \nwell as for the industry, can provide important perspective on rivalry and rationality. The \ninstitutional memory, especially for cyclical businesses, appears too short to recognize \ncircumstances in which aiming for cooperation is the most profitable strategy. \nThe way to go beyond the payoff matrix that considers only onetime interaction is to \nbuild a tree based on sequential actions. The approach here is similar to strategy in \nchess: look ahead and reason back.40 \nExhibit 27 is an example of a game tree developed by Sharon Oster. Firm 1 is \nconsidering whether to continue only with its first product or to add a second product. In \neither case, Firm 2 can respond with its own product move. The payoffs at the end of \nthe tree show the economic consequences of the various scenarios. In reality, such \nanalysis can be tricky because the range of alternatives is large. But these game trees \ncan provide important perspective on competitive interaction, and hence the prospects \nfor sustainable value creation. \n"

      "text": "Measuring the Moat \n16 December 2002 \n \n39 \n \n \nWhat about Brands? \nWhen queried about sustainable competitive advantage, many executives and investors \ncite the importance of brands. How significant are brands? \nWe can start with an empirical observation: Of the companies that own the top fifteen \nmost valuable brands, as measured by brand consultant Interbrand, four do not earn \ntheir cost of capital.41 (See Exhibit 28.) So a brand is clearly not sufficient to ensure that \na company earns economic profits, much less sustainable economic profits. \nExhibit 28: Brand Popularity Does Not Translate into Value Creation \n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nCOCA-COLA\nMICROSOFT\nIBM\nGE\nINTEL\nNOKIA\nDISNEY\nMCDONALD'S\nMARLBORO\nMERCEDES\nFORD\nTOYOTA\nCITIBANK\nHEWLETT-PACKARD\nAMERICAN EXPRESS\nCISCO\nAT&T\nHONDA\nGILLETTE\nBMW\nSONY\nNESCAFE\nORACLE\nBUDWEISER\nMERRILL LYNCH\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nRank\nReturns minus Opportunity Cost\nSource: Interbrand, CSFB HOLT.  \nWe believe the best way to approach brands is to think through the added-value lens. \nDoes the brand increase willingness to pay? The answer is affirmative if the brand \nconfers horizontal differentiation. So your willingness to pay might be higher for a brand \nif you\u2019re in the habit of using that product (Coke versus Pepsi, or Pepsi versus Coke), \nhave an emotional connection to it, trust the product, or believe the product brings you \nsocial status.  \nLess likely, brands may reduce supplier opportunity cost. A fledgling supplier often tries \nto land a prestigious company, even at a discounted price, as part of its effort to \nestablish credibility. To the degree that brand plays a role in the perception of prestige \nor credibility, it can reduce supplier opportunity cost, and hence increase added value \nfor the branded company. \nExhibit 29 shows that brand itself is not a source of competitive advantage. The exhibit \nexamines the total shareholder returns versus the S&P 500 for the stewards of three top \nbrands, Disney (DIS, $16.87, Outperform, $24.00), Gillette (G, $29.92, Not Rated), and \nCoca-Cola. Each panel shows a similar pattern: a period of significant share price \nunderperformance followed by a change in strategy and a period of sustained \noutperformance. In every case, the brand was well known before and after the company \nperformed well. The brand is the not the key to competitive advantage; the key is how \nthe company uses the brand to generate added value. \n \n"

Management skill entails both fashioning the strategy\u2014the subject of this \nanalysis\u2014and execution of the strategy. While execution is critical, a detailed treatment \nof the subject lies beyond the scope of this report.  \nOne classic example of the importance of execution is Home Depot. In an effort to \nsecure financing in its early days, Home Depot provided an executive from a foreign-\nbased firm with access to the company\u2019s early plans, including store blueprints and \nexpansion intentions. After the parent company decided against an investment in Home \nDepot, the executive turned around and started a copycat business in states where \nHome Depot hadn\u2019t yet expanded. The business floundered even with all of Home \nDepot\u2019s numbers and business plans. Home Depot eventually acquired the failing \ncompetitor. 42  \nThe core of execution is in three processes\u2014the people process, the strategy process, \nand the operations process. Executives must chose and promote people in light of the \nstrategic and operational realities. Strategy must take into account the company\u2019s ability \nto execute it. And managers need to link operations to strategic goals and human \ncapacity. 43  \nLarge companies have a particular challenge because of the significant complexity of \nmanaging a large employee base. Companies must find organizational structures that \nallow them sufficient flexibility in a fast-changing world.    \nAnother important related topic is management incentives. Sustainable value creation \nrequires a constant balancing act between delivering current results and allocating the \nappropriate resources to assure a vibrant and value-creating business in the future. \nIncentives can play a central role in shaping this tenuous balance.  \n"

Accordingly, an \ninvestor\u2019s task is to anticipate revisions in those expectations. A firm grasp on the \nprospects for value creation is a critical facet of this analysis. But value creation itself is \nno assurance of superior stock price performance if the market fully anticipates that \nvalue creation. \nThe expectations investing process has three parts:44 \n1. Estimate price-implied expectations. We first read the expectations embedded \nin a stock with a long-term discounted cash flow model. We use a DCF model \nbecause it mirrors the way the market prices stocks. \n2. Identify expectations opportunities. Once we understand expectations, we apply \nthe appropriate strategic and financial tools to determine where and when \nrevisions are likely to occur. A proper expectations analysis reveals whether a \nstock price is most sensitive to revisions in a company\u2019s sales, operating costs, \nor investment need, so that investors can focus on the revisions that matter \nmost. The strategic analysis in this report is the heart of security analysis, and \nprovides the surest means to anticipate expectations revisions. \n3. Buy, sell, or hold. Using expected-value analysis, we are now in a position to \nmake informed buy, sell, or hold decisions. \nA thorough analysis of a company\u2019s prospects for sustainable value creation is \nessential.

This guideline is subject to change \ndepending on several factors, including general market conditions. \nRestricted: CSFB policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, \nincluding an investment recommendation, during the course of CSFB's engagement in an investment \nbanking transaction and in certain other circumstances. \nVolatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or \nmore in a month in at least 8 of the past 24 months or the analyst expects significant volatility going \nforward.  All IPO stocks are automatically rated volatile within the first 12 months of trading. \n  \nAnalyst\u2019s coverage universe weightings are defined as follows: \nOverweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 \nmonths. \nMarket Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the \nnext 12 months. \nUnderweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 \nmonths. \nCSFB\u2019s distribution of stock ratings (and banking clients) is: \nGlobal Ratings Distribution* \nOutperform \n 35% \n(47% banking clients) \nNeutral \n 42% \n(41% banking clients) \nUnderperform \n 21% \n(35% banking clients) \nRestricted \n 2% \n*For purposes of the NYSE and NASD ratings distribution disclosure requirements, our stock ratings of Outperform, Neutral, and \nUnderperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold, and Sell, respectively; however, the meanings are not the same, as our stock \nratings are determined on a relative basis. (Please refer to definitions above.) An investor's decision to buy or sell a security should be \nbased on investment objectives, current holdings, and other individual factors. \nCredit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Limited (CSFB) acts as broker to WMT. \nDisclosures continue on next page. \n"

The price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments \nmentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or \nfinancial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADR\u2019s, the values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. \nStructured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and assuming the risks involved.  The \nmarket value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market \nconditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer.  Any investor interested in purchasing a structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult \nwith their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. \nSome investments discussed in this report may have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that investment is realised. Those losses \nmay equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment and, in such circumstances, you may be required to pay more money to \nsupport those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make the investment may be used as part of that income yield.  Some investments may not be readily \nrealisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.  \nThis report may provide the addresses of, or contain hyperlinks to, websites.
